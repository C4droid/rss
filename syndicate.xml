<p data-line-id="ad738b8dba3c4d1ca6223e9f939e0ee8"> VIENNA – The far right has emerged as the most dynamic political force in many countries around the world, partly because right-wing populists are adept at presenting themselves as protectors of beleaguered national identity and sovereignty. </p><p data-line-id="6a268a531603494cbf0d6e405b65627e"> US President Donald Trump is the most obvious example. Soon after taking office, he <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1885833185012896054">insisted</a> that protecting Americans from “the flood of illegal aliens and drugs pouring across our Borders” was his “duty as President,” casting his immigration and trade policies as a form of national salvation. </p><p data-line-id="8c8ccea5d54e4c1db67ee1953d129f6f"> Other right-wing leaders – including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, India’s Narendra Modi, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as well as prominent political figures like Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom and Marine Le Pen in France – rely on similar nationalist and xenophobic tropes. </p><p data-line-id="f6c38cf1895346379767aa07db9b9b4e"> Liberal elites, having long rejected nationalism, tend to regard such rhetoric as retrograde. In the West, especially, nationalism was discredited in the aftermath of World War II, and appeals to national identity were largely abandoned in favor of an emphasis on individual autonomy. </p><p data-line-id="8601b42e301f4f038cb615c47d768e95"> Yet surveys <a href="https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9780192580139_A39042698/preview-9780192580139_A39042698.pdf">consistently show</a> that nationality still shapes most people’s sense of self. While this may seem paradoxical, the modern world’s primary political units are nation-states, so national identity is, in a sense, built in. Studies also find that belonging to a large collective helps us <a href="https://eclass.uowm.gr/modules/document/file.php/NURED262/%CE%A0%CE%A1%CE%A9%CE%A4%CE%9F%CE%A4%CE%A5%CE%A0%CE%91%20%CE%91%CE%A1%CE%98%CE%A1%CE%91/Tajfel%20et%20al%20social%20categorization%20and%20intergroup%20behaviour%201971%20EJSP.pdf#:~:text=The%20aim%20of%20the%20studies%20was%20to,conditions%20were%20satisfied%20in%20the%20experimental%20design.">categorize</a> the world and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9738312/">situate ourselves</a> within it, enhancing our <a href="https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology0000hogg_o8n6">self-esteem</a> and reducing the risk of social alienation. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="240dceb1f2ca4fc9b9dcb264f78b075a"> The reflexive liberal dismissal of national identity did not make it any less meaningful. Instead, it created a vacuum that political entrepreneurs rushed to fill. In the absence of a compelling liberal conception of the self, many fell back on traditional – and often exclusionary – markers such as ethnicity, race, and religion. Far-right leaders then used this form of identity politics to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cultural-backlash/3C7CB32722C7BB8B19A0FC005CAFD02B">stoke</a> fear of immigrants, supposedly unassimilable minorities, and supranational bodies imposing unwanted laws. </p><p data-line-id="99eba432aeb24645bcad364c8969493e"> Too often, progressives have ignored these anxieties or treated their causes as problems that technocratic policymaking could fix, failing to recognize how closely tied they are to voters’ cultural identity. Little wonder, then, that so many countries’ politics are now defined by a resurgent far right and a liberal establishment struggling to regain its footing. </p><p data-line-id="0a72bd56a06a4f1fa57c0480ab37c3e1"> To counter the far right’s exclusionary nationalism and relentless fearmongering, liberals must craft a unifying political and cultural narrative. But what ideals should anchor such a creed? While an emphasis on shared values is vital, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691118598/constitutional-patriotism">constitutional patriotism</a> on its own is too abstract to provide real social cohesion. A narrow focus on good governance is also risky, since even well-run systems can falter. </p><p data-line-id="96b32bcba1f245a2847c09ac96187fd0"> Three criteria are essential to developing an enduring political faith. First, it must have an emotional core. Its specific form will likely vary by country, but emotion is indispensable. </p><p data-line-id="acc495098a3d4421be5bde912d44660a"> Western progressives can draw inspiration from the protest movement that swept Israel in 2023. In mass rallies across the country, patriotic protesters cast themselves as the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/american-liberals-israel-protests-patriotism/673540/">true defenders</a> of Israel’s national identity, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to impose an authoritarian vision incompatible with its democratic and Jewish character outlined in the <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/israel.asp">Declaration of Independence</a>. </p><p data-line-id="fb898a6cc77849c8b1d0110bedcf3dbe"> A similar dynamic played out in Poland. Ahead of the <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/warschau/21049.pdf">2023 parliamentary election</a>, opposition parties framed EU membership as integral to the country’s Western identity, warning that the then-ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party’s authoritarian turn put it at risk. </p><p data-line-id="2401504dc814437ea2a27b29a88d775b"> Brazil’s experience shows that counternarratives can also be driven by external pressures. In response to Trump’s attacks on Brazilian sovereignty, President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/brazil-lula-trump-bolsonaro.html">championed</a> an independent, pluralistic Brazil while portraying his far-right opponents – especially former President Jair Bolsonaro – as deferential to US interests. </p><p data-line-id="098783396d6d4fec90a5a27a153265b8"> A successful liberal-nationalist narrative must also be genuinely inclusive, capable of mobilizing a broad electoral coalition by reaching across demographic, social, and class divides. As Lula <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-lula-independence-day-bolsonaro-military-parade-92d1ca54f7fbf64e77516eba779133d6">put it</a>, a country “belongs to the military, the teacher, the doctor, the dentist, the lawyer, the hot dog vendor, the small and medium individual entrepreneur.” </p><p data-line-id="943bf4a982514289b5d7d805cc18c72b"> Lastly, because humans have an <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-end-of-the-postnational-illusion/">inherent need</a> for belonging, any effective political narrative must foster a sense of community and shared destiny. That requires reclaiming national symbols that the far right has hijacked and imbuing them with democratic values. Rob Jetten’s recent victory over far-right leader Geert Wilders in the Dutch parliamentary election – driven in part by his strategic use of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/02/dutch-voters-positivity-liberals-patriotism-d66-netherlands-election">national symbols</a> – offers a useful model. Civil-society groups and opposition parties in Israel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/01/donald-tusk-tells-election-rally-in-warsaw-change-for-the-better-is-inevitable-poland">Poland</a>, and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/05/08/brazil-s-lula-launches-his-presidential-campaign-with-uncharacteristic-restraint_5982827_4.html">Brazil</a> have likewise made national flags central to their campaigns. </p><p data-line-id="a1343bf0fa9745e6b59c8c762eb370a1"> But liberal nationalism shouldn’t rest on a single story; it should grow out of multiple narratives that reinforce one another and reflect a shared civic vision. Crucially, the aim is not to win over hardened xenophobes – it is to reach moderate and conservative voters who care deeply about their countries and may back illiberal leaders out of fear. In today’s polarized political landscape, even small shifts in public opinion can determine whether the future belongs to authoritarians or to those committed to open, democratic societies. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="5d5f160eba3241a8aae1940bec284716"> MORRISVILLE, VERMONT/OSLO – The consequences of <a href="https://global-tipping-points.org/">climate tipping points</a> are almost too big to imagine. The thought that, over the course of a few decades, the Amazon rainforest could become a savannah, or coral reefs could become extinct, seems like science fiction. Given how many people have been lulled into a false sense of control over the environment, it is perhaps even harder to grasp that incremental changes in temperature and rainfall irreversibly reorganize planetary-scale systems. </p><p data-line-id="a3cab8d7016b4188b1c724cab5eecbfb"> But data from ever-more advanced Earth system models indicate that these tipping points are fast approaching or may, in the case of <a href="https://global-tipping-points.org/earth-system-tipping-points/">coral reefs and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet</a>, already be in the rear-view mirror. And it is <a href="https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/16/939/2025/">not at all clear</a> that climate interventions could make the problem go away. </p><p data-line-id="dfb490615ce44acbafbee91ca940e08b"> Institutions at all levels are not prepared to manage such possibilities. The current processes for synthesizing climate science into policy recommendations are stronger for global-scale changes than they are for the local insights that a city planner in Jakarta, a finance minister in Brazil, or a farmer in the Sahel needs. That is because these processes are better equipped to highlight the areas of agreement than they are to map the terrain of uncertainty. </p><p data-line-id="d54c8059da69492294db052443b16518"> Most infrastructure plans, policy frameworks, financial markets, and risk-management strategies do not recognize the possibility of crossing climate tipping points, which are foreseeable but not predictable. This makes it difficult to weigh investments in immediate needs against the future effects of such spending. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="d17b6def7d65458e9101b60e4c0050fd"> The lack of capacity to respond to climate tipping points must be addressed now. Reducing the risk of crossing them poses a global collective-action problem, especially because they cover different domains. For example, many factors contribute to coral reef collapse, including global warming, ocean acidification, ecosystem loss, pollution runoff, and overfishing. And yet climate science, biodiversity research, pollution monitoring, and resource management are consigned to separate silos, leaving nobody responsible for monitoring and mitigating tipping dynamics. </p><p data-line-id="e1c7fe4ce6684849a2b3d32dc8a827f7"> Building the institutional architecture for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589811624000168">tipping-point governance</a> comes down to <a href="https://tial.org/publications/interchange-design-building-blocks-for-complex-science-policy-challenges/">three essential tasks</a>. The first is continuous tracking of tipping dynamics – including human and social dimensions – and the development of a shared, actionable understanding of them. The second is increased recognition of the risks, which means ensuring that they are central considerations in government and business decision-making. Lastly, it is important to establish the capacity for timely, coordinated response across policy domains, sectors, and scales.  </p><p data-line-id="4c4bf5db004f478ca84603da4f125d48"> In a <a href="https://global-tipping-points.org/governance/">concept note</a> for the Global Tipping Points Report 2025, we show how these capacities can be developed through regional Tipping Element Monitoring and Response Facilities (TEMRFs) which would share information and coordinate action as needed. Each TEMRF would focus on a specific tipping element and be regionally grounded – but globally networked. These facilities could weave together existing regional frameworks for cooperation, including networks of scientists, policymakers, city governments, Indigenous peoples, and diplomats. </p><p data-line-id="01e370cc0ea5421bbaf313d7d8b34209"> TEMRFs can learn from other initiatives that have developed new ways of synthesizing climate science for decision-makers, such as the World Climate Research Programme’s <a href="https://www.wcrp-climate.org/my-climate-risk">My Climate Risk Lighthouse Activity</a>, the <a href="https://www.amap.no/">Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme</a>, the Science Panels for the <a href="https://www.sp-amazon.org/">Amazon</a>, the <a href="https://www.spcongobasin.org/">Congo Basin</a>, and <a href="https://www.unsdsn.org/our-work/science-panel-for-borneo/">Borneo</a>, and the <a href="https://otca.org/en/project/amazon-regional-observatory/">Amazon Regional Observatory</a>. These programs have demonstrated how to represent systemic risks in a tangible way that is tailored to different stakeholders. TEMRFs should follow their example by aggregating information from a wide range of sources – such as quantitative models, satellite data, and indigenous knowledge – and creating a comprehensive picture for various audiences. </p><p data-line-id="226d3b53249b4cdfaf9923227a6b0169"> Political and business leaders, with their focus on election cycles and quarterly earnings, need contextual frameworks that recognize and incorporate the risks of crossing climate tipping points. To that end, TEMRFs will have to consider decades-long time horizons and ensure that tipping elements are a part of policy frameworks for infrastructure planning, financial regulation, and development policy. Tough trade-offs – between short-term growth and long-term resilience, and between preserving the status quo and adapting to new realities – will be unavoidable. </p><p data-line-id="ac84f7acc4e040cfb1d3c2643944c67b"> Lastly, TEMRFs must organize responses at a scale and pace that matches the urgency of the situation. The Amazon rainforest spans nine countries, and ocean currents connect continents; both have tipping dynamics with local to global impacts unfolding over complicated time scales. This requires institutions capable of coordinating action across jurisdictions, bridging the public and private sectors, and responding flexibly to changing conditions. </p><p data-line-id="1f1bb662657643ff995a6e5c0f1fdd84"> Regional bodies are well positioned to achieve these objectives because they are close enough to see the effects of crossing tipping points, and large enough to devise and implement coordinated cross-border measures. Organizations like the Nordic Council of Ministers or the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization could play important roles in developing this architecture, drawing on their experience of navigating evolving concerns with incomplete mandates. Regional development banks and alliances around shared interests such as the International Coral Reef Initiative can also be good starting points. </p><p data-line-id="7d40d1f0e2f6430e9ce4cb8ac661324d"> There is a deeper imperative for strengthening regional capacities. Global efforts often falter under the weight of profound inequities and lingering mistrust – both between and within countries – about whose interests are really being served. In this context, Earth system tipping points can easily be framed and perceived as yet another agenda pushed from the Global North to discipline development elsewhere. TEMRFs chart a different course: creating space for regions to claim their voice, cultivate their own scientific capabilities and grounded insights, and work with stakeholders across scales to shape development pathways rooted in their own geographies and the Earth systems that sustain them.  </p><p data-line-id="37acfc1cd67849678d66669bb5529eff"> TEMRFs offer a way to connect global ambition with regional realities – on terms defined by those who live them. </p>

<p data-line-id="c188d8b30be140a58e3eeadce7f34061"> OXFORD – When OpenAI recently committed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-does-not-want-government-guarantees-massive-ai-data-center-buildout-ceo-2025-11-06/">$1.4 trillion</a> to securing future computing capacity, it was merely the latest indication of irrational exuberance in 2025. By some <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/data-centers-gdp-growth-zero-first-half-2025-jason-furman-harvard-economist/">estimates</a>, US GDP growth in the first half of this year came almost entirely from data centers, prompting a flood of commentary about when the bubble will burst and what it may leave behind. While the late 1990s dot-com party ended with a hangover for Wall Street, Main Street kept what mattered: the infrastructure. Productivity rose, and the fiber laid during the boom years still works today. US President Bill Clinton’s vow to build a “bridge to the 21st century” was one of those rare campaign promises that is actually fulfilled. </p>

<p data-line-id="59094041902a45888a1b51db21b67f6a"> LUXEMBOURG – We are experiencing a period of intense, profound change on the international stage, as the strategic alliances and institutions that have guided the world for the last half-century are being called into question. Conflicts that once seemed resolved are being reignited, and leaders coming to power now will shape the world order for decades to come. </p>
<p data-line-id="d115e18cf4774fecad531f99bcb26723"> Against this backdrop, while some are rushing to build walls, we in the European Union are building bridges. We are reaffirming our commitment to an international order based on democratic values, human rights, mutual respect, and win-win partnerships. This was the EU’s message at the recent summit with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. </p>
<p data-line-id="c4426d98f6d14128aed295774d0f0eca"> Members of this particular transatlantic community have come a long way together, and in Santa Marta, Colombia – Latin America’s oldest city, colloquially known as “the heart of the world” – we strengthened our bond. The reasons for doing so were obvious. We know that, together, we can ensure a safer, more democratic world and promote fairer, more sustainable development for our societies. </p>
<p data-line-id="4cc6144e56224ed38ee1b41dbe2fd06c"> Together, the European Union, Latin America, and the Caribbean <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-celac-relations">represent</a> more than one billion people, 14% of the world’s population, and 21% of global GDP. We account for one-third of all United Nations members and share one of the world’s strongest alliances, rooted in a common history, shared values, some of the densest trade networks in the world, and – above all – a will to move forward together. By strengthening this partnership, we can go from amplifying to multiplying our impact on the emerging international order. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="3068b9087b0845998840327932fe1e59"> The European Investment Bank (EIB) is playing a key role in strengthening this relationship. Throughout our 45 years of work in Latin America and the Caribbean, we have built enduring relationships of trust, financing more than 350 <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2025-441-el-bei-movilizara-1-150-millones-de-dolares-para-mejorar-el-sistema-electrico-e-impulsar-la-energia-limpia-en-centroamerica">high-impact projects</a> to boost economic growth, raise living standards, and strengthen communities. </p>
<p data-line-id="ac466173535347af9b3a172435ffd3e9"> These investments are supporting major energy, transportation, and telecommunications infrastructure projects, improving climate-change adaptation and resilience, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises, and promoting female entrepreneurship. We have helped fund microloans for women in Brazil; a green hydrogen platform in Chile; electrical interconnections in Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica; and the construction of sustainable transportation networks such as the metros in Bogotá, Quito, and São Paulo. </p>
<p data-line-id="3990d66680914186a5927e54c88d98af"> By the end of this year, we will have reached a record level of EIB financing in the region, with the final figure exceeding $3 billion. That includes contracts just signed in Santa Marta for solar energy in Colombia and water sanitation in Ecuador – projects that will benefit more than 2.5 million people. We have also announced a new $1.15 billion program to support electricity interconnections in Central America. </p>
<p data-line-id="b623892922234995a12398e5d1429489"> In parallel with the Santa Marta summit, the EIB is playing an active part at the concurrent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, further consolidating its role as a climate bank. The recent losses and catastrophic damage inflicted by Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean demonstrate the urgency of investing more in prevention and adaptation. And that is what we are doing: 70% of our investments in Latin America and the Caribbean are allocated to climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="276654007b0647a9a6ca7c949b1e76f0"> At a time when many countries and political leaders are taking steps back and looking inward, the EU and the EIB’s commitments to multilateralism and the green transition are stronger than ever. These are challenges that we can solve only if we work together. That is why our discussions in Santa Marta also focused on strengthening cooperation with the other multilateral development banks active in the region, especially CAF (the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean) and the Inter-American Development Bank. </p>
<p data-line-id="fd71807f32e14ab385313a30b589fea5"> Such multilateral partnerships are essential to achieving our shared goals. If we continue to move forward in the spirit of partnership that was on display in Santa Marta, reinforcing our alliances and strengthening our friendships, I am convinced that shaping the international order for the better is well within our reach.  </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="8bbb7cd8abbe440bbf9b6f1fb7240216"> CAIRO – For decades, the international community has operated under the illusion that climate action and development are different pursuits, each with its own goals, institutions, and funding mechanisms. This approach has hindered progress on both agendas. </p>
<p data-line-id="20f88ef044474d0e8ea5253b74b45ddc"> The world leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) must recognize this and begin transforming the fragmented, underperforming climate-finance system into an integrated framework that delivers on both climate and development objectives. As they embark on this process, it is worth considering the main takeaways from <a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/isbn/9783111590486/html"><em>Policy-Driven Climate and Development Finance: Strategies for Equitable Solutions</em></a>, the forthcoming volume of essays that I edited. </p>
<p data-line-id="6b8fd428af514fcda49bda0b53ef7d20"> While making the global financial architecture more equitable and efficient is a long-term project, delegates at COP30 can take important steps forward. First, they must deliver a replicable and scalable model for climate finance that translates pledges into predictable flows, provides measurable results, and allows for country ownership. This is necessary to narrow the climate-finance gap, especially because developing countries will require between $5.1-6.8 trillion through 2030 to meet their <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2024_L22_adv.pdf">nationally determined contributions</a>, while their <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2023">adaptation finance needs</a> are 10-18 times greater than international public-finance flows. </p>
<p data-line-id="5f2a58e402ac4a1294d156a0d6a2625a"> A good example of this kind of model is the <a href="https://www.environmental-finance.com/content/analysis/tfff-could-reshape-how-investors-engage-in-development-finance.html">Tropical Forests Forever Facility</a>, an ambitious blended-finance mechanism designed to unlock large amounts of both public and private capital for the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests. If this facility successfully channels annual payments to tropical forest countries, it will show how climate finance that is anchored in outcomes can preserve biodiversity, support local livelihoods, and, crucially, advance development. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="261b177e1dd64e1f8926193246d46019"> COP30 must also focus on efficiency. The climate-finance system is not only underfunded but also fragmented. Developing countries are forced to navigate an ever-growing number of funds, each with its own procedures and reporting requirements. This bureaucratic thicket, coupled with co-financing conditions and weak coordination among institutions, can delay projects for years, while too much money is wasted on transaction costs. </p>
<p data-line-id="7a1c884bcc4f4ffc97a15ea87012c47d"> At the heart of this inefficiency lies the cost of capital. Green investments often come with high interest rates for developing economies. According to the International Energy Agency, the cost of financing green energy in developing countries can be <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/financial-headwinds-for-renewables-investors-whats-the-way-forward">2-3 times higher</a> than in advanced economies, significantly constraining the pace of the low-carbon transition. This disparity is less about project risk and more about structural biases, such as sovereign credit ratings that underestimate resilience, volatile currencies, and persistent debt overhangs. </p>
<p data-line-id="d18cea0a9a334ff2ab619fa149db199f"> The G20 has recognized the problem and recently hosted a <a href="https://au.int/en/newsevents/20251110/g20-africa-high-level-dialogue-debt-sustainability-cost-capital">high-level dialogue</a> with the African Union on debt sustainability, the cost of capital, and financing reforms. The group must now deliver viable solutions: more dynamic and liquid local capital markets, financial instruments that reduce currency risk, and de-risking mechanisms that attract private investors on fair terms. Multilateral development banks, for their part, should reform their mandates and risk frameworks to provide more capital, more cheaply and more quickly. </p>
<p data-line-id="27034f4abd594f42a14a14781bfefd59"> But increasing efficiency also requires injecting a new sense of urgency into the process. For communities at risk of being displaced by floods and droughts, a year-long approval cycle for climate financing can turn a disaster into a catastrophe. COP30 must push for accelerated disbursement standards, simplified access procedures, and other measures to streamline operations. </p>
<p data-line-id="0f9befdb90fb4e30bcb2641c2a1f2dd2"> Lastly, there is the question of fairness. The <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2023">majority of climate-finance flows</a> are concentrated within the G20 and focused on mitigation. At the same time, developing countries are grappling with unsustainable debt burdens, which have narrowed their fiscal space and crowded out climate and development spending. </p>
<p data-line-id="eac7fda3bcf64f3083169b01560ed993"> The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Confronting-the-Debt-Crisis_11-Actions_Report.pdf">11 recommendations</a> by the UN Secretary-General’s Expert Group on Debt offer a roadmap for addressing this silent debt crisis. The proposed reforms cover three broad areas: restructuring and modernizing the multilateral financial system; providing borrowing countries with technical and capacity-building assistance; and encouraging borrowers to adopt more effective strategies for debt management. Implementing these recommendations would help low- and middle-income countries redirect resources from debt service toward investment in sustainable growth. </p>
<p data-line-id="0a9781c7a5d3431b829caaf803e4c96d"> Instruments such as debt-for-climate and debt-for-nature swaps can complement these efforts by ensuring that financial relief is linked to climate and environmental protection and creating fiscal space for spending on development goals. A just climate transition requires concessional finance, which should be seen not as charity, but rather as a shared investment in global resilience. </p>
<p data-line-id="8df1165e7f7b438ba68c09c3912326a3"> Integrated finance is the only viable path forward, because a government that invests in climate action such as resilient agriculture or green transport is also advancing development goals. The global financial architecture must reflect that reality. </p>
<p data-line-id="d722c476d2aa4712922c437282c165bf"> COP30 can bring about a move in this direction. Governments can commit to incorporating climate and development finance into their budgets. International institutions can begin to streamline rules, align metrics, and ensure transparency. And both public and private actors can expand the use of innovative tools – from voluntary carbon markets to regional project platforms – that support local transformation. </p>
<p data-line-id="23ecc35f1556449da0b4ca3b1c1cc8c7"> No country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting climate change. The shortcomings of the climate-finance architecture must be addressed. Public financial flows remain indispensable not only for equity, but also for leverage – every dollar spent effectively can mobilize many more in private capital. Whether COP30 is <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/cop30-what-would-make-the-conference-a-success-by-maria-fernanda-espinosa-et-al-2025-09">considered a success</a> largely depends on its ability to maximize the impact of these flows on climate and development outcomes. </p>

<p data-line-id="426e8039bbc440c3b6bbf652d491263a"> TEL AVIV – US President Donald Trump is probably not even aware of John Maynard Keynes’s 1919 book <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/keynes-the-economic-consequences-of-the-peace"><em>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</em></a>, which cautioned that the harsh demands imposed on Germany after World War I – with their “unjust and unworkable economic basis” – would destabilize all of Europe. But Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan reflects one of Keynes’s most important insights, embodied by the warning that the “perils of the future lay not in frontiers and sovereignties, but in food, coal, and transport.” </p>

<p data-line-id="e830beb8e8f4449cb6acdb0a45963124"> PARIS – Around the world, energy systems are undergoing profound, rapid transformations that will leave them looking dramatically different a decade from now. A major driver is the increasing electrification of the global economy. Not only are more people adopting electric vehicles, heat pumps, and smart (digitally interconnected) appliances; we are also witnessing explosive growth in the construction of electricity-hungry data centers, many of them powering AI. Owing to these trends, the International Energy Agency has <a href="https://x.com/fbirol/status/1846400954536460734?s=20">projected</a> that electricity demand will grow six times faster than overall energy demand by 2035. </p><p data-line-id="9caa1bfdf72e4d50b01251cbc2caaea1"> The supply side of the energy sector is also evolving rapidly. Renewable energy sources, especially solar, are <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">set to play</a> increasingly significant roles in power systems globally. These trends and technologies could deliver greater energy independence and lower emissions if the right policies and infrastructure are in place. But they also add a layer of complexity to grid management, because operators must account for variable flows of electricity while ensuring reliability and affordability for consumers. </p><p data-line-id="1fb8d1b3e3604c9d83721121400e409a"> Grids also need to power more places and things. By 2030, homes and businesses will have <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai">more than 30 billion</a> digitally connected devices, twice as many as today. To keep pace, energy systems’ flexibility – their ability to respond in a timely manner to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand – must increase much faster than is currently expected.  </p><p data-line-id="71ba988fefe74af9aa0c9018e117957f"> Digitalization could be the key to closing the gap, even as it introduces new hurdles. Digital tools for optimizing power systems can improve efficiency, enhance affordability, and strengthen energy security. And AI, especially, has huge potential to strengthen and streamline electricity systems. As recent <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/energy-and-ai-observatory?tab=AI+for+energy">case studies</a> make clear, models and tools that are already available can better predict the output of weather-sensitive sources of generation, assist with aligning supply and demand throughout the day, and help detect and correct infrastructure anomalies as they arise. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="2772632c15d542ac99e900dd55764c5d"> But to make the most of these opportunities, certain challenges need to be managed. Even when the lion’s share of new demand- and supply-side technologies are digitally enabled – implying the potential to be connected to other digital systems – they tend to operate in isolation. Often, they feature proprietary designs, lack standardized interfaces, and do not have the necessary functionality to interact dynamically with the grid. Such fragmentation creates unnecessary inefficiencies, raises costs, stifles innovation, and makes it harder to realize the benefits of digitalization on a broader scale. </p><p data-line-id="3e613cb633ff4ebb85e77ff027a4431e"> That is why it is not enough for our energy systems merely to be furnished with digital capabilities. They also must become interoperable so that new technologies can be introduced and integrated seamlessly. When every node on the network can communicate effectively, those managing the system can achieve desired outcomes faster.  </p><p data-line-id="51b9ffb6576e49faabf5f78f895d3508"> If well implemented, greater interoperability between digital technologies on both the demand and supply sides of the energy sector can deliver real dividends. Smart EV chargers could shift charging to times when renewable generation is high. Modern thermostats and appliances could respond to price signals in real time, helping to reduce peak electricity consumption. Rooftop solar systems could be aggregated to provide power to grids when needed. With the right frameworks, these resources can work together, driving progress toward the energy goals that countries and communities have set.  </p><p data-line-id="9c35f0e1438a4d3591f8589e5639f36a"> Unless we do more to ensure interoperability, we risk a future of squandered potential, missed opportunities, stranded investments, and rising energy-security threats. Cyberattacks on energy utilities have already more than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai">tripled</a> in frequency over the past four years, and now AI is making the attacks more sophisticated. Yet we know that interoperable systems built on common standards can be more resilient to such threats.  </p><p data-line-id="cb64bb4138c0418795c8b46096bed9a2"> That is why we are calling for governments and industry to collaborate and work toward strong, secure digitalized energy systems. More than ever, we need a shared vision and long-term planning. Recent proposals for a <a href="https://energy.becknprotocol.io/">Digital Energy Grid</a> aim to create a unified digital backbone for the energy ecosystem by introducing universal identity, machine readability, and verifiability. Since these features would enable transparent, reliable, and interoperable energy transactions, they should be taken up in earnest. </p><p data-line-id="dc48ce8d35284690ad82dbd1e73bc23c"> Building on these ideas, India is already taking a calibrated step forward with the launch of the India Energy Stack. The IES aims to build a digital public infrastructure that <a href="https://fsrglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IES-Concept-Brief.pdf">enables</a> identification and value exchange across a multitude of actors and assets through uniform specifications and standards. </p><p data-line-id="5ca36fec85814468aface64bf400419e"> Energy systems will continue to be transformed one way or another. We must act now to ensure that the systems that emerge reflect thoughtful design choices. That means fostering global cooperation and creating shared forms of infrastructure that will work for everyone. </p>

<p data-line-id="24a28a6b8d1f4391a0dd11b3c468e62b"> BELÉM – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, has been eagerly awaited worldwide. A COP in the Amazon raises expectations for all those who recognize the urgency of climate change and its impact on our lives and environment. That is why Brazilian President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> is calling this the “COP of Truth.” </p>
<p data-line-id="eadaf355bb6c43378c71f937a6a7cf2c"> As co-hosts for this COP, the Indigenous peoples and local communities of Brazil’s Amazon region understand what is at stake. We are among those who suffer the most from climate change, since our lives and livelihoods are directly connected to the natural ecosystems and biodiversity that global warming threatens. We are also among those who can provide some of the most powerful responses to the problem. For example, territories managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities have deforestation rates up to 50% lower than other <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2021/03/State-of-Worlds-Indigenous-Peoples-Vol-V-Final.pdf">areas</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="cffbf45b510b4ceb92ab4992c0645694"> This is no accident. We are spiritually connected to nature; by relying on traditional knowledge to safeguard our territories, we also protect crucial carbon sinks and ecosystem services that benefit everyone.  </p>
<p data-line-id="426218a180b44600a8df03173721d411"> To meet the urgent goals enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, everyone must recognize the contributions of Indigenous peoples in formulating climate policies. That means recognizing territorial protection and land-tenure policies as inherently effective climate measures.  </p>
<p data-line-id="f89247fee10941029a0a8e8fe45dc2da"> Such recognition also highlights another issue. Historically, Indigenous peoples have received the fewest resources in the flow of climate and environmental finance: <a href="https://www.speciesconservation.org/blog/mbzf-backed-global-study-on-indigenous-peoples-climate-contributions-reaches-a-key-milestone/">less than 1%</a> of all funding actually reaches these territories, which is both inefficient and unjust. That is why the Brazilian government, working closely with other countries and Indigenous organizations, has gone to great lengths to ensure that COP30 benefits those who protect forests. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="1e8f6cceeafb4d70b89cf560e8f06f02"> Among the measures needed to make this a reality is the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, announced at the COP30 World Leaders Summit on November 6. The goal is to recognize and secure a predefined amount of land or territories managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities by 2030. Such a historic agreement is not only ambitious; it is also the first global commitment on land tenure. Brazil has worked with the Forest and Climate Leaders’ Partnership, a coalition of 36 governments and the European Union, to advance this vital commitment, setting the stage for COP30 to become a defining moment in the global climate agenda. </p>
<p data-line-id="1fd17c989a6a41528b523657ae7b3489"> Moreover, donor governments and philanthropic institutions will renew a 2021 <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2025/10/cop26-forest-pledge-to-support-indigenous-local-rights-was-just-met-what-was-learned/">commitment</a> (initially made at COP26 in Glasgow) to allocate another $1.7 billion over the next five years to programs that strengthen land tenure and forests. The original commitment exceeded the initial target, and <a href="https://carbon-pulse.com/436950/">$1.86 billion</a> has already been mobilized. By renewing it, governments and civil society are signaling that they remain as committed as ever to this critical dimension of climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="c3ef01ffd5da4659b75b7e71f11310c5"> After being announced by heads of state and government, these commitments will be formally signed on November 17 at an event showcasing the COP30 Action Agenda, a central theme of which is to achieve a “<a href="https://cop30.br/en/brazilian-presidency/cop-30-circles/global-ethical-stocktake">global ethical balance</a>.” For example, only around 10% of that $1.86 billion is estimated to have been transferred directly to Indigenous peoples and local communities. With the “Pledge 2.0,” and as part of the COP30 Action Agenda, we aim to increase this percentage substantially. Those who manage their territories more effectively deserve to manage a greater share of the resources allocated for territorial protection. </p>
<p data-line-id="dc4d63b3728b4c05bd96312aac863487"> Following the announcement at the World Leaders Summit, the land tenure and financial commitments will be officially launched at an event in the Blue Zone that I will lead on November 17. I will be joined by ministers and officials from other tropical countries, donors, philanthropic institutions, and, of course, Indigenous leaders. </p>
<p data-line-id="7bf8e29713474310892d1780b07b2540"> Moreover, these commitments will serve as the foundation for another major initiative at this COP: the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. Since Indigenous peoples and local communities are essential to guaranteeing the successful implementation of this facility, they will manage at least 20% of the funds it mobilizes.  </p>
<p data-line-id="b25c3aa3b5b14ef08e698bef40d735b2"> These are major breakthroughs, and it is important to remember that they were made possible only because Indigenous peoples and local communities have demanded a voice in decision-making processes. Participation is crucial to recognition. That is why we have a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil, and it is why COP30 will elevate our unique voices and insights. Through my ministry, Indigenous organizations, and other partners, we are making possible the COP Village, an accommodation for three thousand Indigenous people who will be the heart of this COP.  </p>
<p data-line-id="1bf0ff3791e04de1a3b68b93c1b3dae9"> We will also have the largest number of Indigenous people in the world accredited in the Blue Zone, thanks to the COP30 presidency’s creation of a People’s Circle. By offering better forms of participation and advocacy, Brazil has created the conditions for Indigenous peoples and local communities to be heard like never before. </p>
<p data-line-id="7d3af3ae9bbf40b2905de78435fc8848"> Brazil invites all governments, donors, and development institutions to join the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment and to contribute to the renewed Land and Forest Pledge. Only by working together can we protect the world’s ecosystems, strengthen land tenure and the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and invest in people as the foundation for resilient development, a just transition, and lasting climate stability. </p>

proposes building blocks for a coordinated strategy to deliver sustained “blue” investment.        </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="d003c030d9b64e53b7eb2e55a3d31d51"> MONACO – Two major events this summer – the Blue Economy and Finance Forum (BEFF) in Monaco, and the third United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice – reflected the growing recognition that protecting the ocean is not only an environmental issue, but also a political, economic, financial, and social imperative. The challenge now is to translate this rapidly emerging consensus into concrete, sustained action. </p>
<p data-line-id="f33d82cca0914bc8a44aec0e18cb83d3"> Covering over two-thirds of our planet and accounting for 97% of its biosphere, the ocean is a critical ally in our efforts to tackle climate change, ensure food security, and support livelihoods. Without a healthy ocean, sustainable development will remain a distant dream. But protecting and restoring marine ecosystems costs money, and financial flows are falling far short of need. To close this gap, ocean protection must be regarded not as charity, but as an opportunity – a high-value investment in our collective future. </p>
<p data-line-id="4c2b4bc615c940e99fcbb31180300760"> The vision of a thriving ocean economy that offers both short-term profit and long-term value in terms of food security, employment, and resilience galvanized the political leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, philanthropists, and representatives of multilateral organizations and civil society at the BEFF. The event delivered on its goal of unlocking funding for ocean-positive projects, including through innovative instruments like blue bonds and blended-finance vehicles, which combine public, private, and philanthropic resources. It thus represented an important first step toward anchoring ocean protection where it counts: within the financial industry. </p>
<p data-line-id="b464fa7a0037435d9947718dde8c810d"> But the new “blue” investment announced by public, private, and philanthropic actors at the BEFF – amounting to some <a href="https://beff2025monaco.org/images/ANBilanBlue%20Economy%20and%20Finance%20ForumVDEF_11.06.pdf">€8.7 billion ($10.1 billion)</a> – represents only a fraction of what is needed to meet global targets. Moreover, isolated commitments, however ambitious, do not necessarily lead to <a>the sustained</a>, coordinated investment that scaling the blue economy demands. A more strategic approach, which focuses on leveraging public and philanthropic capital to de-risk investment in ocean-positive projects and attract long-term private finance, is urgently needed.  </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="bd39ba97d2114d03bbbdac8fd103568e"> Three imperatives stand out. The first is to create a robust pipeline of investable projects. As it stands, many promising initiatives remain stuck at the pilot stage. A lack of early-stage financing, technical assistance, or enabling policies means that they never get to a point where they are appealing to private investors. </p>
<p data-line-id="e7d9975eaa8f43f386a2c1bb81401b08"> Monaco is doing its part to bridge this gap. The ReOcean Fund – an ocean-focused private equity fund, co-managed by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation (of which I am president) and Monaco Asset Management – has <a href="https://www.fpa2.org/en/news/successful-raise-of-73-million-dollars-for-the-reocean-fund-08499">raised</a> $73 million to invest in companies pioneering technologies that promise to advance critical goals like restoring marine ecosystems and decarbonizing shipping. But the responsibility for sustaining a pipeline of bankable projects ultimately falls to governments and development banks, which must use public finance to redefine investment risk so that it reflects the real economic returns of protecting marine ecosystems. </p>
<p data-line-id="1de5d44a4869400d8c5148f50685caad"> The second imperative is to create enabling conditions for investment. If ocean-relevant sectors – such as shipping, fisheries, coastal infrastructure, and tourism – are to align their activities with the blue-economy vision, they must be guided (and constrained) by net-zero and nature-positive targets that are ambitious and credible. Governments must not only develop and enforce the right rules of the game, including regional marine spatial plans, but also lead by example. That means eliminating poorly designed and harmful government subsidies, such as those driving exploitation of overfished stocks, and using those public resources to finance ocean-positive projects and cover transition costs for ocean-dependent sectors. With WTO Agreement Fish 1 now in force, the world has taken a historic first step toward curbing illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing and protecting vulnerable stocks, while negotiations continue over Fish 2, which will tackle overfishing capacities. </p>
<p data-line-id="10a4515255794ddf8a3ca99688f0e83e"> Public development banks must also do their part to strengthen investor confidence and catalyze market-wide change. At the BEFF, more than 20 public development banks endorsed the Finance in Common Ocean Coalition <a href="https://financeincommon.org/the-fics-ocean-coalition-releases-a-joint-statement-at-the-blue-economy-and-finance-forum-in-monaco">joint statement</a>, which articulated a collective ambition to scale up ocean finance, align portfolios with a regenerative and sustainable blue economy, and support pipeline development by sharing tools and methodologies. These institutions must follow through on these commitments, and their peers must join them. </p>
<p data-line-id="bb7571346fc24f8f83db95f86c060f54"> Finally, financial flows throughout the economy must be aligned with climate, biodiversity, and equity goals. For governments, this means integrating environmental and social externalities into public budgets, with national accounting systems factoring in both the value of ecosystem services and the financial risks arising from environmental degradation. </p>
<p data-line-id="ba9c916fad064506b1893269148bc39c"> Financial actors – including institutional investors, corporations, asset managers, and insurers – also have a critical role to play, not only as funders, but also by stepping up as core architects of a regenerative and sustainable blue economy. To this end, they must create clear taxonomies and metrics, which support consistent decision-making and prevent greenwashing. Blended-finance mechanisms and biodiversity credits and certificates can help provide the right incentives, aligning private finance with measurable sustainability outcomes. </p>
<p data-line-id="768d2f70837042889aa9de1bba80fc3d"> The ocean economy is beginning to take shape. The BEFF laid important foundations, and promising instruments – such as venture capital funds targeting ocean innovation, guarantee facilities supporting small and medium-sized enterprises dedicated to delivering ocean-positive outcomes, and sovereign blue bonds – are gaining traction. But the momentum from the summer must not be squandered. It must be translated into a clear and coordinated strategy for the decade. </p>

<p data-line-id="c90a5bc5c2334abfb1cd75ab0f0b3478"> WASHINGTON, DC – This year marks a historic milestone: for the first time, global renewable-energy production has surpassed coal. In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/global-electricity-mid-year-insights-2025/global-analysis/">more than 34%</a> of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies. </p><p data-line-id="b683da6a2990429a8fb63a49d6f12e18"> As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway. Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.  </p><p data-line-id="2b2fd1f87363409aa6f9c5c2f6bf8bf4"> According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jul/91-Percent-of-New-Renewable-Projects-Now-Cheaper-Than-Fossil-Fuels-Alternatives">91% of new renewable-energy projects</a> are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts. This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/22/global-use-of-coal-hit-record-high-in-2024">ongoing growth</a> in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world. </p><p data-line-id="e076b008dff7475bb5aafa597e398444"> We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away. </p><p data-line-id="77be2c69b72b464483331d01d56f58ed"> To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements. As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="590dc0d4fbc24a05a5c3425c32f397f2"> Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place. Solar projects, for example, can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/climate/africa-world-bank-solar-electricity.html">fail</a> when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.  </p><p data-line-id="dab5f5f65cb744239dea984a7ab7bcc7"> Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation. </p><p data-line-id="67ecf75476db48668f04b1999473b840"> When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels. Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes. And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/why-our-clean-energy-future-depends-emerging-economies--ecmii-2025-09-18/">attract new investment</a>.  </p><p data-line-id="edc7abef78534a79ab2425e938cbd7b6"> The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that <a href="https://www.devcommittee.org/content/dam/sites/devcommittee/doc/documents/2025/Final_DC2025-0002.pdf">1.2 billion young people</a> in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then. Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis. The World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/07/investment-emerging-economies-energy-transition">estimates</a> that the renewables industry alone could generate <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/in-full/2-drivers-of-labour-market-transformation/">more than 30 million jobs</a> and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually. Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Transforming-a-Billion-Lives-The-Job-Creation-Potential-from-a-Green-Power-Transition-in-the-Energy-Poor-World.pdf">a further 500 million new jobs</a> and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones. </p><p data-line-id="b3d1c1e16ae9431d809b268d431e0277"> To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.  </p><p data-line-id="a98d519e906b4c1e9fec6980e86971d9"> Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills. These investments, in turn, have fueled a <a href="https://issuu.com/geapp/docs/global_energy_alliance_2025_impact_report/90">wave of distributed renewable-energy projects</a> that are rapidly transforming local power systems.  </p><p data-line-id="12d0e0b09f134a1e9d485bfe11a8f3b3"> In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel. My organization is <a href="https://energyalliance.org/brazil/">helping</a> to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.  </p><p data-line-id="9d446d1c88e441b5916de1116299a0aa"> India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/this-battery-storage-fix-offers-a-blueprint-for-systems-level-solutions-110853">commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system</a> – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers. And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030. </p><p data-line-id="49a0740bed5649d68d265a6cde18f0fb"> Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach. But with <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/12-06-2024-progress-on-basic-energy-access-reverses-for-first-time-in-a-decade">685 million people</a> worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.  </p><p data-line-id="07d66246906c493591e5797a175eb737"> The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence. By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all. </p>

<p data-line-id="803af9d4ef1d492dbe147e74c7a22f01"> NEW YORK – Try putting yourself in <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>’s shoes. You could spend your days on what made you one of the world’s richest people while also deploying your wealth to do the most good. You could invest in for-profit ventures pursuing things like clean-energy breakthroughs, or in effecting changes in policy. And to mark your 70th birthday, you could publish an essay that would quickly become a global news story. </p><p data-line-id="8596414728b2426ebefbbac21e4c6cd5"> Gates has done it all. His essay, “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">Three Tough Truths About Climate</a>,” sent a shockwave through the climate movement on the eve of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil. But the essay is less blueprint than Rorschach test, because anyone can selectively quote from its 5,000 words to support a wide variety of viewpoints. </p><p data-line-id="037f7cd06aee4fbc9a3a071ae25f25fd"> Like many such documents, this one begins with a strawman. In a move more typical of the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based group founded on the premise that environmentalism harms the climate cause, Gates rejects the “doomsday” argument that “nothing matters more than limiting the rise in temperature.” Little does – but Gates chose to go with “nothing,” a much stronger word. </p><p data-line-id="9c4b22c37a5f4c189966267642b4665c"> He then argues that climate change, though a “serious” problem, “will not be the end of civilization.” But supercharged storms and other climate-driven disasters are already upending lives and livelihoods. Of the five recorded storms severe enough to warrant the proposed “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-hurricane-melissa-show-its-time-for-a-category-6-designation/">category 6</a>” classification, all have happened in the past 15 years. </p><p data-line-id="87fd6f8c7d8d48cb91d52d0368dd9521"> Moreover, we are not dealing only with massive, headline-grabbing extremes and <a href="http://www.gwagner.com/tipping-economics">global tipping points</a> (irreversible planetary changes). There are also the pernicious, often hidden “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691221038/slow-burn">slow burn</a>” effects, like the <a href="https://gwagner.com/hle">0.04% loss</a> in annual payroll for one additional day above 32°C (90°F) in any given year. Such costs add up quickly. To point out that we can still live with average global warming <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/investment-decarbonization-trillions-climate-costs">below 3°C</a> is hardly reassuring, especially for the poor and vulnerable who already suffer the most. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="afea525eb5294f3d822b61f71c73fcf4"> Gates’s reasoning on this socioeconomic dimension is understandable. His second and third tough truths focus on human suffering and prosperity, and these are indeed the criteria against which climate progress should be measured. Annual greenhouse-gas emissions, their atmospheric concentrations, the resulting warming, and effects like rising seas and more devastating storms are all ultimately proxies for lives that will be disrupted or even ended prematurely. </p><p data-line-id="a292d52f9fba402a8a6d3747c8200cb8"> Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24487-w">mortality cost of carbon</a>. Each ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century. </p><p data-line-id="5a84976b6fcd4877979596f787721a6e"> True, many people already die from other preventable causes. Gates himself has called out US President Donald Trump’s administration for cutting aid funding in ways that will <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">kill children</a> in some of the poorest parts of the world. In an effort to make up for some of the shortfall with his own foundation and personal wealth, Gates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-cuts.html">has reduced his giving</a> for climate programs and investments, both in the US and globally. </p><p data-line-id="19bd406446e94130b513ae094ed5cf3d"> No one doubts that there are only so many philanthropic dollars to go around. But climate finance goes well beyond charity, as Gates shows by his own actions. His own total <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/04/climate-bill-gates-memo">public health and climate funding have increased</a> over time. “Funding,” in this case, includes support for Breakthrough Energy (which has no relation to the Institute), which has invested in more than 150 companies that need help scaling up climate technologies by driving down the “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/introducing-the-green-premiums">green premium</a>” (the added costs of low-carbon technologies relative to high-carbon ones that pay nothing for their negative externalities). </p><p data-line-id="81f276dfe091491d8bb1569f5d093b2f"> Reducing this premium is necessary for many early-stage startups that have yet to climb the learning curve and benefit from economies of scale. Fortunately, there are plenty of other climate technologies that are already in the money. Solar power’s rapid growth over the past half-decade is the result of economics, not benevolence. The same goes for battery prices, which have <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/energy-storage">fallen by about 50%</a> since 2010. </p><p data-line-id="169ccd29f02242df87ebcd09e120ccb2"> While other low-carbon technologies still command a green premium, most are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/what-would-it-take-to-scale-critical-climate-technologies">trending toward profitability</a>. Still, we need creative thinking to help them get there. Co-production helps. A company focused on a single product might lose against incumbents, but spreading the green premium across two or more products can cut costs significantly. The Gates-funded company Brimstone, for example, focuses both on <a href="https://gwagner.com/ft-cement">producing lower-carbon cement</a> and on making money from the alumina extracted in the production process. <a href="http://gwagner.com/years-sublime">Sublime</a>, a rival cement startup, is pursuing a similar strategy. (I recently co-authored a <a href="https://gwagner.com/coproduction">study</a> with Brimstone’s CEO, Cody Finke, and a half-dozen colleagues, including an employee of another Gates-funded venture, on precisely this point.) </p><p data-line-id="2c7d9abc8948446092ad6d7a01f708b9"> Patience helps, too. Back when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was the governor of the Bank of England, he poignantly described the climate as a “<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability">tragedy of the horizon</a>.” Too many businesses feel compelled to focus on short-term earnings, just as political leaders are unable to think beyond election cycles. But some of Gates’s climate investments, like those in the <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/work/accelerate-energy-innovation/reader/the-future-of-energy-is-subatomic">next-generation nuclear</a> company TerraPower, and especially his investments in Commonwealth Fusion, are deliberately structured to yield returns years or even decades from now. </p><p data-line-id="77f97b353b024e5dafc93fc082fda226"> Supportive policies help, such as the explicit carbon prices and <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2040-climate-target_en">decarbonization targets</a> in the European Union, or the <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/one-big-beautiful-bill-setback-clean-energy">subsidies</a> that are more prominent in the United States. The key, in each case, is to provide long-term investment certainty. This is an area where Gates’s essay is especially weak. While Gates fully recognizes the importance of policy, he has created an opening for those, like Trump, who put their personal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/why-the-us-economy-might-benefit-from-abandoning-clean-energy-goals">short-term gain</a> first. </p><p data-line-id="fac84665a9fe48e18baf04b99c503c9b"> But make no mistake: the benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels far outweigh the costs. Gates clearly understands that. Clean energy is about <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165460">sovereignty, energy security, equity</a>, and, yes, future competitiveness. Ending reliance on oil, coal, and gas, and embracing technologies that will only become better and cheaper over time, is not just smart climate policy. It is the best way to improve economic competitiveness and human prosperity for decades to come. </p>

<p data-line-id="6822b0a9d9f645a1a67f6840fac66a1e"> LONDON – The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), now underway in Brazil, marks a decade since 195 parties adopted the landmark Paris climate agreement at COP21. But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/from-billions-to-trillions-setting-a-new-goal-on-climate-finance">trillions of dollars</a>, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing. </p><p data-line-id="eb5c4554993c48f687f8eec2e6367639"> The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks. </p><p data-line-id="34a307d24aa944879780748e1f49e5c4"> The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/promising-new-technologies-face-market-uncertainty-in-pivotal-moment-for-global-energy-innovation">warned</a> that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-state-of-energy-innovation/executive-summary">declined</a> across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="347f63bffcf34424a30931fef7c2d97b"> While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities. </p><p data-line-id="aab6bbd009b443d1b086186935f021bc"> From its very inception, the <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/">Council for Inclusive Capitalism</a> (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">call</a> to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/just-energy-transition-home/">just climate transition</a>. </p><p data-line-id="0d90eabba43c4ff3871d27960c3b7c93"> Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices. </p><p data-line-id="224c98979fbe4b58a23fb16b5d1ddef0"> Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/unga-80-climate-week-2025/">meeting</a> with World Bank President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-banga">Ajay Banga</a> at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind. </p><p data-line-id="4da1854df1b545a69996894d3be336b1"> Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/investing-in-climate-for-growth-and-development_16b7cbc7-en.html">joint report</a> by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="ca81660fb7824eef8ccf5fa2e463447b"> Other emerging markets are also <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">making strides</a>. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s <a href="https://etedge-insights.com/industry/energy/india-takes-giant-leap-to-become-worlds-second-largest-renewable-energy-market-by-2030-iea-report/">second-largest renewable-energy market</a> after China. For developing countries, <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/news-insights/2025-steering-committee-meeting/">inclusive growth</a> is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="93976b0f0a5b4a96b0bd7bd9aef4936c"> Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s industrial and climate policies were already <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c">experiencing delays</a> even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32r5k43vwo">jeopardizing</a> the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms. </p><p data-line-id="5dcac16330fb42a392b930c20a72a6cc"> Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs. </p><p data-line-id="9ffd97bb64624c649d91c194eee16faf"> The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet. </p>
