    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="c7690e5fefe94c9a9335add806272ef0"> ITHACA, NEW YORK – As the dust settles after one of the most turbulent presidential elections in American history, many are questioning whether President-elect Donald Trump will deliver on his economic agenda and – assuming he follows through on his campaign promises – what impact his policies will have on the United States and the rest of the world. </p><p data-line-id="10a1f353bb8f4007ba1f1fe338899126"> On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly pledged to create manufacturing jobs by imposing a <a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/2024/why-trumps-tariff-proposals-would-harm-working-americans">10% tariff</a> on all imports and up to 60% on Chinese goods. He also vowed to punish American companies that produce goods overseas, deport <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan">millions</a> of undocumented immigrants, and make it harder for migrants to enter the country and compete with American workers. </p><p data-line-id="878d2ecccb1c4124a2d5e758cc57dffd"> At first glance, Trump’s vision of a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/14/trump-manufacturing-jobs-china-globalization/">manufacturing renaissance</a>” may seem appealing. Given the election’s outcome, it has clearly resonated with voters. Financial markets also reacted positively: after the election was called, the dollar <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/dollar-one-year-high-trump-trade-momentum-eclipses-fed-easing-view-2024-11-14/">rose</a> against most major currencies, and the S&amp;P 500 recorded its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/sp-500-futures-cross-6000-mark-equities-ride-higher-trumps-victory-2024-11-08/">largest weekly gain</a> in a year. </p><p data-line-id="24f9da36a03948d8b885fcf3aef5e8e0"> But the reality is not as rosy as it may seem. The stock-market rally is primarily driven by expectations of significant tax cuts and deregulation. Plans to raise taxes on the super-rich and large corporations – a <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf">centerpiece</a> of Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign – will be shelved, at least for now. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="7b64e2d4140340ea83b13f1fc59010ba"> When it comes to Trump’s plans to restrict the flow of goods and people, experts remain far less optimistic. A <a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/2024/why-trumps-tariff-proposals-would-harm-working-americans">recent Peterson Institute paper</a> by Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely examines the potential consequences of Trump’s proposed trade barriers, warning that his import tariffs will lead to higher prices, with the burden falling disproportionately on low- and middle-income households. </p><p data-line-id="d8615ce5d32f4b328eda75ea87be92c8"> To be sure, some may argue that Trump’s tariffs will not result in sustained inflation, just a one-time price spike. According to this view, the long-term benefits would outweigh the short-term costs. </p><p data-line-id="7a9d74b00cad4c62b93901749e4f293b"> But there is reason to believe that instead of delivering lasting economic gains, the trade policies Trump favors would cause serious damage. This is because, although consumers would undoubtedly shoulder much of the burden, they are only part of the story. A tariff wall around the US would raise costs for domestic producers – an outcome that would hardly come as a shock to anyone but Trump. </p><p data-line-id="e6fc047707ec4072944f42c35dedabeb"> The fundamental flaw in Trump’s tariff plan is that domestic producers rely heavily on imported inputs. Consider steel: the US, the <a href="https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/imports-us.pdf">world’s largest steel importer</a>, sources its supplies from 80 countries, including Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and China. A sharp increase in steel tariffs would thus drive up the cost of American-made products, erode the country’s economic competitiveness, and ultimately undermine Trump’s stated goal of bringing back manufacturing jobs. </p><p data-line-id="5b443a000a7b4166b230082717771ed2"> Trump’s plan to limit the use of foreign labor would exacerbate the problem. India, for example, has been one of the largest providers of labor to the US since India’s 1991 economic reforms. Over the past three decades, outsourcing has been a boon for both India and the US, as the digital revolution enabled American companies to take advantage of India’s lower labor costs. </p><p data-line-id="439c0f83b24f410eb7eb9d1b0137157c"> Restricting outsourcing in the name of protecting American workers will not only hurt India’s economy but also increase production costs in the US. In addition to reduced competitiveness, Trump’s proposed restrictions could have far-reaching geopolitical consequences, potentially undermining three decades of US diplomatic efforts to forge closer security ties with India. </p><p data-line-id="f5a53d4628534ded8ecee9cb9754bbeb"> Moreover, restricting access to cheap foreign labor would enable other countries, especially China, to outcompete American firms in the product market. As the US increasingly isolates itself, China is busy expanding its foothold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Its growing presence in these regions could open new avenues for production and sourcing, boosting Chinese productivity and enhancing its geopolitical clout. </p><p data-line-id="e8226bf240dc4308ac06e1bb2b162a99"> While the debate about outsourcing in the US is often framed as a simple conflict between American and foreign workers, what is often overlooked is that outsourcing pushes up corporate profits. The solution lies not in restricting access to lower-cost overseas labor but in using taxation to redistribute some of the gains from the rich to the poor, ensuring that the benefits of global trade are shared more equitably. </p><p data-line-id="a3f34a98942647c7acb454c50f5f9a01"> In most democracies, the primary concern following an election is that the winners will fail to deliver on their campaign promises. The 2024 US presidential election is one of those rare instances where there is palpable fear – in America and around the world – that the winner will actually follow through. </p>

<p data-line-id="639ab533430b4dec90e9dbb7aa5e7ed4"> ATHENS – Last month’s BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, was, like all summits, heavy on photo ops. And it yielded a second act that was similarly heavier on symbolism than substance: the release of a <a href="https://yakovpartners.ru/upload/iblock/9c2/ci594n0ysocxuukw7iliw6qtr4xz6cc4/BRICS_Research_on_IMFS.pdf">report</a> by the Russian finance ministry and central bank on “improvement of the international monetary and financial system,” by which Russian officials obviously meant “finding an alternative to the weaponized dollar.” </p>

<p data-line-id="f39bc1c1535e4e13a5e882c53b93c16c"> CAMBRIDGE – “It’s the economy, stupid!” This famous mantra, coined by the political strategist James Carville, helped Bill Clinton unseat President George H.W. Bush in 1992, and now it explains another election. The economy played a critical role in the 2024 presidential race, creating the conditions not only for Donald Trump to trounce Kamala Harris, and for the Republicans to gain <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/elections/republican-house-trifecta.html">control</a> of the Senate and the House of Representatives, but possibly also for a counter-elite to usher in a new power structure. </p>

<p data-line-id="177ffae78466405c91e8bc288e0e6725"> WASHINGTON, DC – Donald Trump’s victory in last week’s US presidential election has left many world leaders feeling dejected. European leaders fear that he will browbeat them on issues ranging from trade to defense spending, while those in Latin America are terrified that he will punish them for immigration flows. In the Middle East, however, the reaction has been more mixed. Some leaders are crestfallen, others elated. But those who are cheering now may be pining for a less capricious leader once Trump takes office. </p>

For Harris, though, we will see a disastrous decline from the 81.2 million votes that Joe Biden received, and this despite the fact that the voting-eligible population has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections">increased by four million</a>. </p>

calls for COP29 to address the overlooked question of how to channel funds to vulnerable communities.        </p>
</header>
</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="4bbc26b6515e442ba8d66c9a20a969ec"> WASHINGTON, DC – At the top of the list of measures to be agreed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, is the <a href="https://unfccc.int/NCQG">New Collective Quantified Goal</a> (NCQG) on climate finance, which will support climate action in developing countries after 2025. The main concern will be setting contribution targets for developed countries. But another crucial question has been overlooked: <em>who</em> will have access to these funds? </p>
<p data-line-id="b695d978dfa44ec8b830f28a9963c5e7"> Not nearly enough climate finance has reached low-income communities in the world’s most vulnerable countries. These are the places that are disproportionately affected by global warming, despite contributing the least to causing the problem. An estimated <a href="https://www.unsgsa.org/publications/8-billion-reasons-inclusive-finance-catalyst-climate-action">75% of the $4.8 trillion</a> that has been channeled into climate action over the past decade has been invested in high-income countries. Between 2003 and 2016, <a href="https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/10178IIED.pdf">less than 10%</a> of international, regional, and national climate funds flowed to local actors. </p>
<p data-line-id="a91ff3ae0c8b40e5a2516ec62f004f19"> This must change. Many of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/climate-change">3.3 billion people</a> who live in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change do not have the resources they need to protect themselves, their families, or their livelihoods. And providing climate finance to low-income households and businesses has well-known benefits: they can recover more quickly from weather shocks; diversify their income-generating activities; and invest in the green technologies needed to build resilience and advance the energy transition. While agreeing a new climate-finance target is a critical first step toward securing funding, addressing how to channel more of it to local communities must be a central part of the conversation at COP29, and on the road to <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/events/2025-un-climate-change-conference-unfccc-cop-30/">COP30</a> in Belém, Brazil, too. </p>
<p data-line-id="ba477184047844b793e9ad3e7d70bd82"> One possible solution is to develop more inclusive financial services. Over recent decades, an ecosystem of investors, regulators, and financial institutions has evolved to take large-scale funding and deliver it in small-ticket financing to low-income households while managing risk. Equally important, these institutions have billions of long-term customers in climate-vulnerable countries and communities. They have built relationships with these people and understand their needs and how best to serve them. From that foundation, it is possible to create products that will effectively boost climate adaptation and resilience. </p>
<div class="textwidget textwidget--inherited" data-line-id="5ad5c91aa4d7461d8e158b875969c1b9" id="article-widget"></div>
<p data-line-id="855cf5f14e9f4c26b2d512a0ff0376f5"> Many innovative programs have already been implemented. <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/innovative-solutions-for-adapting-to-heat-must-be-scaled-up-by-jess-ayers-1-and-helen-mountford-2024-09">Low-cost heat-wave insurance</a> protects hundreds of thousands of poor women in India against soaring temperatures. Contingent <a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/8-billion-reasons-inclusive-finance-catalyst-for-climate-action">credit lines</a> help farmers in Bangladesh manage flood risks. And thanks to a <a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/8-billion-reasons-inclusive-finance-catalyst-for-climate-action">mobile layaway product</a>, smallholder farmers in Mali, Senegal, and Tanzania can pay in installments for climate-smart inputs and sustainable-agriculture training programs. </p>
<p data-line-id="ced49964f3fa408399a62dc5bd22b488"> In addition to bolstering climate adaptation and resilience, inclusive financial products and services can help drive investment in mitigation and contribute to a just green transition. In Bangladesh, for example, electric-cookstove manufacturer ATEC has deployed a <a href="https://mecs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MECS-ATEC-Cook-to-Earn-Pilot-Project-Report-2023-v1.0.docx.pdf">cook-to-earn model</a>, which involves paying customers shares of ATEC’s revenue from the sale of carbon credits, based on customers’ usage data. By incentivizing people to adopt and continue using this green technology, they are creating a virtuous cycle. </p>
<p data-line-id="e111910922e24b6ba2faa1096bc9c359"> Wide adoption of such nascent initiatives could accelerate climate action at the grassroots level. Ensuring that low-income and otherwise disadvantaged people can access the funding provided by developed countries would promote resilience to extreme weather and transform the fight against global warming. Inclusive finance could also help alleviate the global climate-finance gap, because the sector has a proven track record in mobilizing private capital for development projects. What was an NGO-driven and grant-oriented sector 30 years ago is now a massive commercial industry. </p>
<p data-line-id="41a35463b6984ff0b46731f9f5a261fe"> To achieve global climate goals, we can no longer ignore the people most exposed to the dire consequences of rising temperatures. The NCQG, while important and necessary, is only the starting point. As developed countries set new climate-finance targets at COP29, they must also make a more concerted effort to ensure that this funding reaches those who need it the most. Inclusive finance is an obvious part of the solution that could achieve so much more than it is today. </p>

Deaths are expected to increase from 5.4 million to 10.5 million per year during the same period, with two demographic groups – men aged 65 and above, and men in low- and middle-income countries – facing the biggest increases. In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, male cancer deaths could reach one million annually, driven by factors like limited health-care access and lack of screening services, which contribute to late-stage diagnoses. </p>

<p data-line-id="4c92d04a2f4d432ea51f1bcccbb011f8"> BOGOTÁ – The ocean is our greatest natural resource. It provides <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-oxygen.html">half</a> the planet’s oxygen, helps to feed <a href="https://www.un.org/en/desa/5-reasons-you-should-care-about-our-ocean">half</a> the world’s people, and, as the world’s largest carbon sink, is one of our best defenses against climate change. But it is under attack like never before. </p>
<p data-line-id="cf3de5d644d04e3d82debc77817e87e1"> Sea surface temperatures are <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ocean-hotter-ever-heres-why">hotter than ever</a>, which is killing marine life and fueling stronger hurricanes. Many big-fish populations have been decimated. Half of all coral reefs – which serve as essential habitats for marine life and as vital coastal defenses – have been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-planet-has-lost-half-of-coral-reefs-since-1950-180978701/">destroyed</a>. This sustained degradation of the ocean is threatening human life around the world. Stopping it is essential, and the good news is that a framework for doing so is already in place. </p>
<p data-line-id="de425484c0e945e4866f3811579e4c33"> Two years ago, the world adopted the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets">Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</a>, which set a target of protecting and conserving at least 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030. Then, at the COP16 United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Cali, Colombia, last month, representatives from governments around the world <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop16-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-biodiversity-conference-in-cali-colombia/">took stock</a> of the progress made so far. What stood out is that the host country is an example both of what is possible and of how much work remains to be done. </p>
<p data-line-id="b45d48321ba04816be262bbe1b1a0a12"> Over the past decade, Colombia has emerged as a global leader in conservation, and for good reason. Colombia is one of the world’s most biodiverse countries, and, as one of only two South American countries with Pacific and Atlantic <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-countries-have-coastlines-on-both-the-atlantic-and-the-pacific-oceans.html">coastlines</a>, its future is inextricably linked to the bodies of water that surround it. In 2022, the government <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/03/colombia-protected-ocean">announced</a> that it had protected 30% of its ocean area, making Colombia the first country in the Western Hemisphere to do so – and prompting other Latin American countries to follow its lead. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="cbde0ea91fbb41aa88ae17d96e6381da"> A <a href="https://for-the-ocean.org/resources/">new report</a> commissioned by Bloomberg Philanthropies through the Bloomberg Ocean Fund, and developed in partnership with other major marine-conservation organizations, shows that Latin America is now leading the way on global marine protection. Around 26% of the maritime area surrounding Latin America and the Caribbean is now under some form of marine conservation protection – higher than any other region in the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="4acb871962574037a30008a17b4901b2"> But this statistic only reflects the coverage of official marine protected areas. It does not tell us what is going on underwater. There, unfortunately, the data are much less promising. Only 2.5% of the region’s ocean, and a mere 1.5% of Colombia’s maritime area, appears to be getting the level of protection necessary to conserve marine life. </p>
<p data-line-id="0b7b1b2e7c9449259d8f95c6e299e4b7"> The picture is even bleaker in the rest of the world. The United Kingdom, for example, designates 47% of its domestic waters (excluding Overseas Territories) as marine protected areas, but less than 1% have been assessed as effectively protected. Japan, meanwhile, has designated 7.3% of its domestic waters as marine protected areas, with 0% assessed as effectively protected. </p>
<p data-line-id="292ba3f7df1044c0a22a89aa79b9dbaf"> The ocean can continue protecting and feeding the world only if governments deliver on their commitments to protect it. Recognizing the need for an urgent change in course, the Bloomberg Ocean Fund report lays out a series of crucial next steps to help governments effectively protect 30% of their ocean areas by 2030. But, as Mike Bloomberg likes to say: If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. </p>
<p data-line-id="3d27cbd7ee8648f5a3d6d0533520ee14"> Increased data collection is therefore essential. With more actionable information at their disposal, countries can better track their progress, and key stakeholders – not least local coastal communities – can participate more fully in conservation efforts. For that, we need to get tools that have proven invaluable for fostering transparency and accountability, such as SkyTruth’s <a href="https://skytruth.org/30x30/">30x30 Progress Tracker</a>, into more people’s hands. </p>
<p data-line-id="fd91eb735e4d46ddb1d43106aaf17c18"> The report also urges wealthy countries to deliver on their promises. In 2022, Global North governments <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/yamide-dagnet/biodiversity-cop16-climate-cop29-building-equitable-accountability-alignment">committed</a> to increase funding for developing countries to at least $20 billion per year by 2025, and to $30 billion by 2030. However, little of this funding has been delivered. While the recently announced <a href="https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/press-releases/boost-nature-governments-announce-163-million-new-pledges-global">$163 million</a> in new pledges from donor countries is welcome, such sums are a drop in the bucket. Far more funding is desperately needed to support conservation efforts across Latin America and other regions, especially in the Global South. And it should go without saying that promised financing should be delivered in a timely fashion. </p>
<p data-line-id="9768564c2fe249089fa046093550ab31"> With the COP16 negotiations now <a href="https://www.wri.org/news/statement-cop16-biodiversity-summit-concludes-some-progress-major-work-remains">paused</a> until a later date, the stakes for getting this right couldn’t be higher. Billions of lives depend on urgent global action to protect the ocean. It is imperative that more countries move aggressively to adopt ambitious pledges – and the concrete policies and practices needed to fulfill them. </p>

<p data-line-id="f02462e93f624313a5226bb7ad9a7596"> NEW YORK – Donald Trump’s resounding victory in last week’s US presidential election should not have come as a shock to anyone. The 45th and 47th president rode an unprecedentedly strong anti-incumbency wave that has severely <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">punished</a> almost every governing party around the world at the ballot box this year. In fact, Vice President Kamala Harris was among the <em>best </em>performers of all “incumbents” who faced elections in rich countries this year – a testament to her disciplined campaign, Trump’s historically unpopular candidacy, and America’s world-beating economy. </p>

<p data-line-id="7140e7f5785e4e1f9f3f0265b921a508"> WARSAW – Before the US presidential election, it seemed like no one but Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters believed he could win. After all, the man is a convicted felon, a putschist-provocateur, an agent of chaos, and a walking scandal who has been disowned by almost all his former advisers, some of whom describe him as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html">fascist</a>. Moreover, the incumbent Democratic administration presides over an economy with low inflation, low unemployment, high economic growth, a record-high stock market, and major new investments in infrastructure, technology, and green energy. Yet it happened. </p>

<p data-line-id="d01f32f7b0734580ad3923409f1d451a"> BAKU – Our world is at a critical juncture. The devastating effects of global warming are increasingly evident, and the crisis is deepening. To mitigate it, we must urgently reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions. Failing to act now will only increase the human and economic toll. </p><p data-line-id="27b234c2637543fbb15980835b221a04"> The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, presents a unique opportunity for effective collective action. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and global uncertainty, COP29 will serve as a test of the multilateral system on which humanity’s ability to respond to this existential threat depends. </p><p data-line-id="9b9cdcd4fb194ed68f7d5c92caa0abdc"> The groundwork for coordinated action was laid in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 with the creation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which established the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to promote consensus-based solutions. The philosophy was simple: given that climate change is a global issue, addressing it requires a collaborative approach. </p><p data-line-id="fe4ed2d4a48d4d61a528c1f9a046eb85"> The UNFCCC fosters cooperation between smaller countries and superpowers, enables civil-society organizations to engage directly with governments, and facilitates cross-border technology transfers. Perhaps most importantly, it provides a framework for collective action in which each country’s efforts encourage others to step up their own. </p><p data-line-id="fe13718ba130402b9977e60358f0fe90"> While the 1997 Kyoto Protocol set binding emission-reduction targets for developed economies, it quickly became clear that more was needed. In response, developed countries pledged in 2009 to <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html">mobilize $100 billion</a> annually by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate policies. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="dbb4f5056c364e808f04fb92834c2202"> The 2015 Paris climate agreement marked a turning point, setting the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels and ensuring that the increase stays well below 2°C. To monitor progress, the agreement established a system of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) through which each country outlines its emission-reduction plans. Periodic global audits assess whether countries are on track to fulfill their climate commitments. </p><p data-line-id="7c2185daab694454aaf1bd5f482198a8"> Regrettably, the <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">first global audit</a>, released ahead of last year’s COP28 in Dubai, showed that we are far from meeting these climate targets. It also offered a comprehensive roadmap, calling on all countries to commit to NDCs aligned with the 1.5°C goal and establishing clear steps and timelines – including transitioning away from fossil fuels – that could bring the Paris agreement’s objectives within reach. </p><p data-line-id="87f490d8287041e291cc3a10740e342e"> COP29 represents the next step for the multilateral approach, with leaders expected to agree on a significant boost to the $100 billion climate finance target – the so-called <a href="https://unfccc.int/NCQG">New Collective Quantified Goal</a> (NCQG). Moreover, each country must submit its updated NDCs by February 2025. </p><p data-line-id="94da3c71aea74f44a7f5c9649233784e"> Transparency is essential to this process. If the Paris agreement’s targets are the destination, and the NDCs are the roadmap, the NCQG provides the fuel needed to get there. Building trust in countries’ commitment to bold climate action and willingness to provide the necessary financing is key. </p><p data-line-id="ae12334a8cca47e6b1a3dc008d914bde"> As COP29 President, Azerbaijan is urging all countries to submit NDCs aligned with the 1.5°C target as soon as possible. We are also doing everything we can to secure a fair and ambitious new climate-finance goal that addresses developing countries’ needs and matches the scale and urgency of the crisis. </p><p data-line-id="00ef4773b49a447a9b33daeecbe70c20"> Falling short would force us to confront tough questions: Are we willing to accept the failure of the Paris agreement? And what are the alternatives? One thing is clear: without a viable backup plan, we must do all we can to meet the 1.5°C goal. Sleepwalking into climate catastrophe is not an option. </p><p data-line-id="58e3043142af457c8fe52b2628801e9a"> To be sure, the multilateral system has its flaws. But it remains the best framework to tackle this daunting challenge. Over three decades, it has fostered lasting international cooperation, a shared understanding of the science, and a strong consensus concerning global climate goals. </p><p data-line-id="a9961f7b0b994bedaf59a81238ef286c"> The alternative to multilateralism is a fragmented response, with governments pursuing their own agendas without coordination or cooperation. This approach would mean slower progress, higher costs, and less equitable outcomes. Without a unifying goal, any sense of shared purpose would all but vanish. </p><p data-line-id="c8992f5ee3ec4ab894d7b7cd5dee6325"> Consider, for example, COP29’s objective of finalizing negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris agreement, which aims to standardize carbon markets. By channeling resources toward the most effective mitigation projects, this framework could save <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news1/2019/9/24/effective-article-6-trading-rules-could-save-up-to-250-billionyr-for-climate-action-by-2030-study-finds">$250 billion</a> annually by 2030 – a substantial boost in an era of limited resources. </p><p data-line-id="92a89ebccd8142a78d0e57c0ccb6e0f9"> Given the alternatives, we have no choice but to make the current system work. The COP29 Presidency will leave no stone unturned to achieve an international consensus. With an agenda focused on advancing transformative climate action, Azerbaijan could help bridge geopolitical divisions. But our success hinges on countries’ willingness to engage constructively and commit to the multilateral process. </p><p data-line-id="6ef48dcf87a8467ca8316b6967bc46ba"> The science is clear, the frameworks for coordinated action are in place, and the plan has been laid out. Now, we must find the political will to put these tools to use. COP29 is our chance to prove that multilateralism can work. </p>

<p data-line-id="b9717672d5a24e11ad2f8a45ca931b52"> CAMBRIDGE – China’s rise has challenged America’s undisputed hegemony over the world economy – a status the United States has enjoyed since the Soviet Union’s collapse. While some American national-security elites seek continued US primacy, others seem resigned to an increasingly bipolar world. A more likely outcome, however, is a multipolar world where middle powers exert considerable countervailing force, thus preventing the US and China from imposing their interests on others. </p>

<p data-line-id="ddeb21c3f5bc4445ae926cceb85fd068"> NEW YORK – Elections are supposed to clarify policy uncertainties, and on the economic front, Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris has done just that. All three major US stock indices and US Treasury yields <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-11-06-2024-2cb248af">jumped</a> the morning after Election Day, reflecting expectations of both strong economic growth and soaring debt and inflation. </p>
<p data-line-id="f74903fdfbd2484bbacde5ab65dda79a"> On climate and (especially) environmental policy, another Trump presidency is clearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/climate/2024-election-climate-change.html">bad news</a>, and it is exacerbated by extreme policy uncertainty and decidedly mixed signals, especially in cases where Trump may try to stand in the way of larger technological and market trends. </p>
<p data-line-id="695bc6be65b04f648ba75f21abdfcca0"> Consider electric vehicles (EVs). Casting himself as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99vlpkzk4no">champion</a> of the internal combustion engine, Trump says he will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-19/trump-vows-action-to-end-electric-vehicle-mandate-on-day-one">eliminate</a> tailpipe-emissions rules on “day one.” Doing so will be well within his power, and it may provide some life support for a waning industry. At the same time, Tesla’s stock <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-musk-trump-election-rivian-1086ba9f">jumped 15%</a> on the election news, with investors clearly betting the company will benefit from its CEO, Elon Musk, having spent more than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-wins-big-with-trump-bet-3c61ad90">$100 million</a> of his own money to help elect Trump. </p>
<p data-line-id="90dda231604747399351d2fffe59b514"> All this is happening at a time when EVs are demonstrating their fundamental superiority to the technology that has preceded them. EVs <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/01/electric-vehicles-use-half-the-energy-of-gas-powered-vehicles/">convert 90%</a> of their power into distance traveled, compared to only 20% for gasoline-powered vehicles. While the full efficiency gain depends on how much of the electricity is derived from renewables, even coal-fired power plants are more efficient than an internal combustion engine. In West Virginia, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html">around 90%</a> of power comes from coal, an EV cuts carbon pollution by <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/09/electric-vehicles-reduce-carbon-pollution-in-all-u-s-states/">around 30%</a>. The US average efficiency gain is already around 50%, and rising. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="730f0dd806934bef84e50038d1813834"> Thus, basis physics dictates that any attempt by Trump to stand in the way of the EV transition is bound to fail. That said, he can still do a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/2024-us-election-what-trump-victory-would-mean-for-climate-energy-economic-security-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2024-09">lot of damage</a> along the way, especially when it comes to US competitiveness. US automakers already face stiff competition from China and elsewhere, and no US policy reversal on EVs or other clean technologies will curtail the rest of the world’s green industrial expansion. </p>
<p data-line-id="c12722b7184b431db9246a8ca101b5c6"> Already, over half of newly registered cars in China are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/more-than-half-of-new-cars-sold-in-china-are-now-electric-or-hybrid.html">EVs or plug-in hybrids</a> – more than twice the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars">global average</a>. The US is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales">laggard</a>, and Trump’s victory all but ensures that it will remain one for some time to come. Imposing 10-20% <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariffs-would-hurt-business-and-workers-by-maurice-obstfeld-2024-10">tariffs on all imports</a>, and a 60% <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/economic-arguments-tariffs-trump/680015/">tariff on Chinese goods</a>, will not protect domestic manufacturers, as he claims. Trump already <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-officials-weigh-25-percent-tax-on-imported-cars-in-a-bid-to-force-concessions-in-nafta-trade-talks/2018/05/23/76e72172-5eca-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html">levied</a> a 25% tariff during his first presidency, and it did nothing to help US automakers prepare for the electric future; neither did the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/opinion/biden-china-trade-electric-vehicles-solar-panels-tariffs.html">100% tariffs</a> on Chinese EVs. </p>
<p data-line-id="644fd97d37a9405792b069da08d2a6b8"> Trump’s efforts to halt the low-carbon transition may be even more futile when it comes to solar, wind, and other low-carbon technologies. Here, too, China dominates the global market, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-technology-perspectives-2024">producing</a> 97% of solar wafers, 85% of solar cells, and 80% of solar modules. That is why the Biden administration tried, with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA), to onshore some of the renewables supply chain by subsidizing domestic manufacturing. This resulted in projects like <a href="https://illuminateusa.com/press/a-new-era-of-manufacturing-pataskalas-illuminate-usa-starts-solar-panel-production/">Illuminate USA</a>, a joint venture with Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi in Pataskala, Ohio. The plant is expected to <a href="https://illuminateusa.com/press/pataskalas-massive-illuminate-usa-solar-plant-to-make-1000-panels-an-hour-when-complete/">assemble</a> more than nine million solar panels per year, enough to power a million American homes. </p>
<p data-line-id="0663a42e233747e399c85e9b8ed9ab9a"> The Trump administration may well want to continue the IRA’s production tax credit, which subsidizes around 25% of Illuminate’s costs. Either way, Trump’s approach will have implications mainly for the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/illuminate-usa-celebrates-one-thousand-illuminators-and-one-million-solar-panels-in-less-than-one-year-302218228.html">1,000 Ohioans</a> now employed by the plant. The effect on the global solar-panel market will be negligible; LONGi will simply find ways to manufacture the panels more cheaply elsewhere if it needs to. </p>
<p data-line-id="ddc7b00e7fa8465a8fb0744d62cbc258"> Of course, Trump can and will stand in the way of deploying renewables domestically as well. He has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-offshore-wind-execs-fret-privately-over-possible-trump-election-win-2024-10-31/">said</a> that he will <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-reelection-clean-energy-offshore-wind-inflation-reduction-act/732161/">halt offshore wind leases</a>; shares of wind developer Ørsted and turbine producer Vestas <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/european-clean-energy-stocks-tumble-trump-wins-presidency-2024-11-06/">lost</a> almost as much on the election news as Tesla gained. The Trump administration will also make it more difficult to connect new renewables to the grid, and try to extend the life of aging fossil-fuel infrastructure, while handing money to vested interests. But such tactics would merely delay the inevitable. </p>
<p data-line-id="0f365ea5f14946ddaa98ada9763c53ae"> During his first administration, Trump tried to revive the domestic coal sector. He failed. Coal had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/climate/trump-coal-politics.html">on its way out</a> long before he came to office, and the industry’s decline has only accelerated since then. The shift has been led by states like Texas, which recently <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/chart-whos-the-leader-in-utility-scale-solar-california-or-texas">surpassed</a> California in total utility-scale solar power installed. </p>
<p data-line-id="f1009b99d2ea427caa822d1b80b2765e"> Yes, Trump can and will do plenty of damage, including to public health through the rollback of environmental rules and safeguards. During his previous term, he rolled back <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-election-what-would-it-mean-for-climate-change-by-gernot-wagner-2024-03">more than 125</a> such rules, most of which were re-established under Biden. This time, he will be more ruthless and effective in ensuring that his reversals stick. In 2019, an <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32545-9/abstract">estimated 22,000 extra US deaths</a> were attributable to higher levels of local air pollution; such figures will become our new normal. </p>
<p data-line-id="53cadb9bb31840b4ab1175d3e5ab0473"> But Biden repaired the damage that Trump caused on the climate front, and then went further. The outgoing administration’s climate policies were even more ambitious than what US Senator Bernie Sanders proposed in his 2016 presidential platform. Biden’s strategy, anchored by the IRA, jump-started the green-tech race in the United States. Trump can and will handicap domestic industries in jockeying for positions in that global competition, but he cannot halt it. </p>

<p data-line-id="8998bead46474baeb6dd138bb3dae04d"> BAKU – From Bridgetown to Nairobi to Paris, no country is immune to the worsening effects of the climate crisis. With each passing year, we witness more climate-related destruction. In 2024, we have set a number of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biae087/7808595">new records</a>: wildfires in Chile have destroyed more than 14,000 homes; extreme rainfall in Brazil has devastated 478 cities and left nearly two million people stranded in Bangladesh; and in July the world experienced its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/24/record-hottest-day-earth-temperature-july">hottest day ever</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="372afc0660a44ca49792aa861d10e97a"> Africa has contributed only 3% of historical greenhouse-gas emissions, yet it endures some of the most severe climate-related disasters. These now cost the continent <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/cop28/focus-africa">$15 billion</a> per year, with climate-induced droughts and floods in 2023 causing food insecurity for more than 40 million Africans. </p>
<p data-line-id="fa396aefb4e9419ba1852acd43d7e0fe"> Convinced that no country should have to choose between fighting the climate crisis and combating poverty, we have decided to contribute to an ambitious reform of the international financial architecture. The <a href="https://pactedeparis.org/en.php">Paris Pact for People and the Planet</a>, the <a href="https://www.bridgetown-initiative.org/">Bridgetown Initiative</a>, and the <a href="https://www.afdb.org/sites/default/files/2023/09/08/the_african_leaders_nairobi_declaration_on_climate_change-rev-eng.pdf">Nairobi Declaration</a> each seek to provide one piece of the puzzle. Current international dynamics give us hope: many reform tracks have been opened up, and some have delivered results. That said, many more efforts are needed, and no options should be overlooked. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c2ade8b3ad24185aa4f61b382b60672"> One key piece is still underused: “solidarity levies.” Such policies are necessary to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to what should be a global effort. There are swaths of the economy which are largely under-taxed yet polluting the planet. This applies to maritime shipping, aviation, and, of course, the fossil-fuel industry, which enjoys low effective tax rates due to government subsidies (totaling an estimated <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2023/169/article-A001-en.xml">$7 trillion</a> in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund). </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="d118a1c6c52d4484aa5518d9227e03fd"> These levies can contribute by allocating a share of the revenues to developing countries. A global levy of 0.1% on stock and bond trades could raise up to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3407855">$418 billion</a> per year. A levy on shipping of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide could raise <a href="https://www.iddri.org/sites/default/files/PDF/Publications/Catalogue%20Iddri/Autre%20Publication/202306-Note-shipping%20levy.pdf">$80 billion</a> per year. A levy on fossil-fuel extraction of $5 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> could raise <a href="https://www.stampoutpoverty.org/live2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CDT_guide_web23.pdf">$210 billion</a> per year. Even a partial redistribution through solidarity levies would guarantee a large source of predictable climate finance for these countries, thus complementing flows of official development assistance without amplifying existing debt burdens. </p>
<p data-line-id="413a5115b1604206b1ca259613476980"> The benefits would be significant. Despite Africa’s climate vulnerability, its vast potential to leverage renewable energy and critical minerals, and its role as a global carbon sink, the continent receives far less climate finance than <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/actualites/closing-25-trillion-climate-gap-africa">it needs</a>. Solidarity levies could provide the funding needed to drive green development in Africa and around the world, especially in vulnerable low- and middle-income countries and small states with little fiscal room for building resilience or climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="a8bf6caa73164d4ab8e54c4558047aed"> These levies already exist. More than <a href="https://shs.hal.science/halshs-04087507/file/23009R_english.pdf">30 countries</a> currently implement a financial transaction tax, and at least 21 have a levy on airplane tickets. Moreover, even small-scale initiatives such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds demonstrate the feasibility of an international redistribution mechanism. To replicate and scale up these models requires further international cooperation to limit market distortions and preserve a level playing field. </p>
<p data-line-id="b0a89f7e64374e98ac1d1f604b6ae9a4"> To that end, we launched the <a href="https://globalsolidaritylevies.org/">Global Solidarity Levies Task Force</a> last year at COP28. With 13 member countries already, the task force has been examining the potential of levies across shipping, aviation, fossil fuels, and financial transactions, as well as exploring options like levies on plastic or cryptocurrency. In early 2025, we will publicly launch a handful of concrete proposals with rigorous impact assessments. These will be scalable – raising at least $100 billion per year – and accompanied by clear assessments of potential externalities.  </p>
<p data-line-id="6dbe5a71cf544bc88fda9cfe85fb1209"> As we head toward COP30 in Belém, Brazil, next year, political leadership will be essential to the initiative’s success. COP29 this month will provide the right opportunity to discuss our options and get on track for success. Our plan is to hold a special event for heads of state and government to marshal further support for our solidarity-levies coalition. This is a crucial opportunity to ensure that the United Nations’ <a href="https://unfccc.int/NCQG">New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance</a> incorporates solidarity levies and unlocks climate-finance flows that are both ambitious and equitable.  </p>
<p data-line-id="5307c2568c544dd98d2ad5f9b1370d2c"> When it comes to additional sources of finance, experts often allude to “innovative finance.” In the case of global solidarity levies, the only innovation required is ambitious leadership across a sufficient base of countries. Let the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement next year be remembered as the moment when we came together as a global community to implement solidarity levies, providing the financial tools necessary to meet the great challenge of our time. Ahead of COP29, we call on all governments to join our coalition, and we welcome the support of civil society, business leaders, and multilateral institutions. </p>

<p data-line-id="1684f44f8bee4505b2d99c050178c80e"> After the 2020 US election, it took days for major news networks to project the winner of the presidential race, and many more weeks for Americans – and the world – to know if there would be a peaceful and orderly transition of power. There wasn’t.

They chose the latter.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3175763f47e846c1b36762a9a8e52f9b"> Of course, many who voted for Trump would say that they based their decision on his promise to bring down the price of eggs; because there are too many illegal immigrants in America; or because cities are overrun with crime and homeless people. But make no mistake: Trump’s campaign was a rehearsal for autocracy, featuring praise for foreign dictators as models of leadership, warnings about the “enemy within” (meaning his political opponents), and a depiction of America as a failed democratic experiment – the “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/trump-us-garbage-can-immigration/index.html">garbage can of the world</a>.” </p><p data-line-id="79acdf665a8a4c6b8545264a6015ab71"> Authoritarians often tell you what they are going to do – both as a means of intimidating those who would resist and to condition the broader public for what is coming. Based on what Trump has said, we should prepare for a declaration of a state of emergency on or around “Day One” (the codeword used by Trump’s MAGA movement and its policy blueprint, Project 2025, for an authoritarian takeover). The trumped-up justification could be (non-existent) threats from the “radical Marxist left,” (non-existent) “immigrant invasions,” or some (non-existent) conspiracy hatched by the Democratic “enemy within” and foreign “globalist warmongers.” </p><p data-line-id="5c9985e23bf74844b7dccfb8dc8ec7c2"> Under this state of exception, Trump’s bureaucratic “army” (Project 2025’s label for its cadre of politicized civil servants) can then be deployed to “dismantle the administrative state,” thus completing the destruction of America’s liberal democratic institutions of governance. Over time, there would be steady suppression of reproductive and voting rights; a constant threat of political violence; unrestrained oligarchic plunder of public resources; soaring economic inequality; investigations of critics that end with imprisonment (or perhaps execution by firing squad – a recurrent Trump fantasy); and perhaps deployment of the military against protesters and to carry out mass deportations.  </p><p data-line-id="ebde542b18fe4517b9ace592ae11e0fc"> These abuses are familiar from the history of authoritarianism.

Democracy is very good at picking up on voters’ most passionate concerns. Americans were worried about inflation and immigration, and though democracy was also a big issue, the manner in which Vice President Kamala Harris was installed as the Democratic Party’s nominee following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race did raise eyebrows. The Democrats will undoubtedly engage in a painful postmortem of the failure to insist on a more democratic nominating process at their Chicago convention. </p><p data-line-id="939ac30308654105bcfca9e3973b97dc"> Unfortunately, though democracy is good at highlighting anxieties, it is not necessarily good at producing the best remedies. Americans are worried about price increases, but Trump’s proposed tariffs would make many goods even more expensive. Appliances, electronics, and clothing will all cost more, and American farmers – a key constituency in some states – will be hit hard when other countries retaliate. Everyone, including America, will suffer from a trade war. </p><p data-line-id="a003e99e7f8b45e5b2201b5f93724568"> Trade has been a central concern for Trump since the 1980s, when he was passionate about a supposed Japanese threat to take over the world. But this was always a blinkered view of the economic transformation that occurred in the late twentieth century, and Trump’s zero-sum mentality will do nothing to help Americans today. Similarly, his threat to expel undocumented immigrants – many of them employed in jobs Americans won’t do – is unlikely to reduce price pressures or create more jobs for US citizens. </p><p data-line-id="2c633f5041794ce994e8117725f7951a"> The new administration will inevitably blame the US Federal Reserve, rather than its own policies, for any renewed monetary turbulence. Meanwhile, the fiscal legacy of the global financial crisis, Trump’s first term, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Biden’s own spending policies will remain. Without a clear, coherent fiscal plan, a rising share of the budget will go toward debt service unless the administration succeeds in bullying the Fed to hold down interest rates. But if that happens, we can expect far higher inflation, and we can say goodbye to the dollar’s dominant position in the world financial system. </p><p data-line-id="5b1e71144ae4496c814bd28776887490"><em>Harold James, Professor of History and International Affairs at Princeton University, is the author, most recently, of </em><a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300263398/seven-crashes/">Seven Crashes: The Economic Crises That Shaped Globalization</a><em> (Yale University Press, 2023).</em></p><h2 data-line-id="4fd1646cdacb4407a33496e8dfe5f2ed"><strong>CHARLES A. KUPCHAN</strong></h2><p data-line-id="bda15faf2af04ca6bba181d847316339"> Donald Trump’s decisive victory answers, at least for now, a central question that was looming over the election: Will the political center hold? The answer, clearly, is no – and not just in the United States. Trump’s win does not auger well for the political center globally, including in Europe, where the ideological extremes continue to gain ground. Many of the world’s democracies appear headed for a prolonged period of polarization and illiberal populism, with the US leading the way. </p><p data-line-id="111a2b9a350b4a20ade66f61edbd7812"> Trump’s return to power should therefore serve as a wake-up call, prompting urgent efforts to tackle the factors that have hollowed out political centrism and fueled the growth of a strident populism. Those steps must address two key challenges. </p><p data-line-id="bf9ee7b464914e279254f5f74d51a655"> First, in the aftermath of the erosion of the social contract of the industrial era, the US needs to rebuild its middle class. Trump has promised to do so, turning to protective tariffs aimed at turning the US back into a “manufacturing powerhouse.” But protectionist barriers would not only risk blowing up the global economy; they would also fail to solve the problem. </p><p data-line-id="ed3ae2b60e4d4e789370d46ef1c57421"> In an era of digitization and automation, the scale of any conceivable manufacturing turnaround will not come close to what would be required to return a broad swath of working Americans to the middle class. Instead, the US government needs to work with the private sector to fashion an education and employment ecosystem that will enable working Americans to earn a living wage as automation, artificial intelligence, and other technologies evolve. Much of this effort needs to focus on creating and filling well-paid jobs in the service sector, where most Americans will work – and where roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/270072/distribution-of-the-workforce-across-economic-sectors-in-the-united-states/">80%</a> of the US workforce is already employed. The same goes for other advanced economies. </p><p data-line-id="7d51c949c93e4342a50588b46252e6ef"> Second, Trump needs to work with Congress to overhaul the nation’s broken immigration system. The influx of migrants across the southern border has been a major source of both polarization and electoral discontent. It is past time to enact legislation that secures the border, establishes an orderly and streamlined system for processing legal immigration, and charts a humane pathway for resolving the status of millions of undocumented migrants. Many other democracies, particularly in Europe, similarly need to tackle immigration reform. </p><p data-line-id="46ce0432eb474622a3936dd9b83d8ba0"> As for the global impact of his return to power, Trump promises to be far more unilateralist than isolationist. The world should be ready for a fiercely transactional foreign policy; foreign leaders should understand that they will be dealing with a real-estate mogul, not a statesman. Allies will need to spend more on their own defense to stay in Trump’s good graces. Ukraine had better get ready to seek a diplomatic endgame to its fight against Russian aggression. Israel may have a freer hand as it seeks to take down the “axis of resistance,” but it had better ready a postwar peace plan that will be to Trump’s liking. Allies and adversaries alike should get ready for a raft of new US tariffs, but they may be able to negotiate trade deals that strike Trump’s fancy, thereby helping prevent the fragmentation of the global economy. </p><p data-line-id="51d8c6b2f420487ab6db0e810f902206"> Trump won a commanding victory.

Voters in the second and third quintiles ($30,000-$99,999) experienced higher income growth during Trump’s previous administration, and favored Trump this time. Inflation likely eroded the purchasing power of their gains, leading to economic dissatisfaction. Among voters who felt that their family’s financial situation is worse now than four years ago, 81% supported Trump, suggesting that subjective perceptions of economic hardship may have outweighed actual income statistics. </p><p data-line-id="534d1fa5897b40f1ad7f243d440130a0"> Harris also faced unique challenges that may have affected voters’ perception of her.

Media narratives often <a href="https://www.readingthepictures.org/2024/03/the-disappearing-of-kamala-harris/">underreported</a> her achievements, while focusing on controversies or perceived shortcomings. As in 2016, Trump relied on simple, catchy language and anecdotes to tap into voters’ anxieties about the economy and immigration. He was well positioned to promise a return to the income growth that was achieved during his first term, and to respond forcefully to what are generally agreed to be significant challenges on the southern border. </p><p data-line-id="da6d264c86bd422ea37d3b5ff238407d"> Trump also ruthlessly attacked Harris’s credibility and relied on racist and sexist stereotypes – going so far as to call her “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/trump-harris-dumb-stupid-low-iq/">stupid</a>” and “low IQ.” And yet he has faced numerous indictments and allegations related to sexual misconduct, tax fraud, obstruction of justice, election interference, and incitement of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.

If you add in other campaign proposals (including some that would raise revenue), the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans">estimates</a> that Trump’s agenda would add $7.75 trillion to the United States’ projected national debt through 2035. This would be on top of the $26 trillion of debt already held by the public, which the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/ranking-member/newsroom/press/cbo-national-debt-to-reach-record-share-of-gdp-in-just-three-years">estimates</a> will increase to more than $50 trillion by 2034 even without Trump’s proposals. </p><p data-line-id="d56e532728424e9b95ca56a71f24cafd"> The US federal government does not have an official “budget constraint,” but such a large federal debt burden will certainly fuel pressure to cut spending. The question is what and where to cut. In 2023, discretionary spending – such as outlays for defense, transportation, veterans’ benefits, and education – comprised only about one-quarter of the budget. This is spending that must be appropriated each year and is negotiated as part of the budget process. Most of the spending is on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security (as well as a few others), which are mandated by law. Without completely gutting discretionary spending, there is not enough room to enact Trump’s desired agenda and have an appropriately sized federal budget. </p><p data-line-id="209c050005e543c0a7b5431a2753cd04"> And how to make space for new priorities? Unless policymakers are willing to reform entitlement programs and find additional sources of revenue, there will be very little fiscal space for policies needed to boost economic productivity – such as by investing in new infrastructure or finding ways to support an aging workforce. Furthermore, increasing the US federal debt promises to be inflationary, which will exacerbate many Americans’ economic woes. Trump will face many challenges during his second term, and policymakers can address them only if they have some fiscal breathing room to launch reforms. </p><p data-line-id="793bd3784dd14a1ea65cc856cd76c8b5"><em>Cecilia Elena Rouse, former chair of US President Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, is President of the Brookings Institution.</em></p><h2 data-line-id="3f40469cee7947b2a4db0a10f722ac7f"><strong>ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER</strong></h2><p data-line-id="5eb3e3aa6c494648aff5a6616b5aa8c4"> In 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency on a platform of hope and change, running on a political manifesto entitled <em>The Audacity of Hope </em>and a theme song called “Yes We Can.” Kamala Harris tried the same strategy this year, looking forward and trying to turn the page on an era of division and growing hate.

Yet millions of voters in red (Republican-leaning) and blue (Democratic) states and across demographic groups voted for Donald Trump, because they are deeply angry that the economy has not delivered for them. They want a change in direction – an economy that delivers gains for everyone.</p><p data-line-id="48097ec9c2bc413cb788cbdb88073f92">But, under Trump, they will not get what they want. They will get tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, paid for by eviscerating cuts to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other key middle-class programs. They will get larger federal budget deficits, and thus higher interest rates. They will get big across-the-board increases in tariffs that drive up prices, particularly for low- and middle-income consumers. The overall US economy will be dragged down by a stronger dollar, retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners, and the business uncertainty resulting from Trump’s plans to upend the rules and change or terminate programs across all major government agencies. Trump’s economic agenda is a recipe for stagflation and growing wage and income inequality.</p><p data-line-id="9ad79187c31848868c9b0a42db3ae4b5">Moreover, the Republicans’ plan to curtail reproductive rights for women will have negative <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/economy-wide-impact-of-reproductive-freedom-by-laura-tyson-2024-09">economic consequences</a> for women and their families. Despite historic storms and fires, Trump will walk away from the Inflation Reduction Act’s effective, business-friendly incentives to advance the clean-energy transition (even though red states have benefited disproportionately from these policies). In economic relations with China, Trump might adopt a “transactional art-of-the-deal” approach, negotiating bilateral agreements that reduce the US trade deficit. His oligarchic backer, Elon Musk, will do everything he can to keep Tesla’s Chinese competitors out of the US electric-vehicle market. That will keep prices high and slow the transition to EVs – a transition that is essential to curb carbon emissions and limit global warming.</p><p data-line-id="46ce675eb7e54fda8b84c7af461cea18">At the same time that he squanders US leadership on this key national-security and global challenge, he will likely give Russian President Vladimir Putin whatever he wants in Ukraine, and he will greenlight Binyamin Netanyahu’s plans to pursue armed conflict with Iran and kill off the prospect of a two-state solution. As he walks away from, or sharply limits America’s role in, NATO, Europeans will be on their own.</p><p data-line-id="e411ae0c49d346d18f0fb97a4e613192"><em>Laura Tyson, a former chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the Board of Advisers at Angeleno Group.</em><em><br/></em></p>
