<p data-line-id="6290e4c6adff4d7ea62629926a109d18"> TOKYO – Why did it take so long for Japan to have a female prime minister? This may seem like an unfair question. After all, the United States has never elected a female president, and a woman has never presided over the Communist Party of China. Even the Netherlands, once a bastion of liberalism, has never had a female prime minister. </p><p data-line-id="68520793877c4ab591976b3435aecf30"> There have been several female heads of state in Asia, but they were almost always the daughters of famous male leaders. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country’s first prime minister, while South Korean President Park Geun-hye was the daughter of Park Chung-hee, the military strongman who ruled in the 1960s and 1970s. </p><p data-line-id="67fc647d29fc44cbabf2f646aae3358b"> Still, Japan clearly has a gender problem. In the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2024/">Global Gender Gap Report 2024</a>, Japan ranked 118th out of 146 countries, whereas South Korea, arguably a more Confucian society than Japan, was 94th, and China was 106th. <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/018/2024/024/article-A001-en.xml">Less than 20%</a> of Japanese women have leadership roles in politics or business, despite their relatively <a href="https://www.nier.go.jp/English/educationjapan/pdf/201403GEE.pdf">high level of education</a>. Almost as many women <a href="https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=JPN&amp;treshold=5&amp;topic=EO">attend university</a> in Japan as men, but <a href="https://epicenter.wcfia.harvard.edu/news/2025/04/high-risk-no-reward-unpacking-gender-disparities-japanese-universities">only 20%</a> of students at the top institutions are female. </p><p data-line-id="bf816b832352414a844a675db18122b5"> Given this, the recent inauguration of Takaichi Sanae as Japan’s prime minister is undoubtedly a breakthrough. But does it signal a fundamental shift in Japanese gender relations? Will Takaichi help other women crack the glass ceiling? </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="76e42acadac844c785d3e28558fa0cf6"> Takaichi’s conservative views on social issues are not encouraging. She opposes allowing married women to keep their family names, as well as same-sex marriage. Her rhetoric about immigrants – without whom Japan can no longer properly function – is tinged with bigotry. </p><p data-line-id="63baec1d2a724c40a9110128c1ff5804"> During her campaign to lead the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Takaichi pandered to right-wing nationalists by <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/politics/Takaichi-pledges-to-deal-firmly-with-foreigners-who-violate-the-rules-specifics-unclear">spreading rumors</a> about foreign tourists’ bad behavior in Japan. And she has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-takaichi-makes-history-women-ask-what-changes-now-2025-10-21/">appointed</a> only two female ministers to her 19-member cabinet, which is fewer than in some previous Japanese governments. </p><p data-line-id="685bcd2cd0b14328a33bf18cf7986a9c"> Even so, one must admire Takaichi’s rise to the top of Japanese politics, which is still very much a man’s world – leading a male-dominated conservative party, no less. She is unusual in other ways, too. Unlike many top politicians in Japan, or indeed other female leaders in Asia, Takaichi does not come from a political family. She grew up in a conservative provincial home, with a mother who thought that girls didn’t need to attend university. Takaichi insisted that she should. </p><p data-line-id="3adf1843b2524f72b9ff4b6890a969d5"> Like her idol, Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdom’s first female prime minister, Takaichi presents herself as an “Iron Lady” who can be tougher than the men. (Thatcher famously scolded US President George H.W. Bush not to go “<a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document%2F110711">wobbly</a>” when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.) That also means maintaining a feminine appearance and being ready with a smile to balance her masculine traits and interests, which include heavy metal music and motorcycles. </p><p data-line-id="3d61a5e4bedb4987bbd32c0872e17e38"> Perhaps the only way a woman can climb to the top of conservative parties in most countries is to be more hawkish than her male counterparts. Former German Chancellor <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> was not particularly hawkish in her political views, but she was more ruthless than her male rivals, which enabled her to outmaneuver them. Once in power, Merkel projected a kind of maternal reassurance: In her warm embrace, all would be well. </p><p data-line-id="6ceb75f80d8941efba69b026a416437d"> This was not Thatcher’s style; nor is it Takaichi’s. She is hawkish on immigration and defense, and, like her mentor, the late Prime Minister <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/abe-shinzo">Abe Shinzō</a>, she has no time for dwelling on Japanese crimes in World War II and sees no problem with <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/10/17/japan/politics/takaichi-yasukuni-skip/">sending an offering</a> to the Yasukuni Shrine, where convicted war criminals are among those honored. </p><p data-line-id="8e3fd744166440bf86c18e11c1708550"> Takaichi’s <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/japan-s-new-pm/japan-pm-takaichi-vows-to-boost-defense-spending-to-2-of-gdp-by-march">decision</a> to boost defense spending to 2% of GDP by March and her <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pmy7m72lo">desire</a> to revise Japan’s pacifist constitution have pleased US President Donald Trump, whom she seemingly won over at their <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/31/asia/us-japan-trump-takaichi-analysis-intl-hnk">first meeting</a>. Trump even <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/10/28/japan/politics/trump-takaichi-us-japan-summit-talks/">introduced</a> her as “a winner,” noting that they had “become very close friends all of a sudden.” But Takaichi’s pugnacious views are so alarming to the Chinese that they <a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/b0004tgo">have yet to congratulate</a> her on her victory. </p><p data-line-id="d600eacc423d4b01bdcad6c6c320a461"> Just as Thatcher <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1986/02/10/the-gamefish">disparaged</a> the more liberal-minded politicians in the Conservative Party as “wets,” Takaichi has a knack for making some of her fellow LDP members – including her predecessor, the hapless Ishiba Shigeru – look like wimps. This could make her an effective leader. She may even succeed where Abe failed, by revising the constitution and giving the Japanese military a greater role. </p><p data-line-id="5a874e3ddaf643a7b570c2b323cc2bee"> The one area where she differs from Abe, at least in her rhetoric, is immigration. Abe relaxed visa requirements to ensure that Japan’s industrial, agriculture, and construction sectors could hire the foreign labor they need. He also promoted tourism to bring in added revenue. In contrast, Takaichi has taken a tough stance on migration. But, by taking the sting out of far-right parties that trade in xenophobia, she might have an easier time quietly continuing Abe’s policies. </p><p data-line-id="e1c381ae852f49a08870b63d5a1dbdf9"> Takaichi seems uninterested in helping women to succeed in public life. And yet her example may be her greatest contribution on this front. When Barack Obama won the US presidency in 2008, Black people in Harlem were dancing in the streets. I remember a proud father shouting in joy: “My son can become president of the United States!” Japanese mothers can now feel the same about their daughters. That is no small thing. </p>

Just ask residents of Spain and Portugal, who were suddenly faced with a total blackout last April, when a series of cascading voltage surges <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7d4vjdlrmo">shut down</a> their electricity grids. Both Spain and Portugal are now pursuing massive investments in strengthening their grids’ resilience. But citizens should not have to wait until after disaster strikes for their leaders to commit to investing in critical infrastructure, which nowadays includes cloud services. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfc5e73178c34b13b0d7379aa178fc2f"> CHICAGO – In a recent <em>Financial </em><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f6be08a-fd24-4558-b373-6ada31e18900" target="_blank">commentary</a></span>, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins argued that, “the SEC should only require companies to supply information under the objective standard of whether a reasonable investor would regard it as important to an investment decision. Rules written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment fail this test – and fail investors.” </p><p data-line-id="981256e5a26845ebb0f2b5d92bfc65f8"> At face value, Atkins’ statement seems unexceptional. But it leaves open a key question: What is material to a firm’s financial performance? Atkins suggests that disclosure should not be driven by “political fads or distorted objectives,” citing the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which expands and standardizes corporate sustainability reporting to improve transparency and comparability of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information. Such disclosures, he argues, “may be socially significant but are not generally financially material.”  </p><p data-line-id="fd2eddf66f2e4ae6b2672ffe904754c1"> But this sounds like wishful thinking. If European regulators think the environment matters and they act on that belief, that materially affects multinational firms’ costs of doing business in Europe. Just last month, a Paris <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f3e072e-d136-4174-ad74-d5bbc14e8a99">court</a> found TotalEnergies had engaged in “misleading commercial practices” by claiming it was “a major actor in the energy transition.” Citing EU legislation that requires green claims to be supported by “objective, publicly available, and verifiable commitments and targets,” the court found the company’s climate pronouncements to be inconsistent with its expanded investments in hydrocarbons. While the fines Total has incurred are small, such fines are likely to be larger in the future – and thus material to investors. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="7282690d004044cc9e4bd8131856e1d2"> Obviously, US regulators today put little weight on companies’ green strategies or the need to disclose them. But if regulators elsewhere care more, such strategies are still material to firms that do business across borders. And since there is a deep divide in the United States between Democrats and Republicans on the merits of ESG policies, a company that avoids ESG-related actions during the current administration might find itself hamstrung in a future one. Shouldn’t investors who value long-run earnings be able to make their own judgments about these issues? Regardless of whether ESG is a political fad (or whether opposition to it is), disclosures of ESG-aligned practices may still be material to the bottom line. </p><p data-line-id="593b688c3d4142ec97f0b630b482b93c"> Nor are regulators the only ones who might care. In the TotalEnergies case, the concern was that customers will be misled by the company’s environmental pronouncements. In a warming world, it is reasonable to expect that some people’s purchasing decisions might well be swayed by a company’s environmental practices.  </p><p data-line-id="88fb40cfaa354cd0b734ba66a975eeac"> Moreover, research <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bbr/a/THJmk5T7WKCKTJgXvT8NnQt">suggests</a> that Brazilian firms with better environmental practices (when certified by regulators) attract more skilled workers and ultimately perform better. Thus, whether environmental practices command universal political appeal is beside the point. If they attract a preferred kind of worker and enhance a firm’s bottom line, the company’s shareholders would want to know about it. </p><p data-line-id="a408f572609444aeb7bc245fca049710"> Atkins does raise a potentially valid concern about the intended audience for corporate disclosures. He opposes rules “written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment.” But, again, what if some shareholders are willing to sacrifice returns for socially beneficial practices? Should their preferences be ignored?  </p><p data-line-id="91fb1d0b89804e89a7f0f95e6a4ff7e8"> The argument for focusing solely on financial returns has always been that, by doing so, the firm empowers minority investors to go and spend their enhanced share of wealth on whatever social or political cause they prefer. The company does not need to cater to their whims to empower them. Yet Oliver Hart of Harvard and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luigi-zingales">Luigi Zingales</a> of the University of Chicago make a <a href="https://hart.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/companies-should-maximize-shareholder-welfare-not-market-value">compelling argument</a> that shareholders may prefer that the company act directly on their concerns. The shareholder-value argument suggests that a firm should continue to pollute the environment to maximize profits and its share price, because its environmentally conscious shareholders can then use some of their enhanced wealth to fund a clean-up. But the problem with this view should be obvious: Environmental remediation tends to be much more costly than preventing pollution in the first place, so shareholders and society alike would be better off if the firm sacrificed some profits to follow cleaner practices. </p><p data-line-id="b3c15f1081734448881a0cbc8dd8e687"> Put differently, the SEC cannot simply dismiss socially motivated investors as a nuisance, because this cohort may form the majority in some firms, and their interests may not be served if the firm simply maximizes profits. In a world where investors are inundated with information, the SEC is right to ask what is and is not material. Mandatory SEC disclosures are valuable insofar as the information is more reliable than anything that is voluntarily disclosed. Since disclosure does impose a burden on firms, it should be mandated judiciously.  </p><p data-line-id="36dcc4f6e94a4239b6bfaa2bc60f4ccf"> But the SEC must recognize that a wide variety of interests look at such disclosures, and that their effects are material. To dismiss these concerns as political is to engage in politicization oneself. It is better to recognize that there are many channels through which disclosure can affect investors and society, and then make the necessary tradeoffs in SEC mandates. </p>

<p data-line-id="3dd3917fa757457eb435f061c4db58f6"> BEIJING – According to US President Donald Trump, his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping – the first of his second term – was “amazing.” Trump may have campaigned on the promise of squeezing America’s biggest geopolitical competitor, but that is not what has happened. Instead, top Chinese academics and retired military leaders whom I spoke to in Beijing this week all agree that Xi’s international strategy has been vindicated, and that an increasingly fractured multipolar world is working very much to China’s advantage. </p>

With a significant amount of foreign debt coming due next year, the conventional wisdom was that an exchange-rate-based stabilization program – letting the currency depreciate by less than the inflation rate to push inflation down – had led to a massively overvalued currency and an external deficit that was bound to precipitate a crisis. But having written a <a href="https://www.piie.com/bookstore/bailouts-or-bail-ins-responding-financial-crises-emerging-economies">book</a> on currency crises in emerging markets, and having followed Argentine policies closely, I thought this consensus was far off the mark.  </p>

<p data-line-id="f42024df344943ea9dd5f4cae8f4c4c0"> JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR – For decades, integration into the global trading system has been vital to economic growth and development. Now, however, integration implies vulnerability, as powerful actors – beginning with the United States – wield tariffs, export restrictions, and financial sanctions. For Southeast Asia, this turn of events represents both a warning and a call to action: countries must work together to shape their own destiny – or others will decide their fate for them. </p>

<p data-line-id="e330e3f2b09b45f0be2ccd549926c8c4"> DHAKA – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30) comes at a decisive moment, not just for the climate agenda but for international cooperation more broadly. Following last year’s “finance COP” in Baku – where countries agreed to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop29-un-climate-conference-agrees-to-triple-finance-to-developing-countries-protecting-lives-and">triple</a> the global target for climate finance – this year’s gathering is being framed as the “implementation COP.” </p><p data-line-id="f37e51257a9c4571b316868bf05bdcd3"> After years of negotiations, the time for ambitious commitments has passed. We now need concrete action. That means actually mobilizing climate finance, not as an act of charity, but as a strategic investment in global resilience, shared prosperity, and mutual security. </p><p data-line-id="68972c57aa1f4a5ea8080ac27bb8c96c"> Developing countries are not coming to the table empty-handed. We are bringing ambitious climate plans, national commitments, and domestic financing of our own. Bangladesh, for example, draws 75% of its climate finance from its own resources, and allocates 6-7% of its annual budget to climate-related efforts. </p><p data-line-id="6c5918510ac743f5a8d049791b30a022"> Many developing countries are also submitting updated Nationally Determined Contributions (the Paris climate agreement’s term for emissions-reduction plans), strengthening their policy frameworks, and pioneering locally driven solutions that can inform global best practices. Thus, Bangladesh recently submitted its “NDC 3.0,” which sets an unconditional emissions-reduction target of 6.39% by 2035 (in the business-as-usual scenario), and a conditional target of 13.92%. </p><p data-line-id="555cb46b72d84ed7afe7e4fcfccbb479"> But the total investment required to implement our NDC is a staggering $116 billion. That is why we have also created the Bangladesh Climate and Development Platform (BCDP), a nationally owned mechanism designed to scale up climate finance and integrate national climate strategies. With strong political support, the BCDP brings together more than ten ministries, marking a significant milestone in coordinated, country-led climate action. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9b50a3449c3f4c2ba828670dbdc847cc"> As a coastal country, Bangladesh is home to some of the world’s most fragile ecosystems, including the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the world’s largest river delta. These ecosystems provide essential services such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and disaster-risk reduction. Protecting them is vital not only for Bangladesh, but for the planet. Doing so, however, requires international support. </p><p data-line-id="d83849951dbe4e62a7585395c08d378c"> The same message applies across the Global South. While developing countries are stepping up, their plans require external support. The COP29 commitment to mobilize $300 billion per year in international climate finance, starting next year, must be the baseline. This figure still represents only a small fraction of what is needed, and we still need to ensure that financing is managed with a higher level of accountability. Developed countries must be held to their commitments, so that new funding is truly additional, rather than being repurposed from existing development aid. </p><p data-line-id="b350c2724a884f28b87ed23a37ede956"> Another priority concerns the quality of financing, which must be well structured, accessible, and effective. That means clarifying how much each developed country will contribute; how resources will be balanced between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage; and how delivery will be made predictable and fair. </p><p data-line-id="a2a536755c154e898bf2cb7028382e15"> Loans that push developing countries further into debt are not sustainable. A much larger share of finance must come in the form of grants and highly concessional flows. The world cannot build climate resilience on the back of fiscal instability. This was already a recurring theme in Baku, and now COP30 gives us a chance to translate it into a clear policy framework. </p><p data-line-id="cef703dacdaa485bb50c1aa2b1db997a"> Climate finance is sound economics, representing opportunity, not just obligation. Studies <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-adaptation-investment-case">show</a> that every $1 invested in adaptation can generate more than $10 in long-term benefits. For developed countries, supporting adaptation and resilience abroad helps stabilize supply chains, reduce disaster risks, and prevent future crises that will spill over borders. </p><p data-line-id="d7e35d48c3064f418714baf3a28e9bd2"> At the same time, developing countries hold vast, often untapped, potential to drive the global energy transition, safeguard food systems, and power sustainable growth. Bangladesh, for example, is the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2025/06/09/reinventing-rice-as-countries-cultivate-change">third-largest</a> rice producer. Helping us achieve resilience against climate shocks is critical for domestic and global food security. We also contribute to global value chains through seafood, textiles, and a dynamic, skilled workforce. With young people comprising <a href="http://thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/youths-account-28pc-population-3293161">28%</a> of our population, we have the potential to be a key partner in many growth industries of the future. </p><p data-line-id="a4ea33f39bc34ad3a9a35938c7e19b62"> As an investment in our shared future, climate finance requires partnerships that will benefit everyone – economically, socially, and environmentally. But merely increasing our financing targets is not enough. Last year, developing countries engaged in good faith to reach an agreement on climate finance, even though the outcome did not fully reflect our needs. That commitment to dialogue must now be matched by a commitment to clarity and delivery. We need all countries to engage constructively in shaping the structure of climate finance. The question is not just how much, but how it flows, and how it can best be used to drive long-term transformations. </p><p data-line-id="e29b52fa264040219ef39c207cb165f7"> Already, Brazil and Azerbaijan are co-leading efforts to build a roadmap to scale climate finance to <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t">$1.3 trillion</a> annually by 2035. But we cannot reach that goal without laying the foundation for it. That means delivering the promised $300 billion per year through mechanisms that are transparent, fair, and effective. </p><p data-line-id="b371b9ba379d48fbadd047ce34f5bb72"> With multilateralism in crisis, we must restore faith in the process. Multilateralism has delivered before, and it can do so again. COP30 is where we can prove that the international system is capable of moving from commitment to implementation, and from division to cooperation. We have the tools, and we have the knowledge. What we need now is the will to turn climate finance into a shared engine for growth, security, and a fairer future. </p>

The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty – including independent India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra – is bound up with the history of India’s struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright. This idea has penetrated Indian politics across every party, in every region, and at every level. </p>

The more we swallow these lies now, the harder it will be to question future falsehoods, because that would challenge our view of ourselves as intelligent beings. </p>

<p data-line-id="74b62ca2bc2042679745c9efda1785fb"> BEIJING – Traditional donors have sharply scaled back their aid commitments to developing countries over the past year. Some, like the United States, have virtually eliminated their aid programs. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), official development assistance (ODA) from member countries <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/04/official-development-assistance-2024-figures.html">declined by 7.1%</a> in 2024, its first annual drop in six years. </p><p data-line-id="db16ef9778d541498df6d7f1b438603b"> This trend was not limited to a few major donors. Of the 33 members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 22 slashed their aid budgets, and only four countries met the United Nations’ target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA. </p><p data-line-id="7f360c9899044473881a52a34e9a1261"> The outlook for the coming year offers little hope for improvement, as major DAC donors have announced additional cuts. Most notably, US President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended most foreign aid and dismantled the Agency for International Development (USAID), which dispersed most US government aid dollars.  </p><p data-line-id="67f10eb20fdd480d99dce191574b0874"> Meanwhile, the United Kingdom plans to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o">reduce aid spending</a> from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027. Similar retrenchment across Europe and North America is reshaping international assistance, disrupting humanitarian and climate-related programs, and creating financing gaps in critical sectors such as health, education, and clean energy. </p><p data-line-id="9f5025fc6e774589897c6b4d8107b56c"> In our 2017 book <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/going-beyond-aid/B48F59C6D8D2790D403A1A0C44B37612"><em>Going Beyond Aid</em></a>, we urged developing-country governments to reduce their dependence on foreign aid, not only because it was becoming an unreliable source of funding, but also because other, better ways of financing development were becoming more available. That message is more urgent than ever.  </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="f2fbc8217dd44edbaa41c6a024eb3cb9"> As reliance on aid becomes untenable, the international community must mobilize a broader array of financing sources to advance green and sustainable growth. This includes national development banks, industrial investment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investment in public markets, as well as innovative mechanisms such as debt swaps and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These tools can unlock domestic resources, attract long-term investors, and create synergies between public goals and private capital. </p><p data-line-id="085080d643d242608c20fff83e8cb509"> Equity investment offers a promising avenue for engaging non-traditional development partners while reducing developing countries’ dependence on debt. Government investment funds, public and private financial institutions, and other private actors can participate by taking equity stakes in public enterprises, financing infrastructure projects, or joining PPPs. Such participation not only alleviates debt burdens but also improves the performance and management of public assets.  </p><p data-line-id="77eaaf7f82c14059aa1f5fd1bd351d40"> As government-funded, mission-driven institutions, public development banks (PDBs) have the potential to provide patient capital for green and sustainable investment in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). Building on the <a href="http://www.dfidatabase.pku.edu.cn/index.htm">pioneering database</a> of public development and financial institutions created by the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, future research can identify effective ways to harness these institutions to fuel low-carbon growth. </p><p data-line-id="2f5328d4c82f4a5f8af27c762a6e45a3"> Responding to growing demand from the economies of the Global South, development partners have increasingly adopted an “entire value chain” approach to the green transition in recent years. This strategy facilitates transfers of low-carbon technologies, diffusion of digital innovations (including trade in services), and industrial modernization, enabling countries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to accelerate their shift toward sustainable development. </p><p data-line-id="a2d0b991d4534f9f96805570ae26520b"> Empirical research supports this approach. An analysis covering 139 countries <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">finds</a> that, following policy directives to incorporate green and low-carbon principles into the BRI, carbon intensity (CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions per unit of GDP) among participating countries declined significantly between 2013 and 2022. These findings are consistent with another <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">recent study</a> showing how China’s solar-energy expansion has helped transform Africa’s power sector. </p><p data-line-id="7e2beb6224ab49b89b05e589fe3cc988"> Investment in infrastructure and industrial development can also generate positive spillover effects. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.70023">shows</a> that the presence of at least one Chinese-financed infrastructure project in a second-order administrative region (comparable to a municipality) is associated with a 5% increase in nighttime luminosity – a widely used proxy for economic activity. Neighboring regions experienced a 10-15% rise in luminosity, indicating that the benefits of such projects extend well beyond the immediate investment site. <br/></p><figure data-line-id="b5f95dd16ef944eb98909a174d97b475"><img data-image="8wr68ph8q7uf" src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/3269ab77d3d209c71e81f97eafb2c31e.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="ff5f8242138c4bda9efed2524f80b643"> These outcomes underscore the critical role of infrastructure investment, particularly in energy and transportation projects. By improving electricity access, affordability, and connectivity, they reduce energy poverty, bolster public services, and stimulate economic activity in underserved areas. </p><p data-line-id="a9eaa69bb62540a6884597c0535298b0"> To meet the evolving challenges of development finance, both traditional and non-traditional donors and creditors should move beyond aid and adopt multidimensional strategies that combine trade, investment, infrastructure, green technology, and digital connectivity, including fintech solutions, to support EMDEs. Importantly, such collaborations should be viewed as a mutual learning process in which partners assume complementary roles and shared responsibilities. </p><p data-line-id="6aa7a3e6b02243cd8146cc264d97fcf2"> To be sure, there have been missteps along the way. China’s financing of coal-fired power plants before 2021, for example, had slowed reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions. But these outcomes, once recognized as policy errors, can help strengthen accountability and foster self-correcting mechanisms within the international development ecosystem. Through ongoing learning and adaptation, global partners can build a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable framework for development finance.  </p>

<p data-line-id="9a2b1e0afa33424396e9285d9cac3321">The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.</p>

<p data-line-id="a33989bba1144aab990b7bd14f1b3e07"> NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump spent much of the last week of October in Asia. He managed to bring about ceasefires on several fronts of a trade war largely of his own making, after imposing tariffs on friends and foes alike. What he did not do, though, was create enduring structures in the economic sphere or put to rest increasing doubts about the United States’ strategic commitment to the region.  </p>

<p data-line-id="150cc2ef04b24bf2873fa5cba9a8b072"> DUBAI – Almost everywhere, debates about AI remain narrowly focused, indeed almost fixated, on its impact on employment and return on investment. Which jobs will disappear? Which skills will endure? Are current valuations justified? These questions, while important, overlook a deeper issue: whether firms – the institutions that have organized economic life for the past two centuries – will themselves survive in their current form in the wake of AI.</p>

<p data-line-id="9c31c3bba0ca4f09ba39bd62722ee9cb"> EDINBURGH – Ahead of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, countries are being urged to embrace an approach to climate action and finance with social protection at its heart. Making this connection could not be more important for protecting human dignity, building community resilience, and maximizing the impact of limited funds. </p>
<p data-line-id="8f22d9be7a68444bb490124f51e7d393"> At COP29 last year, developed economies <a href="https://unctad.org/news/countries-agree-300-billion-2035-new-climate-finance-goal-what-next">agreed</a> to mobilize at least $300 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, as part of the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. But least-developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states have rightly criticized the target as vague, unenforceable, and inadequate. In fact, this figure falls far short of need, especially because climate-finance delivery is often highly inefficient. For example, just <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/the-climate-finance-gap-for-small-scale-agrifood-systems/">0.8%</a> of tracked funds reach small-scale agricultural systems. </p>
<p data-line-id="c20e3f41b16d424ea80e5cc7ea2dc50f"> This is where social protection comes in. A 2019 <a href="https://www.ldc-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LIFE-AR-Evidence-Review-English.pdf">study</a> by the LDC Initiative for Effective Adaptation and Resilience (LIFE-AR) showed that social-protection initiatives can play a powerful role in building climate-resilient communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">Sixth Assessment Report</a>, released in 2023, echoed this finding. Now, a <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/social-protection-and-inclusive-climate-action-review-social-protection-rural-populations">joint review</a> of 23 Green Climate Fund-funded projects, carried out by the GCF and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), has shown that the integration of climate objectives into social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering limited finance where it is needed most.  </p>
<p data-line-id="fe8ca9f780d4479cb5ebe01faf42fb97"> There are plenty of proven social-protection models that advance inclusive climate action. For example, Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/893931468321850632/ethiopias-productive-safety-net-program-psnp-integrating-disaster-and-climate-risk-management-case-study">supports</a> over eight million people – including the country’s most climate-vulnerable communities – through cash and food transfers, while responding to short-term shocks like droughts and restoring degraded landscapes. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="76d4d1d7da674b48b4ca03fb1559e255"> Similarly, India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which <a href="https://www.jobguarantee.org/program/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega-or-nrega">reaches</a> more than 60 million rural households, funds climate-smart solutions like rainwater harvesting and afforestation (tree-planting), which protect communities against droughts and floods. Brazil’s Bolsa Verde links income support to environmental stewardship, incentivizing sustainable land use and forest conservation among low-income families in protected areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="22862292bf2046338d6f95a7165e6c18"> The 23 GCF projects sampled in the recent FAO-GCF review show similar promise. Paraguay’s <a href="https://proezavep.mef.gov.py/cms/uploads/Annex_G_Environmental_and_Social_Standard_Management_Framework_Final_4d38a2e571.pdf">Poverty, Reforestation, Energy, and Climate Change Project</a>, which receives technical support from the FAO, ties conditional cash transfers to social-welfare goals, such as the establishment of climate-sensitive agricultural and forestry systems, and emphasizes indigenous participation. Botswana’s <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/ecosystem-based-adaptation-and-mitigation-botswana-s-communal-rangelands">Ecosystem-Based Adaptation and Mitigation in Communal Rangelands</a> project aims to advance similar goals, with women comprising 60% of its participants. </p>
<p data-line-id="a3804179a72648808f3c89d133f8e813"> But, despite some successes, inclusion remains a formidable challenge. As it stands, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/publications/flagship-reports/world-social-protection-report-2024-26-universal-social-protection-climate">almost half</a> of the world’s population – including many of those most exposed to the effects of climate change – lacks access to any kind of social-safety net. This helps to explain why only three of the projects reviewed in the FAO-GCF report were in low-income countries. Moreover, only six of those projects included people with disabilities, a mere four incorporated young people, and none involved migrants. Of the seven project areas where indigenous peoples were present, only four included them. </p>
<p data-line-id="841d9ca8c59e4508bfab0b5f567e52c3"> Outcomes, too, fell short. For example, the FAO finds that heat stress <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/62b46527-6ddc-4b8b-9078-bc32c14978f5/content">widens the income gap</a> between female-headed and male-headed households by $37 billion a year, and floods by $16 billion. But while several of the 23 GCF projects were gender-responsive, none was transformative. In addition, fewer than half of the GCF projects included efforts to strengthen existing social-protection systems, undermining their long-term sustainability and scalability. Social-insurance mechanisms were absent. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc8cca21c1440ce8507eda266a83b92"> Improving outcomes will require a fundamental shift in the prevailing approach to designing, financing, and implementing social protection. Rather than continue to depend on short-term project-based grants – the scale of which is necessarily limited – we must emphasize longer-term, coordinated initiatives, focused on building national systems and capabilities, while supporting locally led adaptation. A whole-of-government approach, involving ministries responsible for climate, social protection, and emergency management, is essential. And inclusion must be built into every stage of the process. </p>
<p data-line-id="bd62bacfef824c99adf7a9bf1a2fe3be"> The GCF can play an important role in advancing this shift. It is well-positioned to catalyze additional, longer-term financing for social protection, taking advantage of innovative mechanisms, such as debt-for-climate swaps and green bonds. Furthermore, it recently introduced reforms to its accreditation model, focused on improving transparency, responsiveness, and efficiency, though more flexibility is still needed for low-income countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="1548f8c09fc045daa33a2d6b21ea8316"> But the GCF cannot do it alone. Other multilateral climate funds must also step up, including by establishing dedicated financing tracks and streamlining access for low-income countries. Governments, for their part, must establish social protection as a pillar of their climate strategies, including Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and the operational frameworks of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage. Development partners and UN agencies must strengthen technical support for inclusive, long-term strategies, not just short-term projects. </p>
<p data-line-id="cb894cc631cb43da9581b9945842312b"> COP30 has been designated the “implementation COP,” focused on turning plans and pledges into actions and outcomes. It thus represents the ideal opportunity to apply the lessons from the FAO-GCF report, which lays out clear pathways for scaling social protection to enhance inclusive climate action. </p>

highlight research on the costs of decarbonizing the four highest-emitting sectors in major emerging economies.        </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="92d77dc44d594768a5b004d926c8afa1"> NEW DELHI – Discussions about climate finance often focus on the most vulnerable countries, such as small island developing states – and for good reason. But the nine major emerging-market economies (EMEs) – Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey – also have significant climate-finance needs, which must be met if the world is to have any chance of achieving its climate goals. Nowhere are those needs larger than in China. </p><p data-line-id="c14083a1fb2f43ee82097d6322275289"> This is a key finding of our <a href="https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Finance-Needs-of-Nine-G20-EMEs.pdf">new study</a>, which examined the climate-finance needs for the four highest-emitting sectors (power, steel, cement, and road transport) in the nine major EMEs for the period 2022-30. We estimate that China’s climate-finance requirements for these sectors amount to some $1.3 trillion – 61% of the total climate finance required by all nine EMEs ($2.2 trillion) – implying an annual average of $155 billion. The steel sector has the highest need (55% of the total), followed by road transport (25%), cement (16%), and power (4%). </p><p data-line-id="79e494264bc04d509474a861f031f422"> Start with steel. In 2022, China accounted for 77% of carbon dioxide emissions from steel production in the nine EMEs. We expect this share to decline to 66% by 2030, as slowing economic growth, falling investment in new infrastructure projects, and declining downstream demand cause China’s annual steel output to drop from 1,020 million tons to 910 million tons. </p><p data-line-id="4cc65755b9b948d6be2b840472ede37b"> Nonetheless, because of the production method used, the carbon intensity of China’s steel industry is particularly high – 1.8 tons emitted per ton of steel produced. Completely decarbonizing the sector will cost China $733 billion, or $80 billion per year until 2030. That is 65% of the total finance needed to decarbonize the steel sectors of all nine major EMEs. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="6e74da3c73cd4422a84d577f99372e0c"> The story is similar in the cement sector. China’s share of total emissions (across the nine EMEs) stood at 70% in 2022, but it is likely to fall to 52% by 2030, as cement production declines from 2,100 million tons to 1,475 million tons. The reason for this decline is simple: 67% of China’s population has already been <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3443">67% urbanized</a>, and the country has largely completed its high-speed rail and road networks, so construction activity is likely to slow in the coming years. But decarbonizing this sector will not be cheap: $453 billion across the nine economies in 2022-30, with China accounting for 48% of the total. </p><p data-line-id="14ef2898319e441ba4c7b9c02e334099"> Like steel, cement is a hard-to-abate sector, where investment in technological solutions for mitigating emissions has not yet led to a significant reduction in costs. Decarbonizing both industries, in China and elsewhere, will thus depend significantly on the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage technology – a costly proposition. Increased investment in relevant research and development is crucial. </p><p data-line-id="b9f8e68b677d481ca1adc1ffaad4e103"> As for road transport, China is well on its way toward an electric future. The country is responsible for about 70% of all electric vehicles produced globally each year, and in 2022, it accounted for 97% of all EV sales across the nine EMEs – a figure that should decline somewhat, to 73%, by 2030. The share of EVs in China is projected to rise to 63% (45 million units) in 2030, despite a projected decline in overall vehicle sales to 72 million units, compared to 85 million in 2022. </p><p data-line-id="758d91a5738f477284f94f4274b9e1d2"> But completing the transition from internal-combustion-engine vehicles to EVs will still require significant capital expenditure. Developing the necessary charging infrastructure alone will cost $460 billion across all nine countries, with China accounting for a whopping 97% ($446 billion) of the total. This largely reflects the fact that China is developing mainly high-speed charging stations, which cost about seven times more than conventional chargers. </p><p data-line-id="50e29f80cc6e406397529a0cf7a0ba4b"> Finally, there is the power sector, which, perhaps counter-intuitively, will not require huge amounts of climate finance. Here, too, China is already on the right track. While its total installed energy capacity is projected to increase from about 2,800 gigawatts in 2023 to 4,800 GW by 2030, fossil fuels’ share in that capacity should fall from about 45% in 2023 to 35% by 2030, thanks to the rapid expansion of solar and wind energy. </p><p data-line-id="02d08535261546d99af3185013d68b10"> As for cost, China should be able to decarbonize its power sector for about $55 billion in 2024-30, or $8 billion per year, including investments in generation and storage. The total decarbonization-finance requirement for all nine major EMEs over that period should amount to roughly $150 billion.  </p><p data-line-id="2808b75dc6ce4ced8107d33f755528d4"> Taken together, these figures might seem daunting, but for China, they are well within reach. After all, the total climate-finance requirement amounts to just 0.7% of the country’s GDP, and China’s current annual investment rate is about 40% of GDP. Add to that its high savings rate and persistent current-account surplus, and China should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily, using only domestic sources. With the climate-finance gaps for the other major EMEs smaller than they seem – India comes in a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-research-estimates-india-true-climate-finance-needs-by-rakesh-mohan-and-janak-raj-2025-08">distant second</a> – there is reason to hope for progress on meeting the world’s climate goals. </p>
