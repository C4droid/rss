<p data-line-id="0ac8c4d4b2894be6a91d6836f59a28c8"> BAKU – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku is taking place against a tumultuous geopolitical backdrop. In addition to shifting strategic alliances, trade tensions, and violent conflict, the “year of elections” has ushered in a period of heated political rhetoric and led to changes of government. </p><p data-line-id="bffdfc88370f4e049a8a444bd1336728"> But this must not distract us from the current state of the planet and the real economy. The effects and costs of climate change are increasing. Extreme weather events, from hurricanes in the Caribbean to catastrophic floods in Europe and droughts in the Amazon, are growing more frequent and intense, enhancing the risk of financial instability, especially in the world’s most vulnerable and highly indebted countries. </p><p data-line-id="cb9b489e98ba4c95bcb123db0fa82d5f"> At the same time, an energy revolution is already in full swing: the deployment of renewables is growing exponentially, and annual investment in clean power sources now far exceeds that in fossil fuels. Citizens and companies are also increasingly aware of the need to invest in climate-change adaptation. The European Investment Bank Group’s most recent <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2024-406-94-of-europeans-support-measures-to-adapt-to-climate-change-according-to-eib-survey">climate survey</a><strong> </strong>shows that 94% of Europeans and 88% of Americans support adaptation measures, while around half of respondents say that such measures should be a national priority. </p><p data-line-id="19ec78c0d3414b25ad5f1ff9e5c843c7"> Moreover, economic growth is quickly <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-gdp-decoupling">decoupling</a> from carbon dioxide emissions, owing to breakthroughs and innovation in clean-energy generation and efficiency technologies that help combat climate change and boost competition. The European Union has been a <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d0671350-37f2-4bc4-88e8-088d0508fb03_en">pioneer</a> in this area, cutting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by more than one-third since 1990, over which time its economy grew by 68%. The International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-global-growth-of-renewables-to-2030-is-set-to-match-entire-power-capacity-of-major-economies-today-moving-world-closer-to-tripling-goal">forecasts</a> that renewables will meet nearly half of global electricity demand by 2030. Emissions from the EU, the United States, and most advanced economies are declining even as their economic output expands, while China’s may <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-no-growth-for-chinas-emissions-in-q3-2024-despite-coal-power-rebound/">peak this year</a> – much earlier than expected. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="a53deee89eb94cc6ba5532c36ec9d639"> After years of warnings and calls for action, there are finally signs that the green transition has shifted into high gear. The reason is simple: clean energy is <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/issues/renewable-energy#solutions">now cheaper and more efficient</a> than fossil fuels, largely owing to improved battery storage. As a result, the right thing to do for our planet is now also the smart thing to do for our economies. Every dollar invested in climate adaptation and resilience can save between <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2019/sgsm19807.doc.htm">$5-7 in future disaster costs</a>, not to mention lives and livelihoods. </p><p data-line-id="9b772765a26e421d92923993195771b7"> Most businesses are well aware of these savings and have acted accordingly. Around 60% of the more than 12,000 firms across the EU and the US <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/publications/20240238-econ-eibis-2024-eu">surveyed</a> by the EIB Group are investing in the green transition, while 90% have taken measures to reduce GHG emissions. Reducing waste, lowering costs, and bolstering resilience make good business sense. It is this, more than international pressure, passionate rhetoric, and public commitments, that will encourage companies and investors to finance the decarbonization of the global economy. </p><p data-line-id="676a1fc1ef62457fb75ceef5e849dfab"> At the EIB Group, we commit more than half of our annual lending – nearly €50 billion ($53 billion) per year – to projects accelerating the green transition in Europe and beyond. Investing in climate resilience and adaption at home safeguards our infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods, and enables a robust, rapid recovery from disasters, such as the deadly floods that inundated entire towns in Central Europe in September and surged through my home country, Spain, in October. </p><p data-line-id="302548db27af404bb26bd372a93065fa"> But a successful transition is one that is both swift and just, ensuring that no one is left behind. Developing countries and low-income households are more vulnerable to the perils of global warming and the distributional impact of green-transition policies, as emerging technologies disrupt legacy industries and established business models. The EIB is therefore increasing its share of green investments outside the EU, supporting small island states at the front line of climate change, financing resilient infrastructure around the world, and fostering the global green-bond market. </p><p data-line-id="ba08d7c913da4ce6beb86b0de5ee4789"> Multilateral development banks have taken the lead on this front, investing a record <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2024-344-climate-finance-by-multilateral-development-banks-hits-record-in-2023">$125 billion</a> in green projects in 2023, and doubling the amount of private-sector finance mobilized compared to 2022. In addition to exceeding our pledges, we are committed to working together to continue mobilizing climate finance in the coming years. </p><p data-line-id="d3e4a0028be7468c84a31466633f4c0a"> Global cooperation is the only way to drive planetary-scale transformation. The green transition is underway, partly thanks to our joint efforts. But we must stay the course, building on existing international fora and decision-making frameworks to find win-win solutions that reinforce the security, stability, and well-being of all countries. </p>

<p data-line-id="7140e7f5785e4e1f9f3f0265b921a508"> WARSAW – Before the US presidential election, it seemed like no one but Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters believed he could win. After all, the man is a convicted felon, a putschist-provocateur, an agent of chaos, and a walking scandal who has been disowned by almost all his former advisers, some of whom describe him as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html">fascist</a>. Moreover, the incumbent Democratic administration presides over an economy with low inflation, low unemployment, high economic growth, a record-high stock market, and major new investments in infrastructure, technology, and green energy. Yet it happened. </p>

<p data-line-id="d01f32f7b0734580ad3923409f1d451a"> BAKU – Our world is at a critical juncture. The devastating effects of global warming are increasingly evident, and the crisis is deepening. To mitigate it, we must urgently reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions. Failing to act now will only increase the human and economic toll. </p><p data-line-id="27b234c2637543fbb15980835b221a04"> The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, presents a unique opportunity for effective collective action. Amid heightened geopolitical tensions and global uncertainty, COP29 will serve as a test of the multilateral system on which humanity’s ability to respond to this existential threat depends. </p><p data-line-id="9b9cdcd4fb194ed68f7d5c92caa0abdc"> The groundwork for coordinated action was laid in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 with the creation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which established the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to promote consensus-based solutions. The philosophy was simple: given that climate change is a global issue, addressing it requires a collaborative approach. </p><p data-line-id="fe4ed2d4a48d4d61a528c1f9a046eb85"> The UNFCCC fosters cooperation between smaller countries and superpowers, enables civil-society organizations to engage directly with governments, and facilitates cross-border technology transfers. Perhaps most importantly, it provides a framework for collective action in which each country’s efforts encourage others to step up their own. </p><p data-line-id="fe13718ba130402b9977e60358f0fe90"> While the 1997 Kyoto Protocol set binding emission-reduction targets for developed economies, it quickly became clear that more was needed. In response, developed countries pledged in 2009 to <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/climate-finance-and-the-usd-100-billion-goal.html">mobilize $100 billion</a> annually by 2020 to support developing countries’ climate policies. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="dbb4f5056c364e808f04fb92834c2202"> The 2015 Paris climate agreement marked a turning point, setting the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels and ensuring that the increase stays well below 2°C. To monitor progress, the agreement established a system of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) through which each country outlines its emission-reduction plans. Periodic global audits assess whether countries are on track to fulfill their climate commitments. </p><p data-line-id="7c2185daab694454aaf1bd5f482198a8"> Regrettably, the <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">first global audit</a>, released ahead of last year’s COP28 in Dubai, showed that we are far from meeting these climate targets. It also offered a comprehensive roadmap, calling on all countries to commit to NDCs aligned with the 1.5°C goal and establishing clear steps and timelines – including transitioning away from fossil fuels – that could bring the Paris agreement’s objectives within reach. </p><p data-line-id="87f490d8287041e291cc3a10740e342e"> COP29 represents the next step for the multilateral approach, with leaders expected to agree on a significant boost to the $100 billion climate finance target – the so-called <a href="https://unfccc.int/NCQG">New Collective Quantified Goal</a> (NCQG). Moreover, each country must submit its updated NDCs by February 2025. </p><p data-line-id="94da3c71aea74f44a7f5c9649233784e"> Transparency is essential to this process. If the Paris agreement’s targets are the destination, and the NDCs are the roadmap, the NCQG provides the fuel needed to get there. Building trust in countries’ commitment to bold climate action and willingness to provide the necessary financing is key. </p><p data-line-id="ae12334a8cca47e6b1a3dc008d914bde"> As COP29 President, Azerbaijan is urging all countries to submit NDCs aligned with the 1.5°C target as soon as possible. We are also doing everything we can to secure a fair and ambitious new climate-finance goal that addresses developing countries’ needs and matches the scale and urgency of the crisis. </p><p data-line-id="00ef4773b49a447a9b33daeecbe70c20"> Falling short would force us to confront tough questions: Are we willing to accept the failure of the Paris agreement? And what are the alternatives? One thing is clear: without a viable backup plan, we must do all we can to meet the 1.5°C goal. Sleepwalking into climate catastrophe is not an option. </p><p data-line-id="58e3043142af457c8fe52b2628801e9a"> To be sure, the multilateral system has its flaws. But it remains the best framework to tackle this daunting challenge. Over three decades, it has fostered lasting international cooperation, a shared understanding of the science, and a strong consensus concerning global climate goals. </p><p data-line-id="a9961f7b0b994bedaf59a81238ef286c"> The alternative to multilateralism is a fragmented response, with governments pursuing their own agendas without coordination or cooperation. This approach would mean slower progress, higher costs, and less equitable outcomes. Without a unifying goal, any sense of shared purpose would all but vanish. </p><p data-line-id="c8992f5ee3ec4ab894d7b7cd5dee6325"> Consider, for example, COP29’s objective of finalizing negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris agreement, which aims to standardize carbon markets. By channeling resources toward the most effective mitigation projects, this framework could save <a href="https://www.carbonpricingleadership.org/news1/2019/9/24/effective-article-6-trading-rules-could-save-up-to-250-billionyr-for-climate-action-by-2030-study-finds">$250 billion</a> annually by 2030 – a substantial boost in an era of limited resources. </p><p data-line-id="92a89ebccd8142a78d0e57c0ccb6e0f9"> Given the alternatives, we have no choice but to make the current system work. The COP29 Presidency will leave no stone unturned to achieve an international consensus. With an agenda focused on advancing transformative climate action, Azerbaijan could help bridge geopolitical divisions. But our success hinges on countries’ willingness to engage constructively and commit to the multilateral process. </p><p data-line-id="6ef48dcf87a8467ca8316b6967bc46ba"> The science is clear, the frameworks for coordinated action are in place, and the plan has been laid out. Now, we must find the political will to put these tools to use. COP29 is our chance to prove that multilateralism can work. </p>

<p data-line-id="b9717672d5a24e11ad2f8a45ca931b52"> CAMBRIDGE – China’s rise has challenged America’s undisputed hegemony over the world economy – a status the United States has enjoyed since the Soviet Union’s collapse. While some American national-security elites seek continued US primacy, others seem resigned to an increasingly bipolar world. A more likely outcome, however, is a multipolar world where middle powers exert considerable countervailing force, thus preventing the US and China from imposing their interests on others. </p>

<p data-line-id="ddeb21c3f5bc4445ae926cceb85fd068"> NEW YORK – Elections are supposed to clarify policy uncertainties, and on the economic front, Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris has done just that. All three major US stock indices and US Treasury yields <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-11-06-2024-2cb248af">jumped</a> the morning after Election Day, reflecting expectations of both strong economic growth and soaring debt and inflation. </p><p data-line-id="f74903fdfbd2484bbacde5ab65dda79a"> On climate and (especially) environmental policy, another Trump presidency is clearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/climate/2024-election-climate-change.html">bad news</a>, and it is exacerbated by extreme policy uncertainty and decidedly mixed signals, especially in cases where Trump may try to stand in the way of larger technological and market trends. </p><p data-line-id="695bc6be65b04f648ba75f21abdfcca0"> Consider electric vehicles (EVs). Casting himself as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99vlpkzk4no">champion</a> of the internal combustion engine, Trump says he will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-19/trump-vows-action-to-end-electric-vehicle-mandate-on-day-one">eliminate</a> tailpipe-emissions rules on “day one.” Doing so will be well within his power, and it may provide some life support for a waning industry. At the same time, Tesla’s stock <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stock-musk-trump-election-rivian-1086ba9f">jumped 15%</a> on the election news, with investors clearly betting the company will benefit from its CEO, Elon Musk, having spent more than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-wins-big-with-trump-bet-3c61ad90">$100 million</a> of his own money to help elect Trump. </p><p data-line-id="90dda231604747399351d2fffe59b514"> All this is happening at a time when EVs are demonstrating their fundamental superiority to the technology that has preceded them. EVs <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/01/electric-vehicles-use-half-the-energy-of-gas-powered-vehicles/">convert 90%</a> of their power into distance traveled, compared to only 20% for gasoline-powered vehicles. While the full efficiency gain depends on how much of the electricity is derived from renewables, even coal-fired power plants are more efficient than an internal combustion engine. In West Virginia, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/02/climate/electricity-generation-us-states.html">around 90%</a> of power comes from coal, an EV cuts carbon pollution by <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/09/electric-vehicles-reduce-carbon-pollution-in-all-u-s-states/">around 30%</a>. The US average efficiency gain is already around 50%, and rising. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="730f0dd806934bef84e50038d1813834"> Thus, basis physics dictates that any attempt by Trump to stand in the way of the EV transition is bound to fail. That said, he can still do a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/2024-us-election-what-trump-victory-would-mean-for-climate-energy-economic-security-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2024-09">lot of damage</a> along the way, especially when it comes to US competitiveness. US automakers already face stiff competition from China and elsewhere, and no US policy reversal on EVs or other clean technologies will curtail the rest of the world’s green industrial expansion. </p><p data-line-id="c12722b7184b431db9246a8ca101b5c6"> Already, over half of newly registered cars in China are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/more-than-half-of-new-cars-sold-in-china-are-now-electric-or-hybrid.html">EVs or plug-in hybrids</a> – more than twice the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-cars">global average</a>. The US is a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales">laggard</a>, and Trump’s victory all but ensures that it will remain one for some time to come. Imposing 10-20% <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-tariffs-would-hurt-business-and-workers-by-maurice-obstfeld-2024-10">tariffs on all imports</a>, and a 60% <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/economic-arguments-tariffs-trump/680015/">tariff on Chinese goods</a>, will not protect domestic manufacturers, as he claims. Trump already <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-officials-weigh-25-percent-tax-on-imported-cars-in-a-bid-to-force-concessions-in-nafta-trade-talks/2018/05/23/76e72172-5eca-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html">levied</a> a 25% tariff during his first presidency, and it did nothing to help US automakers prepare for the electric future; neither did the Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/opinion/biden-china-trade-electric-vehicles-solar-panels-tariffs.html">100% tariffs</a> on Chinese EVs. </p><p data-line-id="644fd97d37a9405792b069da08d2a6b8"> Trump’s efforts to halt the low-carbon transition may be even more futile when it comes to solar, wind, and other low-carbon technologies. Here, too, China dominates the global market, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-technology-perspectives-2024">producing</a> 97% of solar wafers, 85% of solar cells, and 80% of solar modules. That is why the Biden administration tried, with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA), to onshore some of the renewables supply chain by subsidizing domestic manufacturing. This resulted in projects like <a href="https://illuminateusa.com/press/a-new-era-of-manufacturing-pataskalas-illuminate-usa-starts-solar-panel-production/">Illuminate USA</a>, a joint venture with Chinese solar manufacturer LONGi in Pataskala, Ohio. The plant is expected to <a href="https://illuminateusa.com/press/pataskalas-massive-illuminate-usa-solar-plant-to-make-1000-panels-an-hour-when-complete/">assemble</a> more than nine million solar panels per year, enough to power a million American homes. </p><p data-line-id="0663a42e233747e399c85e9b8ed9ab9a"> The Trump administration may well want to continue the IRA’s production tax credit, which subsidizes around 25% of Illuminate’s costs. Either way, Trump’s approach will have implications mainly for the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/illuminate-usa-celebrates-one-thousand-illuminators-and-one-million-solar-panels-in-less-than-one-year-302218228.html">1,000 Ohioans</a> now employed by the plant. The effect on the global solar-panel market will be negligible; LONGi will simply find ways to manufacture the panels more cheaply elsewhere if it needs to. </p><p data-line-id="ddc7b00e7fa8465a8fb0744d62cbc258"> Of course, Trump can and will stand in the way of deploying renewables domestically as well. He has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-offshore-wind-execs-fret-privately-over-possible-trump-election-win-2024-10-31/">said</a> that he will <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-reelection-clean-energy-offshore-wind-inflation-reduction-act/732161/">halt offshore wind leases</a>; shares of turbine producers Ørsted and Vestas <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/european-clean-energy-stocks-tumble-trump-wins-presidency-2024-11-06/">lost</a> almost as much on the election news as Tesla gained. The Trump administration will also make it more difficult to connect new renewables to the grid, and try to extend the life of aging fossil-fuel infrastructure, while handing money to vested interests. But such tactics would merely delay the inevitable. </p><p data-line-id="0f365ea5f14946ddaa98ada9763c53ae"> During his first administration, Trump tried to revive the domestic coal sector. He failed. Coal had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/climate/trump-coal-politics.html">on its way out</a> long before he came to office, and the industry’s decline has only accelerated since then. The shift has been led by states like Texas, which recently <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/chart-whos-the-leader-in-utility-scale-solar-california-or-texas">surpassed</a> California in total utility-scale solar power installed. </p><p data-line-id="f1009b99d2ea427caa822d1b80b2765e"> Yes, Trump can and will do plenty of damage, including to public health through the rollback of environmental rules and safeguards. During his previous term, he rolled back <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-election-what-would-it-mean-for-climate-change-by-gernot-wagner-2024-03">more than 125</a> such rules, most of which were re-established under Biden. This time, he will be more ruthless and effective in ensuring that his reversals stick. In 2019, an <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32545-9/abstract">estimated 22,000 extra US deaths</a> were attributable to higher levels of local air pollution; such figures will become our new normal. </p><p data-line-id="53cadb9bb31840b4ab1175d3e5ab0473"> But Biden repaired the damage that Trump caused on the climate front, and then went further. The outgoing administration’s climate policies were even more ambitious than what US Senator Bernie Sanders proposed in his 2016 presidential platform. Biden’s strategy, anchored by the IRA, jump-started the green-tech race in the United States. Trump can and will handicap domestic industries in jockeying for positions in that global competition, but he cannot halt it. </p>

<p data-line-id="8e45eee2f83448b69e250df18dfdb648"> TEL AVIV – During the just-concluded US election campaign, I did not follow opinion polls, pore over “evidence-based” predictions, or read “expert” analyses of the race. As soon as I saw some of the most famous faces in American pop culture – from Taylor Swift and Beyoncé to Oprah Winfrey and Bruce Springsteen – campaigning for Vice President Kamala Harris, I knew she was going to lose. </p>

<p data-line-id="8998bead46474baeb6dd138bb3dae04d"> BAKU – From Bridgetown to Nairobi to Paris, no country is immune to the worsening effects of the climate crisis. With each passing year, we witness more climate-related destruction. In 2024, we have set a number of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biae087/7808595">new records</a>: wildfires in Chile have destroyed more than 14,000 homes; extreme rainfall in Brazil has devastated 478 cities and left nearly two million people stranded in Bangladesh; and in July the world experienced its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/24/record-hottest-day-earth-temperature-july">hottest day ever</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="372afc0660a44ca49792aa861d10e97a"> Africa has contributed only 3% of historical greenhouse-gas emissions, yet it endures some of the most severe climate-related disasters. These now cost the continent <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/cop28/focus-africa">$15 billion</a> per year, with climate-induced droughts and floods in 2023 causing food insecurity for more than 40 million Africans. </p>
<p data-line-id="fa396aefb4e9419ba1852acd43d7e0fe"> Convinced that no country should have to choose between fighting the climate crisis and combating poverty, we have decided to contribute to an ambitious reform of the international financial architecture. The <a href="https://pactedeparis.org/en.php">Paris Pact for People and the Planet</a>, the <a href="https://www.bridgetown-initiative.org/">Bridgetown Initiative</a>, and the <a href="https://www.afdb.org/sites/default/files/2023/09/08/the_african_leaders_nairobi_declaration_on_climate_change-rev-eng.pdf">Nairobi Declaration</a> each seek to provide one piece of the puzzle. Current international dynamics give us hope: many reform tracks have been opened up, and some have delivered results. That said, many more efforts are needed, and no options should be overlooked. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c2ade8b3ad24185aa4f61b382b60672"> One key piece is still underused: “solidarity levies.” Such policies are necessary to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to what should be a global effort. There are swaths of the economy which are largely under-taxed yet polluting the planet. This applies to maritime shipping, aviation, and, of course, the fossil-fuel industry, which enjoys low effective tax rates due to government subsidies (totaling an estimated <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2023/169/article-A001-en.xml">$7 trillion</a> in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund). </p>

<p data-line-id="d118a1c6c52d4484aa5518d9227e03fd"> These levies can contribute by allocating a share of the revenues to developing countries. A global levy of 0.1% on stock and bond trades could raise up to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3407855">$418 billion</a> per year. A levy on shipping of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide could raise <a href="https://www.iddri.org/sites/default/files/PDF/Publications/Catalogue%20Iddri/Autre%20Publication/202306-Note-shipping%20levy.pdf">$80 billion</a> per year. A levy on fossil-fuel extraction of $5 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> could raise <a href="https://www.stampoutpoverty.org/live2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CDT_guide_web23.pdf">$210 billion</a> per year. Even a partial redistribution through solidarity levies would guarantee a large source of predictable climate finance for these countries, thus complementing flows of official development assistance without amplifying existing debt burdens. </p>
<p data-line-id="413a5115b1604206b1ca259613476980"> The benefits would be significant. Despite Africa’s climate vulnerability, its vast potential to leverage renewable energy and critical minerals, and its role as a global carbon sink, the continent receives far less climate finance than <a href="https://www.afd.fr/en/actualites/closing-25-trillion-climate-gap-africa">it needs</a>. Solidarity levies could provide the funding needed to drive green development in Africa and around the world, especially in vulnerable low- and middle-income countries and small states with little fiscal room for building resilience or climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="a8bf6caa73164d4ab8e54c4558047aed"> These levies already exist. More than <a href="https://shs.hal.science/halshs-04087507/file/23009R_english.pdf">30 countries</a> currently implement a financial transaction tax, and at least 21 have a levy on airplane tickets. Moreover, even small-scale initiatives such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds demonstrate the feasibility of an international redistribution mechanism. To replicate and scale up these models requires further international cooperation to limit market distortions and preserve a level playing field. </p>
<p data-line-id="b0a89f7e64374e98ac1d1f604b6ae9a4"> To that end, we launched the <a href="https://globalsolidaritylevies.org/">Global Solidarity Levies Task Force</a> last year at COP28. With 13 member countries already, the task force has been examining the potential of levies across shipping, aviation, fossil fuels, and financial transactions, as well as exploring options like levies on plastic or cryptocurrency. In early 2025, we will publicly launch a handful of concrete proposals with rigorous impact assessments. These will be scalable – raising at least $100 billion per year – and accompanied by clear assessments of potential externalities.  </p>
<p data-line-id="6dbe5a71cf544bc88fda9cfe85fb1209"> As we head toward COP30 in Belém, Brazil, next year, political leadership will be essential to the initiative’s success. COP29 this month will provide the right opportunity to discuss our options and get on track for success. Our plan is to hold a special event for heads of state and government to marshal further support for our solidarity-levies coalition. This is a crucial opportunity to ensure that the United Nations’ <a href="https://unfccc.int/NCQG">New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance</a> incorporates solidarity levies and unlocks climate-finance flows that are both ambitious and equitable.  </p>
<p data-line-id="5307c2568c544dd98d2ad5f9b1370d2c"> When it comes to additional sources of finance, experts often allude to “innovative finance.” In the case of global solidarity levies, the only innovation required is ambitious leadership across a sufficient base of countries. Let the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement next year be remembered as the moment when we came together as a global community to implement solidarity levies, providing the financial tools necessary to meet the great challenge of our time. Ahead of COP29, we call on all governments to join our coalition, and we welcome the support of civil society, business leaders, and multilateral institutions. </p>

<p data-line-id="1684f44f8bee4505b2d99c050178c80e"> After the 2020 US election, it took days for major news networks to project the winner of the presidential race, and many more weeks for Americans – and the world – to know if there would be a peaceful and orderly transition of power. There wasn’t. The incumbent, Donald Trump, conspired to overturn the results, and then encouraged a mob of his followers to storm the US Capitol. </p><p data-line-id="08e69203b42e47a5a70e01ef1883c02d"> In 2024, Americans – and the world – have been spared that agonizing uncertainty, but will now confront instability in a more virulent form, because voters in the United States have handed Trump (now a convicted felon) and his party a decisive victory. How did it happen, and what does the outcome portend? Below, <em>Project Syndicate</em> commentators consider what another Trump presidency will mean for the US and global economies, domestic policy, and the future of democracy. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><h2 data-line-id="f53d490a881344c5bb867eab7cf72c7e"><strong>RUTH BEN-GHIAT</strong></h2><p data-line-id="114c4f8d7f314961a9ce5ed7dd0d8c77"> With Donald Trump’s desire to be a dictator so central to his persona and his political platform, the 2024 election was a referendum on whether Americans want to continue to live in a democracy, or prefer some form of “strongman” rule. They chose the latter.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3175763f47e846c1b36762a9a8e52f9b"> Of course, many who voted for Trump would say that they based their decision on his promise to bring down the price of eggs; because there are too many illegal immigrants in America; or because cities are overrun with crime and homeless people. But make no mistake: Trump’s campaign was a rehearsal for autocracy, featuring praise for foreign dictators as models of leadership, warnings about the “enemy within” (meaning his political opponents), and a depiction of America as a failed democratic experiment – the “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/trump-us-garbage-can-immigration/index.html">garbage can of the world</a>.” </p><p data-line-id="79acdf665a8a4c6b8545264a6015ab71"> Authoritarians often tell you what they are going to do – both as a means of intimidating those who would resist and to condition the broader public for what is coming. Based on what Trump has said, we should prepare for a declaration of a state of emergency on or around “Day One” (the codeword used by Trump’s MAGA movement and its policy blueprint, Project 2025, for an authoritarian takeover). The trumped-up justification could be (non-existent) threats from the “radical Marxist left,” (non-existent) “immigrant invasions,” or some (non-existent) conspiracy hatched by the Democratic “enemy within” and foreign “globalist warmongers.” </p><p data-line-id="5c9985e23bf74844b7dccfb8dc8ec7c2"> Under this state of exception, Trump’s bureaucratic “army” (Project 2025’s label for its cadre of politicized civil servants) can then be deployed to “dismantle the administrative state,” thus completing the destruction of America’s liberal democratic institutions of governance. Over time, there would be steady suppression of reproductive and voting rights; a constant threat of political violence; unrestrained oligarchic plunder of public resources; soaring economic inequality; investigations of critics that end with imprisonment (or perhaps execution by firing squad – a recurrent Trump fantasy); and perhaps deployment of the military against protesters and to carry out mass deportations.  </p><p data-line-id="ebde542b18fe4517b9ace592ae11e0fc"> These abuses are familiar from the history of authoritarianism. Now, America will experience them first-hand. </p><p data-line-id="9e9665300d6b4cf5a96d838a6f2efb52"><em>Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Professor of History and Italian Studies at New York University, is the author of </em><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324001546">Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present</a> <em>(W.W.

But these areas are not top priorities for much of the American public. Rather, voters have consistently reported to be most concerned with the economy. They asked, “Are we better off than we were four years ago” and answered with a firm “no.” This is itself remarkable, since in November 2020 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">COVID-19 deaths</a> were running at 10,000 per week, and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">unemployment</a> was 6.7%, versus 4.1% today. </p><p data-line-id="f12ce9dc022c4fc1b763875f164f077f"> One hears <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/explaining-disconnect-between-us-economic-performance-and-public-opinion-by-jeffrey-frankel-2024-02">various</a> <a href="https://www.jeffrey-frankel.com/2024/02/25/six-explanations-for-misperceptions-regarding-the-strong-economy/">explanations</a> for the public’s perception of poor economic performance. Perhaps the most common is the observation that inflation under Joe Biden has been higher than it was during Donald Trump’s first term. But most of the economic policies that Trump has campaigned on can be expected to put upward pressure on prices, assuming he follows through on them. These policies include challenges to the Federal Reserve’s independence and pressure for lower interest rates; depreciation of the dollar, to counter supposed undervaluation of trading partners’ currencies; large tax cuts that are not paid for, with the result that they widen the budget deficit; sharp increases in tariff rates, to 60% on all imports from China and up to 20% on all other imports; and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and restrictions on legal immigration. </p><p data-line-id="76c876f4fdef4a309556602808f89dc8"> If this prediction of higher inflation during the coming four years is borne out, will US voters take note? Will Trump supporters forget in 2028 how they voted in 2024? </p><p data-line-id="562c97ee892f4087be09ee865d98c3b0"><em>Jeffrey Frankel, Professor of Capital Formation and Growth at Harvard University, served as a member of President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. He is a research associate at the US National Bureau of Economic Research.</em></p><h2 data-line-id="9ae7da3e51bd48bb88923d1f924739bb"><strong>JAMES K. GALBRAITH</strong></h2><p data-line-id="1071ecdf6fe44ed0a2fab0e302f8fceb"> I went to bed early election night, unsurprised by the outcome. Among the reasons: prices, interest rates, wars, genocide, a case of dementia, and an empty campaign whose main theme was “Oh no! Not the other guy!” </p>

<p data-line-id="8d34606e995045e5b3e5903e1af185c9"> Donald Trump may be old, angry, and erratic, but he is not empty. Kamala Harris projected the void. Her presidency would have been in the hands of advisers – people like <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/paul-krugman">Paul Krugman</a> or Liz Cheney. If Harris had charted a course of her own, she might have won; but if she had been capable of that, Joe Biden would not have picked her for vice president four years ago. </p><p data-line-id="aafc47590cad455d8a68df9862bcbb23"> On the “glorious” economy, Krugman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/opinion/krugman-glorious-economy-harris.html">stated</a> the Democratic ticket’s case: Growth is “a remarkable success,” inflation “looks beaten,” and “claims that we have a bad economy are about as credible as claims that armed migrants have taken over Times Square.” There was just one problem: checking their kitchens and their bank accounts, it appears that millions of voters disagreed. </p><p data-line-id="9fa3892c706d443482edb1c4c129dca6"> Over at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, Thomas Ferguson makes <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/inet-research-and-the-2024-election">a strong argument</a>: Until the pandemic, the Trump years brought income gains for American workers, and COVID-19 relief reinforced those gains; but then price increases took them away. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve fed a “wealth-effect” boom in consumption by the rich, and then high interest rates froze the housing market for everyone else. </p><p data-line-id="2a7461e9fc654b80a1636b7041a5e1ad"> The great mystery of this election, as of now, is that Trump’s overall vote barely changed from 2020 to 2024, while the drop-off from Biden to Harris was around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/us-presidential-election-2024-briefing-donald-trump-kamala-harris">13 million</a> votes (from 81 to 68 million). That’s a huge – and very unbalanced – change. What happened? We don’t know, but the question should be posed and answered. </p><p data-line-id="71c61ccf6b5b4509b56d56c617cea82c"><em>James K.

But there is nothing odd, or incoherent, about saying that a democratic choice can undermine democracy – the twentieth century saw a lot of that. It is entirely possible for a polity to choose a candidate or party that has demonstrated, and then loudly reiterated, its refusal to abide by the established rules of democratic competition, and its determination to use the awesome power of the government to overwhelm or handicap its opponents.  </p><p data-line-id="e3494f0b4b084ee39567f275cbfd2ca8"> The now thoroughly Trumpian Republican Party has shown no hesitation in using rhetoric and violence that scorns the idea of mutual tolerance and forbearance. Expect that political movement to entrench itself in, and transform, the federal government into a tool not just for its policies but more generally for its enduring hegemony. Expect the rule of law to be bent increasingly into an instrument for turning whim into command, without any prospect that power will be bridled in ways that make it predictable rather than arbitrary. </p><p data-line-id="2f319289c69445ecac8b3e7fdd12a186"> There will be talk in the coming weeks or months about whether America’s democratic institutions are likely to prove resilient. It is important to observe that these institutions have already failed an important test: There are a range of legal mechanisms that are meant to prevent an incumbent president from violating the public’s trust, and existing laws, to stay in power. Impeachment, disqualification for “insurrection” or “rebellion,” and criminal prosecution – all failed. They failed as a means to bolt in the rule of law. And they failed as signals of unfitness for office. </p><p data-line-id="1e627bf493004a7ba7fd984260677eb8"> On the back of that failure, the public has now repudiated those votes against Donald Trump by using their own votes to re-elect him. What remains may be resilient, but whether it is enough to count as “democracy” remains to be seen. </p><p data-line-id="e9bf33312abc4d7d8d25ccd81410d3ae"><em>Aziz Huq, Professor of Law at the University of Chicago, is the author of </em><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-collapse-of-constitutional-remedies-9780197556818">The Collapse of Constitutional Remedies</a><em> (Oxford University Press, 2021).</em></p><h2 data-line-id="0cac4f4fed4b404bad7a739699f6769b"><strong>HAROLD JAMES</strong></h2><p data-line-id="00f1486fe48f4694b8a8a5742d528dd8"> Donald Trump and the Republicans have decisively won a free and fair election. Democracy is very good at picking up on voters’ most passionate concerns. Americans were worried about inflation and immigration, and though democracy was also a big issue, the manner in which Vice President Kamala Harris was installed as the Democratic Party’s nominee following President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race did raise eyebrows. The Democrats will undoubtedly engage in a painful postmortem of the failure to insist on a more democratic nominating process at their Chicago convention. </p><p data-line-id="939ac30308654105bcfca9e3973b97dc"> Unfortunately, though democracy is good at highlighting anxieties, it is not necessarily good at producing the best remedies. Americans are worried about price increases, but Trump’s proposed tariffs would make many goods even more expensive. Appliances, electronics, and clothing will all cost more, and American farmers – a key constituency in some states – will be hit hard when other countries retaliate. Everyone, including America, will suffer from a trade war. </p><p data-line-id="a003e99e7f8b45e5b2201b5f93724568"> Trade has been a central concern for Trump since the 1980s, when he was passionate about a supposed Japanese threat to take over the world. But this was always a blinkered view of the economic transformation that occurred in the late twentieth century, and Trump’s zero-sum mentality will do nothing to help Americans today. Similarly, his threat to expel undocumented immigrants – many of them employed in jobs Americans won’t do – is unlikely to reduce price pressures or create more jobs for US citizens. </p><p data-line-id="2c633f5041794ce994e8117725f7951a"> The new administration will inevitably blame the US Federal Reserve, rather than its own policies, for any renewed monetary turbulence. Meanwhile, the fiscal legacy of the global financial crisis, Trump’s first term, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Biden’s own spending policies will remain. Without a clear, coherent fiscal plan, a rising share of the budget will go toward debt service unless the administration succeeds in bullying the Fed to hold down interest rates. But if that happens, we can expect far higher inflation, and we can say goodbye to the dollar’s dominant position in the world financial system. </p><p data-line-id="5b1e71144ae4496c814bd28776887490"><em>Harold James, Professor of History and International Affairs at Princeton University, is the author, most recently, of </em><a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300263398/seven-crashes/">Seven Crashes: The Economic Crises That Shaped Globalization</a><em> (Yale University Press, 2023).</em></p><h2 data-line-id="4fd1646cdacb4407a33496e8dfe5f2ed"><strong>CHARLES A. KUPCHAN</strong></h2><p data-line-id="bda15faf2af04ca6bba181d847316339"> Donald Trump’s decisive victory answers, at least for now, a central question that was looming over the election: Will the political center hold? The answer, clearly, is no – and not just in the United States. Trump’s win does not auger well for the political center globally, including in Europe, where the ideological extremes continue to gain ground. Many of the world’s democracies appear headed for a prolonged period of polarization and illiberal populism, with the US leading the way. </p><p data-line-id="111a2b9a350b4a20ade66f61edbd7812"> Trump’s return to power should therefore serve as a wake-up call, prompting urgent efforts to tackle the factors that have hollowed out political centrism and fueled the growth of a strident populism. Those steps must address two key challenges. </p><p data-line-id="bf9ee7b464914e279254f5f74d51a655"> First, in the aftermath of the erosion of the social contract of the industrial era, the US needs to rebuild its middle class. Trump has promised to do so, turning to protective tariffs aimed at turning the US back into a “manufacturing powerhouse.” But protectionist barriers would not only risk blowing up the global economy; they would also fail to solve the problem. </p><p data-line-id="ed3ae2b60e4d4e789370d46ef1c57421"> In an era of digitization and automation, the scale of any conceivable manufacturing turnaround will not come close to what would be required to return a broad swath of working Americans to the middle class. Instead, the US government needs to work with the private sector to fashion an education and employment ecosystem that will enable working Americans to earn a living wage as automation, artificial intelligence, and other technologies evolve. Much of this effort needs to focus on creating and filling well-paid jobs in the service sector, where most Americans will work – and where roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/270072/distribution-of-the-workforce-across-economic-sectors-in-the-united-states/">80%</a> of the US workforce is already employed. The same goes for other advanced economies. </p><p data-line-id="7d51c949c93e4342a50588b46252e6ef"> Second, Trump needs to work with Congress to overhaul the nation’s broken immigration system. The influx of migrants across the southern border has been a major source of both polarization and electoral discontent. It is past time to enact legislation that secures the border, establishes an orderly and streamlined system for processing legal immigration, and charts a humane pathway for resolving the status of millions of undocumented migrants. Many other democracies, particularly in Europe, similarly need to tackle immigration reform. </p><p data-line-id="46ce0432eb474622a3936dd9b83d8ba0"> As for the global impact of his return to power, Trump promises to be far more unilateralist than isolationist. The world should be ready for a fiercely transactional foreign policy; foreign leaders should understand that they will be dealing with a real-estate mogul, not a statesman. Allies will need to spend more on their own defense to stay in Trump’s good graces. Ukraine had better get ready to seek a diplomatic endgame to its fight against Russian aggression. Israel may have a freer hand as it seeks to take down the “axis of resistance,” but it had better ready a postwar peace plan that will be to Trump’s liking. Allies and adversaries alike should get ready for a raft of new US tariffs, but they may be able to negotiate trade deals that strike Trump’s fancy, thereby helping prevent the fragmentation of the global economy. </p><p data-line-id="51d8c6b2f420487ab6db0e810f902206"> Trump won a commanding victory. We may lament that outcome, but we need to try to make the most of it. </p><p data-line-id="969d0ffbaf8a4961a3565a6169405c3c"><em>Charles A. Kupchan, Professor of International Affairs at Georgetown University and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, served on the National Security Council under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.</em></p><h2 data-line-id="8298bab7f27d496c806a67060cb30c98"><strong>CARLA NORRLÖF</strong></h2><p data-line-id="81115552394d4115872b663b2fb6f337"> The economy was a major issue in this election, but it operated within a broader context in which perceived leadership qualities and demographic factors contributed to Donald Trump’s success. Exit polls <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0">indicate</a> that 52% of voters trust Trump more to handle the economy, a perspective likely bolstered by positive income growth across all income groups during his previous tenure. Moreover, Trump was overwhelmingly favored among the 30% of voters who value a candidate with the “ability to lead,” and among the 28% who want someone who “can bring needed change.”  </p><figure data-line-id="ad2902a76f274e71b63a34996af358f5"><img data-image="nl752skoxip7" src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/7c6d7f79bbeb5d6f090418edcd3e3500.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="d388a90046464d2bb3936915230a8a0b"> Many Americans vote their wallets. The bottom income quintile (those earning less than $30,000 per year) has experienced higher income growth under Joe Biden, and favored Kamala Harris. Voters in the second and third quintiles ($30,000-$99,999) experienced higher income growth during Trump’s previous administration, and favored Trump this time. Inflation likely eroded the purchasing power of their gains, leading to economic dissatisfaction. Among voters who felt that their family’s financial situation is worse now than four years ago, 81% supported Trump, suggesting that subjective perceptions of economic hardship may have outweighed actual income statistics. </p><p data-line-id="534d1fa5897b40f1ad7f243d440130a0"> Harris also faced unique challenges that may have affected voters’ perception of her. The scrutiny she encountered overshadowed her substantive contributions and messaging on issues like immigration, health care, and equity. Media narratives often <a href="https://www.readingthepictures.org/2024/03/the-disappearing-of-kamala-harris/">underreported</a> her achievements, while focusing on controversies or perceived shortcomings. As in 2016, Trump relied on simple, catchy language and anecdotes to tap into voters’ anxieties about the economy and immigration. He was well positioned to promise a return to the income growth that was achieved during his first term, and to respond forcefully to what are generally agreed to be significant challenges on the southern border. </p><p data-line-id="da6d264c86bd422ea37d3b5ff238407d"> Trump also ruthlessly attacked Harris’s credibility and relied on racist and sexist stereotypes – going so far as to call her “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/21/trump-harris-dumb-stupid-low-iq/">stupid</a>” and “low IQ.” And yet he has faced numerous indictments and allegations related to sexual misconduct, tax fraud, obstruction of justice, election interference, and incitement of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. It is a testament to his extraordinary ability to evade any consequences that voters nonetheless perceive him as a credible leader. </p><p data-line-id="3c8183f60a274af99031656ba1d29143"><em>Carla Norrlöf, Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto, is a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.</em></p><h2 data-line-id="23451e2d6f0f4b15965e4a69f1a4745f"><strong>CECILIA ELENA ROUSE</strong></h2><p data-line-id="84d263af5cc9495b95b22024fb06a095"> Based on his campaign, Donald Trump’s economic agenda will center on extending some or all of the expiring 2017 tax cuts, reducing other individual and business taxes, strengthening national defense, and addressing immigration. If you add in other campaign proposals (including some that would raise revenue), the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans">estimates</a> that Trump’s agenda would add $7.75 trillion to the United States’ projected national debt through 2035. This would be on top of the $26 trillion of debt already held by the public, which the Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/ranking-member/newsroom/press/cbo-national-debt-to-reach-record-share-of-gdp-in-just-three-years">estimates</a> will increase to more than $50 trillion by 2034 even without Trump’s proposals. </p><p data-line-id="d56e532728424e9b95ca56a71f24cafd"> The US federal government does not have an official “budget constraint,” but such a large federal debt burden will certainly fuel pressure to cut spending. The question is what and where to cut. In 2023, discretionary spending – such as outlays for defense, transportation, veterans’ benefits, and education – comprised only about one-quarter of the budget. This is spending that must be appropriated each year and is negotiated as part of the budget process. Most of the spending is on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security (as well as a few others), which are mandated by law. Without completely gutting discretionary spending, there is not enough room to enact Trump’s desired agenda and have an appropriately sized federal budget. </p><p data-line-id="209c050005e543c0a7b5431a2753cd04"> And how to make space for new priorities? Unless policymakers are willing to reform entitlement programs and find additional sources of revenue, there will be very little fiscal space for policies needed to boost economic productivity – such as by investing in new infrastructure or finding ways to support an aging workforce. Furthermore, increasing the US federal debt promises to be inflationary, which will exacerbate many Americans’ economic woes. Trump will face many challenges during his second term, and policymakers can address them only if they have some fiscal breathing room to launch reforms. </p><p data-line-id="793bd3784dd14a1ea65cc856cd76c8b5"><em>Cecilia Elena Rouse, former chair of US President Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, is President of the Brookings Institution.</em></p><h2 data-line-id="3f40469cee7947b2a4db0a10f722ac7f"><strong>ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER</strong></h2><p data-line-id="5eb3e3aa6c494648aff5a6616b5aa8c4"> In 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency on a platform of hope and change, running on a political manifesto entitled <em>The Audacity of Hope </em>and a theme song called “Yes We Can.” Kamala Harris tried the same strategy this year, looking forward and trying to turn the page on an era of division and growing hate. This time fear triumphed over hope. </p><p data-line-id="fbb858d935ee4b788fc5428835674774"> The majority of Americans are just too angry. Men are angry that they are being pushed aside, losing their traditional roles of breadwinner, protector, and leader. Young people are angry that they cannot afford the middle-class lifestyle – a house, children, cars, and vacations – that their parents had. Rural Americans are deeply angry at the elites on the coasts and in the big cities, the people in power who dismiss them as uneducated and provincial. </p><p data-line-id="216134882a144e27b2f482cbd87877b2"> Americans across the country are angry at prices – for groceries, transportation, medication, childcare, and other necessities – that have often reached absurd levels and make it impossible to live the way they once did. Uber and Lyft introduced themselves a decade ago as alternatives to expensive taxis; today even short rides cost between $30 and $50 in many cities. Americans who are experiencing rapid demographic change are angry at the immigrants whom they perceive to be taking over and remaking the country. </p><p data-line-id="e8cbfe4d8b0f444c9cececebdc560029"> Women are angry too, at losing control of their own bodies. But their anger was not enough to turn the tide. </p><p data-line-id="635e42acd58e41bbbe6f786953b30797"> Anger often reflects fear, and there is plenty to be afraid of in a deeply uncertain and violent world. It also reflects the persistent sense that America itself – its infrastructure, health system, borders, and the political system – is broken. Notwithstanding Joe Biden’s many successes, Donald Trump’s dark visions captured the national mood. He won as an angry battering ram of change, aimed at the system itself. </p><p data-line-id="722fd457d48142cb8d6b53ddc00162b2"><em>Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning in the US State Department, is CEO of the think tank New America, Professor Emerita of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, and the author of </em><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691210568/renewal">Renewal: From Crisis to Transformation in Our Lives, Work, and Politics</a><em>(Princeton University Press, 2021).</em></p><h2 data-line-id="830d9fd5c5d94fdc99f7f1781a870588"><strong>LAURA TYSON</strong></h2><p data-line-id="c2015b97bd154ee391087c627684ec31">On most macroeconomic indicators – GDP growth, unemployment, (declining) inflation, business investment, the stock market, and real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth – the US economy is the envy of the world. Yet millions of voters in red (Republican-leaning) and blue (Democratic) states and across demographic groups voted for Donald Trump, because they are deeply angry that the economy has not delivered for them. They want a change in direction – an economy that delivers gains for everyone.</p><p data-line-id="48097ec9c2bc413cb788cbdb88073f92">But, under Trump, they will not get what they want. They will get tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich, paid for by eviscerating cuts to the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other key middle-class programs. They will get larger federal budget deficits, and thus higher interest rates. They will get big across-the-board increases in tariffs that drive up prices, particularly for low- and middle-income consumers. The overall US economy will be dragged down by a stronger dollar, retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners, and the business uncertainty resulting from Trump’s plans to upend the rules and change or terminate programs across all major government agencies. Trump’s economic agenda is a recipe for stagflation and growing wage and income inequality.</p><p data-line-id="9ad79187c31848868c9b0a42db3ae4b5">Moreover, the Republicans’ plan to curtail reproductive rights for women will have negative <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/economy-wide-impact-of-reproductive-freedom-by-laura-tyson-2024-09">economic consequences</a> for women and their families. Despite historic storms and fires, Trump will walk away from the Inflation Reduction Act’s effective, business-friendly incentives to advance the clean-energy transition (even though red states have benefited disproportionately from these policies). In economic relations with China, Trump might adopt a “transactional art-of-the-deal” approach, negotiating bilateral agreements that reduce the US trade deficit. His oligarchic backer, Elon Musk, will do everything he can to keep Tesla’s Chinese competitors out of the US electric-vehicle market. That will keep prices high and slow the transition to EVs – a transition that is essential to curb carbon emissions and limit global warming.</p><p data-line-id="46ce675eb7e54fda8b84c7af461cea18">At the same time that he squanders US leadership on this key national-security and global challenge, he will likely give Russian President Vladimir Putin whatever he wants in Ukraine, and he will greenlight Binyamin Netanyahu’s plans to pursue armed conflict with Iran and kill off the prospect of a two-state solution. As he walks away from, or sharply limits America’s role in, NATO, Europeans will be on their own.</p><p data-line-id="e411ae0c49d346d18f0fb97a4e613192"><em>Laura Tyson, a former chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the Board of Advisers at Angeleno Group.</em><em><br/></em></p>

<p data-line-id="8ce52b9266e64a3cbc76aee242801992"> LONDON – While the world’s attention has been on the US election, the rising number of extreme weather events – from disastrous flooding in Spain to southern Africa’s worst drought in a century – highlights the need to remain focused on climate change, biodiversity loss, and a <a href="https://watercommission.org/">changing water cycle</a>.  </p><p data-line-id="2366a7c078a34a4cb88cbf87a6378058"> These crises are related, and the symptoms are getting worse. When drought kills crops, millions of people suffer; and when water extremes (too much or too little) hit vulnerable societies, the resulting displacements, migration, and conflicts can affect everyone.  </p><p data-line-id="05915492b63e45b59028443b778e79f2"> Yet no one is listening. The recent COP16 biodiversity summit in Cali, Colombia, received little international attention, and failed to produce a roadmap to ramp up funding for species protection. Instead, delegates merely celebrated their decision to charge private companies for the use of genetic biodiversity information, and to establish a new working group for indigenous peoples. </p><p data-line-id="899f4211502a4fe99c73afab77163e56"> While important, these developments are marginal in relation to the task of halting biodiversity loss. Worse, they could serve as a smokescreen for global inaction, just as we have seen over the years in global climate negotiations, where long sessions on trade and “loss and damage” obscured the lack of action on phasing out fossil fuels. Although the Global Biodiversity Framework – adopted in Montreal in 2022 – established ambitious targets to protect 30% of the planet by 2030, 158 countries still <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/31/alarm-grows-over-disturbing-lack-of-progress-revealed-at-biodiversity-summit-cop16">have not submitted</a> formal plans on how they will do their part. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="252a2a1229d2486b8f65cad993b49125"> This inaction cannot continue. Human activities are threatening the stability of the climate and the natural systems upon which human well-being depends. Food security, human health, and social stability are all on the line. The COP16 negotiations are supposed to continue “<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20241102-cop16-ends-no-agreement-funding-roadmpa-increase-protect-species">at a later date</a>”; but the world cannot afford to let COP16 pass without significant progress toward protecting our planet’s biodiversity and ecosystems. </p><p data-line-id="1b029cf08ed7450f9ac4b3e862bdf9d7"> Without <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/water-security-crisis-nature-of-the-problem-and-what-to-do-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2024-09-1-2024-09">urgent, systemic, collective action</a>, the effects of climate change, biodiversity loss, and the water crisis will only intensify. Biodiversity and nature are central to maintaining stable climate patterns and the hydrological cycle. Wetlands and forests, which store huge amounts of carbon, rely on stable water cycles and thriving biodiversity to function effectively.  </p><p data-line-id="72291d9e214940d89a2fa914d39eb23e"> Similarly, terrestrial ecosystems currently absorb <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/projects-statistics/science-stories/richer-understanding-terrestrial-carbon-cycles-aids-more">25%</a> of carbon dioxide emissions, helping to prevent atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from rising beyond 420 parts per million. Yet extreme hydrological events – droughts and floods, combined with heat during the 2023 “super El Niño” cycle – eroded this massive carbon sink substantially. This was a serious warning sign. Unchecked biodiversity loss alone could cause us to exceed the Paris climate agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5° Celsius, with dire consequences for vulnerable communities worldwide. </p><p data-line-id="814a8aee52734fccb75cb9e9fcb04051"> In our <a href="https://economicsofwater.watercommission.org/">final report</a> for the <a href="https://watercommission.org/">Global Commission on the Economics of Water</a>, we <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/water-security-crisis-nature-of-the-problem-and-what-to-do-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2024-09">show</a> how interconnected our world is not just through the blue water in our rivers and lakes, but also through “green water” in soil moisture. Moreover, we are all connected through “atmospheric rivers”: moisture transported from the soil, through plants and forests, to the atmosphere, where it flows between regions to provide essential rainfall. </p><p data-line-id="8ba371b3c39d4af5b10273c0947c929f"> Healthy vegetation is the backbone of this process, transpiring water into the atmosphere to generate clouds. Some countries benefit disproportionately from these atmospheric rivers, while others, like India and Brazil, are significant exporters of moisture. Almost half of global rainfall depends on neighboring land use, underscoring the importance of conserving healthy ecosystems worldwide. </p><p data-line-id="531d9c968d1f4d7f83a2136117aa1170"> The costs of inaction are enormous. A destabilized hydrological cycle implies <a href="https://watercommission.org/">far-reaching economic damage</a>. Changing precipitation patterns, rising temperatures, reduced water storage, and declining access to clean water augur significant GDP losses. High-income countries face an average GDP contraction of 8% by 2050, and lower-income countries could suffer drops of up to 15%. At the same time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/16/global-water-crisis-food-production-at-risk">over half (55%) of the world’s food production</a> is now in areas with dwindling freshwater supplies. </p><p data-line-id="76eb5110bc2b4957950e0fe436ea6f2e"> We can still turn the tide on the global water crisis, but only by protecting and restoring declining ecosystems. As the commission’s report notes, a good starting point is for governments to adopt a clear set of mission-driven policies to “[c]onserve and restore natural habitats critical to protect green water.” <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2024/jul/mission-oriented-industrial-strategy-global-insights">Mission-driven policies</a> that recognize the interdependencies between water and biodiversity are needed to foster the <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-water-crisis-bad-economics-ignores-externalities-rewards-pillaging-by-mariana-mazzucato-et-al-2023-12">all-of-government and economy-wide</a> responses that planetary sustainability requires. </p><p data-line-id="9708c43e48264192b6d0765cce55c676"> For example, a mission to “restore at least 30% of degraded forest and inland water ecosystems globally by 2030” would require sectors as diverse as agriculture, forestry, construction, and information and communication technologies (to name a few) to work together. A mission to restore forests is not just for the environment ministry, but also for the finance, agriculture, and science and technology ministries, among others. </p><p data-line-id="f8effc629dac4cb08a21f17d3473ccd5"> Governments have a chance to demonstrate this level of ambition and make meaningful progress when COP16 negotiations resume. First, they must submit formal plans on how they will meet the Global Biodiversity Framework targets. Second, national biodiversity strategies and action plans that set priorities and direct financing streams must recognize the importance of green water. </p><p data-line-id="b619afa1fc4243a6bcff3ce0aeef9a4b"> Third, governments must do more to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples, who are stewards of <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/07/indigenous-peoples-control-one-quarter-of-worlds-land-surface-two-thirds-of-that-land-is-essentially-natural/">one-quarter</a> of the planet’s land and about 40% of the remaining natural lands worldwide. While COP16 delegates did agree that companies should compensate local and indigenous communities for the use of genetic information drawn from the biodiversity they help safeguard, the compensation thresholds should be more ambitious. </p><p data-line-id="2742d3ec169845eaa8cb79157d6da738"> Tokenistic smokescreens are not evidence of a successful summit. We cannot afford to lose a decade of action on biodiversity. The world’s access to freshwater depends on governments doing more right now. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="61ca07d95e594a10b150a9cc21f98fb9"> NEW YORK – Like others, since late Tuesday night, my phone has been blaring with text messages asking how this could have happened (as some of my friends, colleagues, and acquaintances know, I had been fully convinced that Donald Trump would win this election handily). Instead of responding in detail to every message, I will offer my explanation here. </p>
<p data-line-id="16c57dd7913e4a2abc0ccda20c7cdeb7"> For 2,300 years, at least since Plato’s <em>Republic</em>, philosophers have known how demagogues and aspiring tyrants win democratic elections. The process is straightforward, and we have now just watched it play out. </p>
<p data-line-id="34e8dd78963240fd99dc1ce2a4cb5b7a"> In a democracy, anyone is free to run for office, including people who are thoroughly unsuitable to lead or preside over the institutions of government. One telltale sign of unsuitability is a willingness to lie with abandon, specifically by representing oneself as a defender against the people’s perceived enemies, both external and internal. Plato regarded ordinary people as being easily controlled by their emotions, and thus susceptible to such messaging – an argument that forms the true foundation of democratic political philosophy (as I have argued in previous <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691173429/how-propaganda-works">work</a>). </p>
<p data-line-id="e2fe75550443470b88a9762aa053ebb8"> Philosophers have also always known that this kind of politics is not necessarily destined to succeed. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued, democracy is at its most <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290657939_Rousseau's_social_contract_An_introduction">vulnerable</a> when inequality in a society has become entrenched and grown too glaring. Deep social and economic disparities create the conditions for demagogues to prey on people’s resentments, and for democracy ultimately to fall in the way that Plato described. Rousseau thus concluded that democracy requires widespread equality; only then can people’s resentments not be exploited so easily.  </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="fcb5e1134900415ead134a4dc6d79133"> In my own work, I have tried to describe, in minute detail, why and how people who feel slighted (materially or socially) come to accept pathologies – racism, homophobia, misogyny, ethnic nationalism, and religious bigotry – which, under conditions of greater equality, they would reject. </p>
<p data-line-id="a819ce6e331d446f80566688e4411836"> And it is precisely those material conditions for a healthy, stable democracy that the United States lacks today. If anything, America has come to be singularly defined by its massive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/29/rich-poor-gap-wealth-inequality-bernie-sanders">wealth inequality</a>, a phenomenon that cannot but undermine social cohesion and breed resentment. With 2,300 years of democratic political philosophy suggesting that democracy is not sustainable under such conditions, no one should be surprised by the outcome of the 2024 election. </p>
<p data-line-id="d166e83ac3014df98c7af5c0a803e295"> But why, one might ask, has this not already happened in the US? The main reason is that there had been an unspoken agreement among politicians not to engage in such an extraordinarily divisive and violent form of politics. Recall the 2008 election. John McCain, the Republican, could have appealed to racist stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth, but he refused to take this path, famously <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/mccain-defends-obama-arab-2008-campaign-john/4058948/">correcting</a> one of his own supporters when she suggested that the Democratic candidate was a foreign-born “Arab.” McCain lost, but he is remembered as an American statesperson of unimpeachable integrity. </p>
<p data-line-id="26702f52c45849a2896e8349e4d10ce6"> Of course, American politicians regularly appeal more subtly to racism and homophobia to win elections; it is, after all, a successful strategy. But the tacit agreement not to conduct such a politics explicitly – what the political theorist Tali Mendelberg calls the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691070711/the-race-card">norm of equality</a> – ruled out appealing too openly to racism. Instead, it had to be done through hidden messages, dog whistles, and stereotypes (such as by talking about “laziness and crime in the inner city”). </p>
<p data-line-id="0666ac7a30754c6187d89a5d19b86b76"> But under conditions of deep inequality, this coded brand of politics eventually becomes less effective than the explicit kind. What Trump has done since 2016 is throw out the old tacit agreement, labeling immigrants as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/16/trump-immigrants-new-hampshire-rally">vermin</a> and his political opponents as “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/01/trumps-enemies-within-list">the enemies within</a>.” Such an explicit “us versus them” politics, as philosophers have always known, can be highly effective. </p>
<p data-line-id="281eb7c636cc4fb886e597722b445619"> Democratic political philosophy, then, has been correct in its analysis of the Trump phenomenon. Tragically, it also offers a clear prediction of what will come next. According to Plato, the kind of person who campaigns this way will rule as a tyrant.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3755ba49900f4e2ca69dd6cba2269f4b"> From everything Trump has said and done during this campaign and in his first term, we can expect Plato to be vindicated once again. The Republican Party’s domination of all branches of government would render the US a one-party state. The future may offer occasional opportunities for others to vie for power, but whatever political contests lie ahead most likely will not qualify as free and fair elections. </p>

<p data-line-id="4bc378609fbe4e03a256fb988dc90663"> LONDON – Donald Trump’s re-election as US president is a devastating shock to Europe, which is woefully unprepared. Trump’s promised protectionism threatens the European Union’s struggling export-led economies, and his transactional attitude toward NATO endangers Europe’s already feeble security. Ukraine could soon be sacrificed to Russia, and by emboldening nationalist fellow-travelers such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Trump may cause EU unity to be further undermined from within. </p>

<p data-line-id="6540395d97674c42b47e284260c5ee2e"> TOKYO – Last month, returning to Japan for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, I was struck by how significantly prices had increased. In February 2020, a simple lunch in downtown Tokyo cost about JP¥1,000, then the equivalent of about $10; today, it costs more like JP¥2,000. To some extent, this mirrors the experience in the United States, where, even as inflation moderates, prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. The difference is that Japan has also experienced a sharp currency depreciation, which benefits foreign visitors: that JP¥2,000 bill translated to just $13. </p>

<p data-line-id="857a1345baab4a988387c5408ef0526d"> PARIS – Solar power has been the star of the clean-energy transition, delivering major benefits for the climate, the cost of living, and energy security. With an average annual growth rate of almost <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/renewable-energy-progress-tracker">30%</a> over the last decade, the market for solar power has undergone a rapid transformation. What was once a heavily subsidized renewable-energy technology is now a readily available mainstream solution – whether one needs to power skyscrapers in large cities or deliver electricity to small businesses in rural areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="9edbf6a409544010b37c013c31176850"> Solar has become an increasingly attractive option for electricity producers and consumers alike. In 2023, additions to the world’s renewable power capacity <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023/electricity">grew by 50%</a>, and most of that was solar PV. With <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables">supportive policies</a> already in place in more than 130 countries, solar power looks set to continue playing its starring role for the rest of this decade. Compared with the previous five years, solar PV deployment through 2030 is expected to more than double in major economies such as the United States, China, the European Union, India, and Brazil.  </p>
<p data-line-id="ed2ebbc9c99545869be9fc4596de3a47"> Falling costs have been a key driver of this growth, with solar-panel prices <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2024/executive-summary">declining</a> by almost 50% in 2023. The combination of lower costs, scalable manufacturing, and quick installation means that solar PV is cheaper than new fossil-fuel power plants in most markets. Moreover, the benefits of solar can be amplified when paired with energy storage such as batteries or connected to larger, flexible systems via grids to deliver reliable power supplies. </p>
<p data-line-id="866ad44499534d5499b336ac379a1b3e"> Still, despite the unprecedented growth of solar power in recent years, the world needs to <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/global-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-pledge">triple</a> its renewable-energy capacity by 2030. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) last year, all countries agreed that meeting this goal is necessary to keep the 1.5º Celsius target for global warming within reach. The task for policymakers is to provide regulatory certainty for the private sector; ramp up investments in solar and other renewables, electricity storage, and grid infrastructure; cut red tape and remove administrative barriers; and improve access to finance, particularly for projects in emerging and developing economies. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="In PS on Sunday, PS editors curate a selection of the past week’s most relevant, incisive, and powerful commentaries, so that you have all of the information you need as you head into the new workweek." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS on Sunday" data-link-name="newsletter-weekly" data-newsletter="prosyn-weekly-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="bfe69ee8618f49d289b984531e299183"> Fortunately, even high inflation and tightening supply chains have not prevented the cost of solar PV from falling dramatically. But since this trend is largely due to China’s massive investments in solar-panel production, the international solar supply chain has become highly concentrated. As the growth of solar PV continues, manufacturing will need to become more diversified to ensure resilient supply chains. Initiatives such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, India’s <a href="https://www.investindia.gov.in/production-linked-incentives-schemes-india">Production-Linked Incentive</a>, and the EU’s Net-Zero Industry Act will be crucial to building and revitalizing homegrown clean-energy industries. </p>
<p data-line-id="dc0b6f086a014c85aada90554cb7b5b1"> Solar will be essential to meet growing energy demands, not least in emerging and developing economies, where policymakers are seeking to help their citizens realize their economic aspirations while limiting greenhouse-gas emissions. For many countries, renewables like solar can also reduce reliance on energy imports, limit exposure to global supply disruptions, and improve energy security over the long term. But as technologies and consumer behavior evolve, the need for more sophisticated energy infrastructure will grow. </p>
<p data-line-id="02e80a346a774a26b5ec0a0ba7ded78c"> As matters stand, investments to expand grid infrastructure are not keeping pace with the growth of clean-energy technologies, and this is delaying the rollout of new projects, including for solar. New electricity networks often take <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/lack-of-ambition-and-attention-risks-making-electricity-grids-the-weak-link-in-clean-energy-transitions">5-15 years</a> to plan and complete, whereas new renewables projects take only 1-5 years. Making matters worse, investment in grids – which needs to reach more than <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/lack-of-ambition-and-attention-risks-making-electricity-grids-the-weak-link-in-clean-energy-transitions">$600 billion per year by 2030</a> – is not flowing to the regions that need it most. Grid investments in many emerging and developing economies have been well below the levels needed to meet robust growth in electricity demand and to expand access. </p>
<p data-line-id="ee719e5e468c4fccbc8ed59e26cf050f"> This shortfall represents an opportunity that must not be squandered. Solar PV has enormous potential to provide electricity to the many millions of people who currently lack it, most of whom are in Africa. But access to finance is crucial. Many emerging and developing economies (with the exception of China) are missing out on the current wave of clean-energy investments because of the high costs of capital for new projects. The risk premium that investors demand to enter less-established markets is directly undermining solar power’s competitiveness. </p>
<p data-line-id="c84825ec05b540fc8109d9c0e232ab04"> Removing this obstacle requires action from governments, multilateral development banks, and others to bring down the cost of capital in these markets. The situation is urgent. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, we must more than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-emerging-and-developing-economies/executive-summary">triple</a> annual clean-energy investment in emerging and developing economies within the next decade.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3b11f95bfe3144d0b6f50ce1ab174213"> Solar’s growth shows what is possible. If policymakers can overcome the remaining technological, regulatory, and financial barriers, the COP28 goal of tripling renewable-energy capacity by 2030 will be well within reach – with solar leading the way. But if these barriers remain unaddressed, the energy transition will leave many countries behind, and it will fall far short of what the world needs. </p>

A victory for Donald Trump – who has pledged to end the war in a day – would presumably give Ukraine no time to strengthen its position on the battlefield or continue draining Russian resources. In such a scenario, how might Ukraine and its partners leverage Russia’s economic weaknesses – which </em><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/russia-war-economy-weakening-under-sanctions-by-anders-aslund-2024-10"><em>you note</em></a><em> are “more severe than is commonly understood” – to bring an end to the war that does not </em><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/kamala-harris-ukraine-war-policy-correcting-biden-administration-mistakes-by-anders-aslund-2024-08"><em>involve</em></a><em> “complete capitulation to the Kremlin”?</em></p></div><p data-line-id="28b015b67caa4653b4353fe93265ede6"><strong>Anders Åslund: </strong>In the last two months, I have traveled to six European countries: Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Sweden, and Ukraine. In all of them, the frightening possibility of a Trump victory – which would be disastrous for Ukraine and Europe – loomed large.</p><p data-line-id="5769d0211704401c8abc621ae22d3520">The Nordic and Baltic countries – which, united by shared fears and interests, increasingly operate as the “Nordic-Baltic Eight” – are ramping up their defense expenditures, redoubling their commitment to NATO, and seeking to provide as much support as possible to Ukraine. The Czech, Dutch, Polish, and Romanian governments take similar positions. While they might not say so publicly, owing to diplomatic considerations, all these countries desire nothing less than regime change in Russia.</p>
