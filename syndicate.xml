<p data-line-id="60d0c2ab2f714512a7c4aecee95e3e8f"> WASHINGTON, DC – When I speak to college students about the problems with democratic socialism and populism, I often quote then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s <a href="https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/tribute-to-margaret-thatcher/">warning</a>: With these economic policies, “you eventually run out of other people’s money.” Since this often produces quizzical looks, I then follow up with a quote from Thatcher’s 1983 <a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document%2F105454">address</a> to the Conservative Party conference: “There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers’ money.” </p><p data-line-id="e8b23ed4e6bb44e9958289eed7494aa9"> I mention the Iron Lady because last month was the <a>centenary </a>of her birth, which passed with remarkably little attention. She deserves better. A champion for free people and free markets, Thatcher was a political giant on both sides of the Atlantic, leading the Tories for 15 years and serving as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990. Insofar as she is marginalized today, that is yet another reminder of how far the political right has strayed, ignoring not only her legacy but also that of her American contemporary, Ronald Reagan. </p><p data-line-id="3ebfa836303a48678563d44dc520204e"> One need only scan recent headlines to see this. Consider, for example, US President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/economy/tariff-rebate-check-proposal-what-to-know">suggestion</a> that the government should send households $2,000 tariff rebate checks to address concerns about high prices. Thatcher and Reagan would have been appalled (as they would have been by the tariffs themselves). They also would strongly oppose the Trump administration’s decisions to take equity stakes in private companies and to commandeer others’ revenue streams, as well as its attacks on immigration. Whereas Thatcher and Reagan stood up to the Soviet Union, much of today’s Republican Party is isolationist, and some on the political right are in thrall to the dictator in the Kremlin. </p><p data-line-id="4ae2d310e8dd4299901a6143f6ab219e"> But the differences go deeper than policy disagreements. Trump has long thought of the American people as victims who are helpless in the face of economic change imposed by hostile elites. In accepting the <a>2016 Republican Party’s nomination </a>for president, he <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-cleveland">proclaimed</a>: “I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.” The Republican establishment and conservative movement have lined up behind him and his <a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/forget-the-economics-of-grievance/">politics of grievance</a>. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="c982c12146b142b795427dfd8a66b4dd"> By contrast, Thatcher championed individual ability and agency. As she explained in a 1975 <a href="https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document%2F102769">speech</a>: “We must build a society in which each citizen can develop his full potential, both for his own benefit and for the community as a whole, a society in which originality, skill, energy, and thrift are rewarded, in which we encourage rather than restrict the variety and richness of human nature.” </p><p data-line-id="755397fb2d904d60ba1860270471dae0"> She also consistently conducted herself with dignity and decorum, as did Reagan, who was so diligent in upholding the dignity of his office that he insisted on <a href="https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/saving-president">walking himself into the emergency room</a> after being shot, falling to the floor only once he was inside the hospital and out of public view. </p><p data-line-id="0621fc2e2dec48f582325713fe4a7d0a"> Trump did display impressive and iconic leadership after he was shot last year. But that moment stands in stark contrast to the collapse of public dignity and the coarsening of political discourse that he has hastened. Just last month, the president of the United States <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-posts-ai-video-dumping-no-kings-protesters-rcna238521">posted</a> an AI-generated video of a fighter jet dumping feces on Americans who oppose him. And again, where Trump leads, Republicans follow. Vice President JD Vance, for example, recently <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1970897642361135146">responded</a> to a critic on X by calling him a “dipshit.” </p><p data-line-id="aac3d716024e40559c8a27da39d8b229"> Dignity, decorum, and seriousness matter in a democracy. Elected leaders who renounce them lose the confidence of those who are not already in their camp. It becomes more difficult for the country to come together to face adversity – be it a pandemic, a terrorist attack, an economic calamity, or a war – as leaders struggle to compromise to address policy challenges. </p><p data-line-id="956650675129447790ee50d96aa1f420"> Under Trump’s watch, his MAGA (“Make America Great Again”) movement has served as a conduit for some of the ugliest forces in politics to make a run at the mainstream. Tucker Carlson’s recent interview of the <a href="https://x.com/SocDoneLeft/status/1618056072690008069">Holocaust-denying</a>, <a href="https://x.com/seanfeucht/status/1983208681551335936">Hitler-admiring</a>, white-nationalist, anti-liberal MAGA influencer Nick Fuentes was a case in point. Carlson has often used an aggressive interview style with opponents, but this time, he did not challenge his subject’s appalling and dangerous views. Nor was this the first time that Carlson had <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/09/tucker-carlsons-dark-turn/">promoted</a> anti-Semitism. </p><p data-line-id="168ad51adcda499392d7468f96504a45"> Carlson is no marginal figure. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/arts/television/trump-rnc-milwaukee.html">sat</a> with the Trump family at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where the party nominated Trump for president for the third time. After the conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated, Vance hosted Kirk’s podcast and had Carlson on as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQGPDjALd4">guest</a>. Will the American right continue to stand by Carlson? The Heritage Foundation has. Will Vance? </p><p data-line-id="2109d71c5e5049699aa6ac25418469fb"> While Trump has proven to be a strong ally of Israel, he won’t be around forever. Will the Carlsons of the right gain greater influence when he leaves the stage? </p><p data-line-id="2cad3162eb1a47b8be1ad7e2529fa944"> Thatcher and Reagan believed in the inherent dignity of each and every human being. A political movement that shares that belief cannot give any quarter to racists or anti-Semites. To embrace the latter is to renounce the former. </p><p data-line-id="885bb97bf6ed4310b84b1c971046cb17"> In her 1975 speech, Thatcher welcomed the fact that “a new debate is beginning – or perhaps I should say an old debate is being renewed – about the proper role of government” and the “attitudes” on which government rests. The silver lining in the dark cloud stalking the Republican Party is that a similar debate is on the horizon, as the fight over the right’s post-Trump future begins. Those of us who cherish the legacy of Thatcher and Reagan have much at stake, as do all Americans – and the world at large. </p>

<p data-line-id="e830beb8e8f4449cb6acdb0a45963124"> PARIS – Around the world, energy systems are undergoing profound, rapid transformations that will leave them looking dramatically different a decade from now. A major driver is the increasing electrification of the global economy. Not only are more people adopting electric vehicles, heat pumps, and smart (digitally interconnected) appliances; we are also witnessing explosive growth in the construction of electricity-hungry data centers, many of them powering AI. Owing to these trends, the International Energy Agency has <a href="https://x.com/fbirol/status/1846400954536460734?s=20">projected</a> that electricity demand will grow six times faster than overall energy demand by 2035. </p><p data-line-id="9caa1bfdf72e4d50b01251cbc2caaea1"> The supply side of the energy sector is also evolving rapidly. Renewable energy sources, especially solar, are <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">set to play</a> increasingly significant roles in power systems globally. These trends and technologies could deliver greater energy independence and lower emissions if the right policies and infrastructure are in place. But they also add a layer of complexity to grid management, because operators must account for variable flows of electricity while ensuring reliability and affordability for consumers. </p><p data-line-id="1fb8d1b3e3604c9d83721121400e409a"> Grids also need to power more places and things. By 2030, homes and businesses will have <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai">more than 30 billion</a> digitally connected devices, twice as many as today. To keep pace, energy systems’ flexibility – their ability to respond in a timely manner to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand – must increase much faster than is currently expected.  </p><p data-line-id="71ba988fefe74af9aa0c9018e117957f"> Digitalization could be the key to closing the gap, even as it introduces new hurdles. Digital tools for optimizing power systems can improve efficiency, enhance affordability, and strengthen energy security. And AI, especially, has huge potential to strengthen and streamline electricity systems. As recent <a href="https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/energy-and-ai-observatory?tab=AI+for+energy">case studies</a> make clear, models and tools that are already available can better predict the output of weather-sensitive sources of generation, assist with aligning supply and demand throughout the day, and help detect and correct infrastructure anomalies as they arise. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="2772632c15d542ac99e900dd55764c5d"> But to make the most of these opportunities, certain challenges need to be managed. Even when the lion’s share of new demand- and supply-side technologies are digitally enabled – implying the potential to be connected to other digital systems – they tend to operate in isolation. Often, they feature proprietary designs, lack standardized interfaces, and do not have the necessary functionality to interact dynamically with the grid. Such fragmentation creates unnecessary inefficiencies, raises costs, stifles innovation, and makes it harder to realize the benefits of digitalization on a broader scale. </p><p data-line-id="3e613cb633ff4ebb85e77ff027a4431e"> That is why it is not enough for our energy systems merely to be furnished with digital capabilities. They also must become interoperable so that new technologies can be introduced and integrated seamlessly. When every node on the network can communicate effectively, those managing the system can achieve desired outcomes faster.  </p><p data-line-id="51b9ffb6576e49faabf5f78f895d3508"> If well implemented, greater interoperability between digital technologies on both the demand and supply sides of the energy sector can deliver real dividends. Smart EV chargers could shift charging to times when renewable generation is high. Modern thermostats and appliances could respond to price signals in real time, helping to reduce peak electricity consumption. Rooftop solar systems could be aggregated to provide power to grids when needed. With the right frameworks, these resources can work together, driving progress toward the energy goals that countries and communities have set.  </p><p data-line-id="9c35f0e1438a4d3591f8589e5639f36a"> Unless we do more to ensure interoperability, we risk a future of squandered potential, missed opportunities, stranded investments, and rising energy-security threats. Cyberattacks on energy utilities have already more than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai">tripled</a> in frequency over the past four years, and now AI is making the attacks more sophisticated. Yet we know that interoperable systems built on common standards can be more resilient to such threats.  </p><p data-line-id="cb64bb4138c0418795c8b46096bed9a2"> That is why we are calling for governments and industry to collaborate and work toward strong, secure digitalized energy systems. More than ever, we need a shared vision and long-term planning. Recent proposals for a <a href="https://energy.becknprotocol.io/">Digital Energy Grid</a> aim to create a unified digital backbone for the energy ecosystem by introducing universal identity, machine readability, and verifiability. Since these features would enable transparent, reliable, and interoperable energy transactions, they should be taken up in earnest. </p><p data-line-id="dc48ce8d35284690ad82dbd1e73bc23c"> Building on these ideas, India is already taking a calibrated step forward with the launch of the India Energy Stack. The IES aims to build a digital public infrastructure that <a href="https://fsrglobal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IES-Concept-Brief.pdf">enables</a> identification and value exchange across a multitude of actors and assets through uniform specifications and standards. </p><p data-line-id="5ca36fec85814468aface64bf400419e"> Energy systems will continue to be transformed one way or another. We must act now to ensure that the systems that emerge reflect thoughtful design choices. That means fostering global cooperation and creating shared forms of infrastructure that will work for everyone. </p>

<p data-line-id="24a28a6b8d1f4391a0dd11b3c468e62b"> BELÉM – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, has been eagerly awaited worldwide. A COP in the Amazon raises expectations for all those who recognize the urgency of climate change and its impact on our lives and environment. That is why Brazilian President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> is calling this the “COP of Truth.” </p>
<p data-line-id="eadaf355bb6c43378c71f937a6a7cf2c"> As co-hosts for this COP, the Indigenous peoples and local communities of Brazil’s Amazon region understand what is at stake. We are among those who suffer the most from climate change, since our lives and livelihoods are directly connected to the natural ecosystems and biodiversity that global warming threatens. We are also among those who can provide some of the most powerful responses to the problem. For example, territories managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities have deforestation rates up to 50% lower than other <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2021/03/State-of-Worlds-Indigenous-Peoples-Vol-V-Final.pdf">areas</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="cffbf45b510b4ceb92ab4992c0645694"> This is no accident. We are spiritually connected to nature; by relying on traditional knowledge to safeguard our territories, we also protect crucial carbon sinks and ecosystem services that benefit everyone.  </p>
<p data-line-id="426218a180b44600a8df03173721d411"> To meet the urgent goals enshrined in the Paris climate agreement, everyone must recognize the contributions of Indigenous peoples in formulating climate policies. That means recognizing territorial protection and land-tenure policies as inherently effective climate measures.  </p>
<p data-line-id="f89247fee10941029a0a8e8fe45dc2da"> Such recognition also highlights another issue. Historically, Indigenous peoples have received the fewest resources in the flow of climate and environmental finance: <a href="https://www.speciesconservation.org/blog/mbzf-backed-global-study-on-indigenous-peoples-climate-contributions-reaches-a-key-milestone/">less than 1%</a> of all funding actually reaches these territories, which is both inefficient and unjust. That is why the Brazilian government, working closely with other countries and Indigenous organizations, has gone to great lengths to ensure that COP30 benefits those who protect forests. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="1e8f6cceeafb4d70b89cf560e8f06f02"> Among the measures needed to make this a reality is the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, announced at the COP30 World Leaders Summit on November 6. The goal is to recognize and secure a predefined amount of land or territories managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities by 2030. Such a historic agreement is not only ambitious; it is also the first global commitment on land tenure. Brazil has worked with the Forest and Climate Leaders’ Partnership, a coalition of 36 governments and the European Union, to advance this vital commitment, setting the stage for COP30 to become a defining moment in the global climate agenda. </p>
<p data-line-id="1fd17c989a6a41528b523657ae7b3489"> Moreover, donor governments and philanthropic institutions will renew a 2021 <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2025/10/cop26-forest-pledge-to-support-indigenous-local-rights-was-just-met-what-was-learned/">commitment</a> (initially made at COP26 in Glasgow) to allocate another $1.7 billion over the next five years to programs that strengthen land tenure and forests. The original commitment exceeded the initial target, and <a href="https://carbon-pulse.com/436950/">$1.86 billion</a> has already been mobilized. By renewing it, governments and civil society are signaling that they remain as committed as ever to this critical dimension of climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="c3ef01ffd5da4659b75b7e71f11310c5"> After being announced by heads of state and government, these commitments will be formally signed on November 17 at an event showcasing the COP30 Action Agenda, a central theme of which is to achieve a “<a href="https://cop30.br/en/brazilian-presidency/cop-30-circles/global-ethical-stocktake">global ethical balance</a>.” For example, only around 10% of that $1.86 billion is estimated to have been transferred directly to Indigenous peoples and local communities. With the “Pledge 2.0,” and as part of the COP30 Action Agenda, we aim to increase this percentage substantially. Those who manage their territories more effectively deserve to manage a greater share of the resources allocated for territorial protection. </p>
<p data-line-id="dc4d63b3728b4c05bd96312aac863487"> Following the announcement at the World Leaders Summit, the land tenure and financial commitments will be officially launched at an event in the Blue Zone that I will lead on November 17. I will be joined by ministers and officials from other tropical countries, donors, philanthropic institutions, and, of course, Indigenous leaders. </p>
<p data-line-id="7bf8e29713474310892d1780b07b2540"> Moreover, these commitments will serve as the foundation for another major initiative at this COP: the launch of the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. Since Indigenous peoples and local communities are essential to guaranteeing the successful implementation of this facility, they will manage at least 20% of the funds it mobilizes.  </p>
<p data-line-id="b25c3aa3b5b14ef08e698bef40d735b2"> These are major breakthroughs, and it is important to remember that they were made possible only because Indigenous peoples and local communities have demanded a voice in decision-making processes. Participation is crucial to recognition. That is why we have a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil, and it is why COP30 will elevate our unique voices and insights. Through my ministry, Indigenous organizations, and other partners, we are making possible the COP Village, an accommodation for three thousand Indigenous people who will be the heart of this COP.  </p>
<p data-line-id="1bf0ff3791e04de1a3b68b93c1b3dae9"> We will also have the largest number of Indigenous people in the world accredited in the Blue Zone, thanks to the COP30 presidency’s creation of a People’s Circle. By offering better forms of participation and advocacy, Brazil has created the conditions for Indigenous peoples and local communities to be heard like never before. </p>
<p data-line-id="7d3af3ae9bbf40b2905de78435fc8848"> Brazil invites all governments, donors, and development institutions to join the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment and to contribute to the renewed Land and Forest Pledge. Only by working together can we protect the world’s ecosystems, strengthen land tenure and the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities, and invest in people as the foundation for resilient development, a just transition, and lasting climate stability. </p>

proposes building blocks for a coordinated strategy to deliver sustained “blue” investment.        </p>
</header>
</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="d003c030d9b64e53b7eb2e55a3d31d51"> MONACO – Two major events this summer – the Blue Economy and Finance Forum (BEFF) in Monaco, and the third United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice – reflected the growing recognition that protecting the ocean is not only an environmental issue, but also a political, economic, financial, and social imperative. The challenge now is to translate this rapidly emerging consensus into concrete, sustained action. </p>
<p data-line-id="f33d82cca0914bc8a44aec0e18cb83d3"> Covering over two-thirds of our planet and accounting for 97% of its biosphere, the ocean is a critical ally in our efforts to tackle climate change, ensure food security, and support livelihoods. Without a healthy ocean, sustainable development will remain a distant dream. But protecting and restoring marine ecosystems costs money, and financial flows are falling far short of need. To close this gap, ocean protection must be regarded not as charity, but as an opportunity – a high-value investment in our collective future. </p>
<p data-line-id="4c2b4bc615c940e99fcbb31180300760"> The vision of a thriving ocean economy that offers both short-term profit and long-term value in terms of food security, employment, and resilience galvanized the political leaders, entrepreneurs, investors, philanthropists, and representatives of multilateral organizations and civil society at the BEFF. The event delivered on its goal of unlocking funding for ocean-positive projects, including through innovative instruments like blue bonds and blended-finance vehicles, which combine public, private, and philanthropic resources. It thus represented an important first step toward anchoring ocean protection where it counts: within the financial industry. </p>
<p data-line-id="b464fa7a0037435d9947718dde8c810d"> But the new “blue” investment announced by public, private, and philanthropic actors at the BEFF – amounting to some <a href="https://beff2025monaco.org/images/ANBilanBlue%20Economy%20and%20Finance%20ForumVDEF_11.06.pdf">€8.7 billion ($10.1 billion)</a> – represents only a fraction of what is needed to meet global targets. Moreover, isolated commitments, however ambitious, do not necessarily lead to <a>the sustained</a>, coordinated investment that scaling the blue economy demands. A more strategic approach, which focuses on leveraging public and philanthropic capital to de-risk investment in ocean-positive projects and attract long-term private finance, is urgently needed.  </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="bd39ba97d2114d03bbbdac8fd103568e"> Three imperatives stand out. The first is to create a robust pipeline of investable projects. As it stands, many promising initiatives remain stuck at the pilot stage. A lack of early-stage financing, technical assistance, or enabling policies means that they never get to a point where they are appealing to private investors. </p>
<p data-line-id="e7d9975eaa8f43f386a2c1bb81401b08"> Monaco is doing its part to bridge this gap. The ReOcean Fund – an ocean-focused private equity fund, co-managed by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation (of which I am president) and Monaco Asset Management – has <a href="https://www.fpa2.org/en/news/successful-raise-of-73-million-dollars-for-the-reocean-fund-08499">raised</a> $73 million to invest in companies pioneering technologies that promise to advance critical goals like restoring marine ecosystems and decarbonizing shipping. But the responsibility for sustaining a pipeline of bankable projects ultimately falls to governments and development banks, which must use public finance to redefine investment risk so that it reflects the real economic returns of protecting marine ecosystems. </p>
<p data-line-id="1de5d44a4869400d8c5148f50685caad"> The second imperative is to create enabling conditions for investment. If ocean-relevant sectors – such as shipping, fisheries, coastal infrastructure, and tourism – are to align their activities with the blue-economy vision, they must be guided (and constrained) by net-zero and nature-positive targets that are ambitious and credible. Governments must not only develop and enforce the right rules of the game, including regional marine spatial plans, but also lead by example. That means eliminating poorly designed and harmful government subsidies, such as those driving exploitation of overfished stocks, and using those public resources to finance ocean-positive projects and cover transition costs for ocean-dependent sectors. With WTO Agreement Fish 1 now in force, the world has taken a historic first step toward curbing illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing and protecting vulnerable stocks, while negotiations continue over Fish 2, which will tackle overfishing capacities. </p>
<p data-line-id="10a4515255794ddf8a3ca99688f0e83e"> Public development banks must also do their part to strengthen investor confidence and catalyze market-wide change. At the BEFF, more than 20 public development banks endorsed the Finance in Common Ocean Coalition <a href="https://financeincommon.org/the-fics-ocean-coalition-releases-a-joint-statement-at-the-blue-economy-and-finance-forum-in-monaco">joint statement</a>, which articulated a collective ambition to scale up ocean finance, align portfolios with a regenerative and sustainable blue economy, and support pipeline development by sharing tools and methodologies. These institutions must follow through on these commitments, and their peers must join them. </p>
<p data-line-id="bb7571346fc24f8f83db95f86c060f54"> Finally, financial flows throughout the economy must be aligned with climate, biodiversity, and equity goals. For governments, this means integrating environmental and social externalities into public budgets, with national accounting systems factoring in both the value of ecosystem services and the financial risks arising from environmental degradation. </p>
<p data-line-id="ba9c916fad064506b1893269148bc39c"> Financial actors – including institutional investors, corporations, asset managers, and insurers – also have a critical role to play, not only as funders, but also by stepping up as core architects of a regenerative and sustainable blue economy. To this end, they must create clear taxonomies and metrics, which support consistent decision-making and prevent greenwashing. Blended-finance mechanisms and biodiversity credits and certificates can help provide the right incentives, aligning private finance with measurable sustainability outcomes. </p>
<p data-line-id="768d2f70837042889aa9de1bba80fc3d"> The ocean economy is beginning to take shape. The BEFF laid important foundations, and promising instruments – such as venture capital funds targeting ocean innovation, guarantee facilities supporting small and medium-sized enterprises dedicated to delivering ocean-positive outcomes, and sovereign blue bonds – are gaining traction. But the momentum from the summer must not be squandered. It must be translated into a clear and coordinated strategy for the decade. </p>

<p data-line-id="c90a5bc5c2334abfb1cd75ab0f0b3478"> WASHINGTON, DC – This year marks a historic milestone: for the first time, global renewable-energy production has surpassed coal. In the first half of 2025, renewables accounted for <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/global-electricity-mid-year-insights-2025/global-analysis/">more than 34%</a> of the world’s electricity, while coal’s share fell to just above 33%. Notably, these gains were largely driven by emerging economies. </p><p data-line-id="b683da6a2990429a8fb63a49d6f12e18"> As the world’s attention turns to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30), this milestone serves as a powerful reminder that the clean-energy transition is already underway. Having led investments at the US International Development Finance Corporation and now serving as chief investment officer at the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, I know a promising business opportunity when I see one.  </p><p data-line-id="2b2fd1f87363409aa6f9c5c2f6bf8bf4"> According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), <a href="https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2025/Jul/91-Percent-of-New-Renewable-Projects-Now-Cheaper-Than-Fossil-Fuels-Alternatives">91% of new renewable-energy projects</a> are now cheaper than their fossil-fuel counterparts. This finding provides clear evidence that, despite the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/22/global-use-of-coal-hit-record-high-in-2024">ongoing growth</a> in coal and oil use, renewables are both economically and technically viable throughout much of the world. </p><p data-line-id="e076b008dff7475bb5aafa597e398444"> We cannot afford to let today’s momentum slip away. </p><p data-line-id="77be2c69b72b464483331d01d56f58ed"> To reduce climate pollution, promote sustainable economic growth, and strengthen energy resilience where it is needed most, we must build on these achievements. As we approach the tenth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, meaningful global climate action is still possible, even in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions and competing national priorities. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="590dc0d4fbc24a05a5c3425c32f397f2"> Yet such progress is inherently fragile. All too often, clean-energy adoption stalls once the infrastructure is in place. Solar projects, for example, can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/climate/africa-world-bank-solar-electricity.html">fail</a> when communities lack the necessary tools and financing to make full use of the electricity they produce.  </p><p data-line-id="dab5f5f65cb744239dea984a7ab7bcc7"> Providing solar panels is not enough. To lock in the benefits of renewables, governments must invest not only in power generation but also in systems, training, and equipment – such as electric mills and water pumps – that enable communities and countries to harness clean energy for business growth and job creation. </p><p data-line-id="67ecf75476db48668f04b1999473b840"> When implemented effectively, such investments deliver benefits across the board. Climate goals advance as renewables replace costly, polluting fuels. Communities gain access to affordable power, enabling them to improve education and health care, create jobs, and raise incomes. And with energy companies profiting from rising demand, emerging economies can <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/why-our-clean-energy-future-depends-emerging-economies--ecmii-2025-09-18/">attract new investment</a>.  </p><p data-line-id="edc7abef78534a79ab2425e938cbd7b6"> The challenge is enormous, but so is the opportunity. The World Bank projects that <a href="https://www.devcommittee.org/content/dam/sites/devcommittee/doc/documents/2025/Final_DC2025-0002.pdf">1.2 billion young people</a> in developing economies will reach working age over the next decade, but that only 420 million new jobs will be created by then. Access to clean energy, and the opportunities it brings, offers a way to bridge this gap before it becomes a global crisis. The World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/07/investment-emerging-economies-energy-transition">estimates</a> that the renewables industry alone could generate <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/in-full/2-drivers-of-labour-market-transformation/">more than 30 million jobs</a> and mobilize $2.2-2.8 trillion annually. Embedding renewable technologies into other downstream sectors such as industry and agriculture could create <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Transforming-a-Billion-Lives-The-Job-Creation-Potential-from-a-Green-Power-Transition-in-the-Energy-Poor-World.pdf">a further 500 million new jobs</a> and improve the quality of 700 million existing ones. </p><p data-line-id="b3d1c1e16ae9431d809b268d431e0277"> To succeed, we must align energy policies with broader development objectives, integrate renewables into local industries, and accelerate investment in the equipment and training needed to use it effectively.  </p><p data-line-id="a98d519e906b4c1e9fec6980e86971d9"> Across Africa, this approach is already delivering tangible results. In Nigeria, farmers and traders are increasingly using solar-powered irrigation pumps, cold-storage facilities, and mills. These investments, in turn, have fueled a <a href="https://issuu.com/geapp/docs/global_energy_alliance_2025_impact_report/90">wave of distributed renewable-energy projects</a> that are rapidly transforming local power systems.  </p><p data-line-id="12d0e0b09f134a1e9d485bfe11a8f3b3"> In the Amazon, where COP30 is underway, the government of Brazil is investing $800 million to expand energy access and transition away from reliance on diesel. My organization is <a href="https://energyalliance.org/brazil/">helping</a> to ensure that this new renewable energy creates jobs and powers sustainable economic development for thousands of farmers and entrepreneurs.  </p><p data-line-id="9d446d1c88e441b5916de1116299a0aa"> India offers a useful model for emerging economies seeking to strengthen their power grids and absorb growing renewable capacity. In New Delhi, the country’s first <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/this-battery-storage-fix-offers-a-blueprint-for-systems-level-solutions-110853">commercial, utility-scale battery-energy storage system</a> – the largest in South Asia – now guarantees a reliable supply of clean electricity to 100,000 low-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, solar plants in Rajasthan provide steady daytime power to 40,000 farmers. And in Uttar Pradesh, a women’s entrepreneurship program aims to help 500,000 women-owned businesses adopt clean-energy technologies by 2030. </p><p data-line-id="49a0740bed5649d68d265a6cde18f0fb"> Together, these examples show that the clean-energy transition is within reach. But with <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/12-06-2024-progress-on-basic-energy-access-reverses-for-first-time-in-a-decade">685 million people</a> worldwide lacking electricity, and more than a billion relying on unaffordable or unreliable supply, there is still a long way to go.  </p><p data-line-id="07d66246906c493591e5797a175eb737"> The choice before us is clear: continue investing in renewables or slide back into fossil-fuel dependence. By making clean energy the foundation for job creation and economic opportunity, we can turn today’s milestones into a future where clean power drives growth and ensures prosperity for all. </p>

<p data-line-id="803af9d4ef1d492dbe147e74c7a22f01"> NEW YORK – Try putting yourself in <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>’s shoes. You could spend your days on what made you one of the world’s richest people while also deploying your wealth to do the most good. You could invest in for-profit ventures pursuing things like clean-energy breakthroughs, or in effecting changes in policy. And to mark your 70th birthday, you could publish an essay that would quickly become a global news story. </p><p data-line-id="8596414728b2426ebefbbac21e4c6cd5"> Gates has done it all. His essay, “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">Three Tough Truths About Climate</a>,” sent a shockwave through the climate movement on the eve of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil. But the essay is less blueprint than Rorschach test, because anyone can selectively quote from its 5,000 words to support a wide variety of viewpoints. </p><p data-line-id="037f7cd06aee4fbc9a3a071ae25f25fd"> Like many such documents, this one begins with a strawman. In a move more typical of the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based group founded on the premise that environmentalism harms the climate cause, Gates rejects the “doomsday” argument that “nothing matters more than limiting the rise in temperature.” Little does – but Gates chose to go with “nothing,” a much stronger word. </p><p data-line-id="9c4b22c37a5f4c189966267642b4665c"> He then argues that climate change, though a “serious” problem, “will not be the end of civilization.” But supercharged storms and other climate-driven disasters are already upending lives and livelihoods. Of the five recorded storms severe enough to warrant the proposed “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-hurricane-melissa-show-its-time-for-a-category-6-designation/">category 6</a>” classification, all have happened in the past 15 years. </p><p data-line-id="87fd6f8c7d8d48cb91d52d0368dd9521"> Moreover, we are not dealing only with massive, headline-grabbing extremes and <a href="http://www.gwagner.com/tipping-economics">global tipping points</a> (irreversible planetary changes). There are also the pernicious, often hidden “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691221038/slow-burn">slow burn</a>” effects, like the <a href="https://gwagner.com/hle">0.04% loss</a> in annual payroll for one additional day above 32°C (90°F) in any given year. Such costs add up quickly. To point out that we can still live with average global warming <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/investment-decarbonization-trillions-climate-costs">below 3°C</a> is hardly reassuring, especially for the poor and vulnerable who already suffer the most. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="afea525eb5294f3d822b61f71c73fcf4"> Gates’s reasoning on this socioeconomic dimension is understandable. His second and third tough truths focus on human suffering and prosperity, and these are indeed the criteria against which climate progress should be measured. Annual greenhouse-gas emissions, their atmospheric concentrations, the resulting warming, and effects like rising seas and more devastating storms are all ultimately proxies for lives that will be disrupted or even ended prematurely. </p><p data-line-id="a292d52f9fba402a8a6d3747c8200cb8"> Climate change kills. Economists can now calculate the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24487-w">mortality cost of carbon</a>. Each ton of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted today kills around 0.0002 people. Again, such costs can add up quickly. The lifetime emissions generated by every 3.5 Americans today will kill one person by the end of the century. </p><p data-line-id="5a84976b6fcd4877979596f787721a6e"> True, many people already die from other preventable causes. Gates himself has called out US President Donald Trump’s administration for cutting aid funding in ways that will <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">kill children</a> in some of the poorest parts of the world. In an effort to make up for some of the shortfall with his own foundation and personal wealth, Gates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/climate/bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-cuts.html">has reduced his giving</a> for climate programs and investments, both in the US and globally. </p><p data-line-id="19bd406446e94130b513ae094ed5cf3d"> No one doubts that there are only so many philanthropic dollars to go around. But climate finance goes well beyond charity, as Gates shows by his own actions. His own total <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/04/climate-bill-gates-memo">public health and climate funding have increased</a> over time. “Funding,” in this case, includes support for Breakthrough Energy (which has no relation to the Institute), which has invested in more than 150 companies that need help scaling up climate technologies by driving down the “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/introducing-the-green-premiums">green premium</a>” (the added costs of low-carbon technologies relative to high-carbon ones that pay nothing for their negative externalities). </p><p data-line-id="81f276dfe091491d8bb1569f5d093b2f"> Reducing this premium is necessary for many early-stage startups that have yet to climb the learning curve and benefit from economies of scale. Fortunately, there are plenty of other climate technologies that are already in the money. Solar power’s rapid growth over the past half-decade is the result of economics, not benevolence. The same goes for battery prices, which have <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/energy-storage">fallen by about 50%</a> since 2010. </p><p data-line-id="169ccd29f02242df87ebcd09e120ccb2"> While other low-carbon technologies still command a green premium, most are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/what-would-it-take-to-scale-critical-climate-technologies">trending toward profitability</a>. Still, we need creative thinking to help them get there. Co-production helps. A company focused on a single product might lose against incumbents, but spreading the green premium across two or more products can cut costs significantly. The Gates-funded company Brimstone, for example, focuses both on <a href="https://gwagner.com/ft-cement">producing lower-carbon cement</a> and on making money from the alumina extracted in the production process. <a href="http://gwagner.com/years-sublime">Sublime</a>, a rival cement startup, is pursuing a similar strategy. (I recently co-authored a <a href="https://gwagner.com/coproduction">study</a> with Brimstone’s CEO, Cody Finke, and a half-dozen colleagues, including an employee of another Gates-funded venture, on precisely this point.) </p><p data-line-id="2c7d9abc8948446092ad6d7a01f708b9"> Patience helps, too. Back when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was the governor of the Bank of England, he poignantly described the climate as a “<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability">tragedy of the horizon</a>.” Too many businesses feel compelled to focus on short-term earnings, just as political leaders are unable to think beyond election cycles. But some of Gates’s climate investments, like those in the <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/work/accelerate-energy-innovation/reader/the-future-of-energy-is-subatomic">next-generation nuclear</a> company TerraPower, and especially his investments in Commonwealth Fusion, are deliberately structured to yield returns years or even decades from now. </p><p data-line-id="77f97b353b024e5dafc93fc082fda226"> Supportive policies help, such as the explicit carbon prices and <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/2040-climate-target_en">decarbonization targets</a> in the European Union, or the <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/insights/climate/one-big-beautiful-bill-setback-clean-energy">subsidies</a> that are more prominent in the United States. The key, in each case, is to provide long-term investment certainty. This is an area where Gates’s essay is especially weak. While Gates fully recognizes the importance of policy, he has created an opening for those, like Trump, who put their personal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/why-the-us-economy-might-benefit-from-abandoning-clean-energy-goals">short-term gain</a> first. </p><p data-line-id="fac84665a9fe48e18baf04b99c503c9b"> But make no mistake: the benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels far outweigh the costs. Gates clearly understands that. Clean energy is about <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165460">sovereignty, energy security, equity</a>, and, yes, future competitiveness. Ending reliance on oil, coal, and gas, and embracing technologies that will only become better and cheaper over time, is not just smart climate policy. It is the best way to improve economic competitiveness and human prosperity for decades to come. </p>

<p data-line-id="6822b0a9d9f645a1a67f6840fac66a1e"> LONDON – The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), now underway in Brazil, marks a decade since 195 parties adopted the landmark Paris climate agreement at COP21. But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/from-billions-to-trillions-setting-a-new-goal-on-climate-finance">trillions of dollars</a>, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing. </p><p data-line-id="eb5c4554993c48f687f8eec2e6367639"> The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks. </p><p data-line-id="34a307d24aa944879780748e1f49e5c4"> The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/promising-new-technologies-face-market-uncertainty-in-pivotal-moment-for-global-energy-innovation">warned</a> that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-state-of-energy-innovation/executive-summary">declined</a> across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="347f63bffcf34424a30931fef7c2d97b"> While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities. </p><p data-line-id="aab6bbd009b443d1b086186935f021bc"> From its very inception, the <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/">Council for Inclusive Capitalism</a> (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">call</a> to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/just-energy-transition-home/">just climate transition</a>. </p><p data-line-id="0d90eabba43c4ff3871d27960c3b7c93"> Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices. </p><p data-line-id="224c98979fbe4b58a23fb16b5d1ddef0"> Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/unga-80-climate-week-2025/">meeting</a> with World Bank President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-banga">Ajay Banga</a> at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind. </p><p data-line-id="4da1854df1b545a69996894d3be336b1"> Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/investing-in-climate-for-growth-and-development_16b7cbc7-en.html">joint report</a> by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="ca81660fb7824eef8ccf5fa2e463447b"> Other emerging markets are also <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">making strides</a>. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s <a href="https://etedge-insights.com/industry/energy/india-takes-giant-leap-to-become-worlds-second-largest-renewable-energy-market-by-2030-iea-report/">second-largest renewable-energy market</a> after China. For developing countries, <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/news-insights/2025-steering-committee-meeting/">inclusive growth</a> is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="93976b0f0a5b4a96b0bd7bd9aef4936c"> Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s industrial and climate policies were already <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c">experiencing delays</a> even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32r5k43vwo">jeopardizing</a> the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms. </p><p data-line-id="5dcac16330fb42a392b930c20a72a6cc"> Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs. </p><p data-line-id="9ffd97bb64624c649d91c194eee16faf"> The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet. </p>

<p data-line-id="5fe51840c7a445e7a6d112dbcc1340c8"> WASHINGTON, DC – The international community is quick to highlight Africa’s development challenges and failures, often citing the continent’s limited progress on poverty reduction and climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="945fc1e49d43480080419484efce9fca"> Consider the persistent focus on Africa’s massive climate-finance gap, estimated at around <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/climate-finance-needs-of-african-countries/">$2.8 trillion</a> between 2020 and 2030, and its unsustainable debt burden, with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) now <a href="https://drgr.org/news/paying-for-the-past-or-investing-in-the-future-africas-debt-and-climate-dilemma/">spending more</a> on debt service than it receives in climate finance. Much attention has also been devoted to African countries’ disappointing progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The continent is on track to achieve <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-makes-recommendations-to-accelerate-sdgs-in-africa-agenda-2063/">only 6%</a> of the 32 measurable SDG targets by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f5adafbf89b4547b1b0bab5b82a7b2e"> But these challenges are compounded by the lack of international development support. Nowhere is the gap between rhetoric and action more evident than in efforts to achieve <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">SDG 15</a>, which aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including by combating deforestation. From 2010 to 2020, Africa had the world’s <a href="https://www.fao.org/interactive/forest-resources-assessment/2020/en/">largest annual rate of net forest loss</a>, averaging 3.9 million hectares. Given the scale of the problem, the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém must adopt a more proactive and comprehensive strategy to prevent deforestation and curb related environmental risks. </p>
<p data-line-id="3beece83c58f45a1b1fe1b3765389077"> A wide array of proven interventions – many seen as beyond the realm of climate policy – could protect millions of hectares of forest in Africa each year, especially in the Congo Basin, one of the most essential global commons. Home to the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/10/20/congo-basin-forests-hold-trillions-in-untapped-value-new-report-calls-for-strategic-global-investment">second-largest tropical rainforest</a>, the Congo Basin absorbs nearly <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/critical-ecosystems-congo-basin-peatlands">1.5 billion tons</a> of carbon dioxide annually and is a biodiversity hotspot, with roughly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/congo-basin/">10,000 species of tropical plants</a>, 30% of which are unique to the region. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="53102ab4d2a0497bb2b4f76e04b24bde"> Preserving the Congo Basin is especially important because the insatiable global demand for Africa’s natural resources has decimated the continent’s forests. This process began in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as European imperial powers exported timber and cleared vast swaths of old-growth forest for cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, palm oil, tea, and rubber. It has continued and even intensified in recent years, driven by demographic pressures and rising Asian demand for raw materials. As a result, tropical Africa has lost <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/05/deforestation-africa">around 22%</a> of its forested area since 1900 – comparable to the more widely publicized losses in the Amazon. </p>
<p data-line-id="70dfd877e3e34059acd921e9cbdb6258"> Deforestation is fast approaching a tipping point in the Congo Basin. Between 2002 and 2024, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which contains <a href="https://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/our-projects/where-we-work/drc/">about 60%</a> of the Congo Basin rainforest, lost <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/COD/">7.4 million hectares</a> of humid primary forest, which accounted for 36% of its total tree cover loss. If current deforestation rates persist, large portions of the Congo Basin <a href="https://www.forestsnews.org/79903/over-a-quarter-of-congo-basin-forests-at-risk-of-vanishing-by-2050">could disappear</a> by 2050, with dire consequences for global climate stability. </p>
<p data-line-id="ea15ae50fd644a079ab8039fac5a14b6"> Importantly, the world’s insatiable appetite for Africa’s natural resources is not the only driver of deforestation. Subsistence farming and increased housing demand, especially in rapidly growing urban areas, have also led to large-scale land-clearing, owing mainly to low agricultural productivity and poor territorial planning. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc65c66b1034cf3a7f343d1ac9fe480"> In many African countries, crop yields reach <a href="https://news.unl.edu/article/yield-gap-study-highlights-potential-for-higher-crop-yields-in-africa">only 20-30%</a> of their potential because of the lack of irrigation (currently less than 5% of cultivated land in SSA is irrigated), sparse use of fertilizers and high-quality seed varieties, and <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/feeding-africa-how-small-scale-irrigation-can-help-farmers-change-game/">inadequate access to technology</a>. To meet the nutrition needs of a fast-growing population that is expected to reach <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/09/PT-african-century">2.5 billion</a> by 2050, farmers often compensate for low crop yields by clearing more land and resorting to reduced fallow periods. </p>
<p data-line-id="c10f725c89cb47f8945726440ecddab2"> Unplanned urbanization is equally harmful. Poor housing standards and the proliferation of low-quality single-family homes that lack basic amenities have triggered urban sprawl. Many African cities – from Lagos and Douala to Kinshasa and Kibera – are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837722000060">growing out, not up</a>, with millions of hectares of forest cleared to make room for such dwellings. Compounding these pressures is the fact that <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/72270">more than 70%</a> of households in SSA still use wood for cooking and heating, leading to even more environmental degradation. This amplifies the negative long-term effects that poor urban planning has on the climate. </p>
<p data-line-id="ac5278e45c364b1faba5d502ffaffd8d"> Although world leaders declared their commitment to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation at <a href="https://www.ciwem.org/news/cop26-100-world-leaders-commit-to-halt-and-reverse-forest-loss-by-2030">previous COPs</a>, deforestation in Africa continues to outpace restoration efforts, including those by the <a href="https://www.wri.org/initiatives/african-forest-landscape-restoration-initiative-afr100">African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://www.unccd.int/our-work/ggwi">Great Green Wall Initiative</a>. And the European Union’s <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en">regulation on deforestation-free products</a>, while a worthy endeavor, is unlikely to fix the imbalance. </p>
<p data-line-id="10037d07f17e4fbdadfcc40c1bf82f6b"> That is because focusing solely on the rainforest is not sufficient to save it. Investments that boost agricultural productivity, raise housing standards, and improve territorial planning – with an emphasis on compact, upward growth rather than urban sprawl – are essential to preserve the Congo Basin rainforest and prevent ecosystem collapse. </p>
<p data-line-id="b13bd1417d1c4861a92b12fc1d967b4a"> Increasing crop yields and building better cities are not only among the most cost-effective strategies for climate-change adaptation; they also bring significant economic and social benefits. Moreover, by striking the right balance between immediate needs and long-term sustainability, investments in these areas can help Africa manage its demographic pressures without risking the planet’s future. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c8c0a94dbfd45f38b63d1d1a670c29a"> For decades, African governments relied on cash crops and timber exports to build their foreign-exchange reserves, valuing growth and macroeconomic stability over sustainable development. African households are increasingly taking a similar approach, prioritizing basic needs over climate and environmental considerations. But in an era defined by the global climate crisis, Africans should not be forced into such a Cornelian dilemma. </p>
<p data-line-id="1e38112a84754e81b09595db13256260"> As the continent faces rapid population growth, continuing down this path would be destructive for the planet and everyone on it. To reduce the risk of crossing climate tipping points, the world must improve living standards in Africa. It is a price that must be paid to avert a climate disaster. </p>

<p data-line-id="82e87751e23043c5b4e28b1f8e3cc4bc"> LONDON – <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>’ <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">call</a> for the United Nations to pivot from climate action focused on temperature goals to vaccines has misread the challenge we face. Investments in climate mitigation and development are not competing priorities. On the contrary, with the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health">projecting</a> that climate change will cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, climate action is also health action. </p><p data-line-id="d270650965bf44a78b2b978d31dffc25"> All those attending the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém this week should keep this insight in mind. But Gates is right that we must deliver real solutions, and, as the Brazilian government has made clear, the goal for this “Solutions COP” is to bridge the gap between declarations and delivery, which will require allocating scarce resources effectively. This is not about trade-offs between climate and health: it is about getting serious about our goals. </p><p data-line-id="9845dc064a274cf9966c954c1543a2ae"> Progress at COP30 is far from assured. The United Kingdom has just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/uk-opts-out-of-flagship-fund-to-protect-amazon-and-other-threatened-tropical-forests">withdrawn</a> its funding for the proposed Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which is supposed to be formally adopted this month. Making matters worse, the European Union has just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/eu-eyes-weaker-climate-goal-scramble-deal-by-cop30-sources-say-2025-11-05/">weakened</a> its 2040 decarbonization target by allowing countries to buy foreign carbon credits rather than cutting domestic emissions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/07/press-release-un-warns-of-soaring-global-public-debt-a-record-92-trillion-in-2022-3-3-billion-people-now-live-in-countries-where-debt-interest-payments-are-greater-than-expenditure-on-health-or-edu/">3.3 billion people</a> live in countries that are spending more on interest payments than on health, implying that they are foregoing investments in climate resilience. </p><p data-line-id="9f1cf13094334c898833e9f1d5ef3548"> Ten years after COP21 in Paris, the world is not short of targets or stated commitments. Rather, what is missing is the ability to deliver fast, fair, and durable progress. From debt sustainability and climate change to the pursuit of inclusive growth, the common thread running through all our biggest challenges is public institutions’ inability to turn commitments into tangible outcomes. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="1687ed8e42bb4b88b5b982e9da2a210d"> As a result, we are left treading water. Cutting debt while undermining investment-led growth will not bring about debt sustainability, but it will exacerbate the climate crisis. After all, the debt crisis is also an investment crisis – without investment, the productive capacity of countries does not increase, making them more dependent on foreign aid precisely when that aid is withering. </p><p data-line-id="a45ffb0d028f416885febfe27be3c055"> To find our way back to shore, we urgently need a new financial architecture that can provide the policy and fiscal space to support implementation and build state capacity. While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are attempting to reimagine themselves for the 21st century, they must move faster to accommodate carbon-related constraints and persistent development deficits. Here, too, ambition has outpaced execution: pledges abound, but governance and public-purpose finance are still bottlenecks. </p><p data-line-id="dfe01e1b093542a0ac2dc00f0e8c03cf"> Moreover, countries must commit to investing in their ability to administer and implement the much-needed industrial and financial strategies that can put the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at the center of economic development – such as by embedding climate goals in green industrial strategies and green financial policies. At COP30 this week, I will be presenting a way to use <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2025/nov/mission-oriented-country-platforms-engines-just-green-transition">country platforms</a> more effectively. More than just a tool for derisking the private sector, country platforms must be used in a way that makes government climate policy greater than the sum of its parts. </p><p data-line-id="2690ad71554143b9b55ccf95127d4976"> As I argue in a new report, “<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2025/nov/state-capacity-and-capabilities-just-green-world">State Capacity and Capabilities for a Just Green World</a>,” with Esther Dweck, Brazil’s minister of management and innovation in public services, governments must invest in their own capacity. This means ensuring all tools – including procurement policy, digital public infrastructure, and the design of state-owned enterprises – are fit for purpose. Building dynamic state capabilities means investing in policy labs, learning by doing, and becoming less reliant on outside consultants. Brazil’s <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en">Pix payment system</a> and Rural Environmental Registry show what becomes possible when governments invest in the data collection, systems, and skills needed to turn plans into results. </p><p data-line-id="8023b27491bc4c6bae9a234e969cfa4a"> Most developing countries need additional support to build these capabilities and fulfill their NDCs, and a new financial architecture should be supportive of that objective. Investments in state capacity should be understood as among the most effective forms of climate policy. When designed as mission-oriented implementation hubs, country platforms can align public instruments behind clear goals, with state-owned enterprises, public development banks, and strategic procurement agencies working in concert. </p><p data-line-id="8acd53d1206d46778fb6a0e1e3513327"> Gates is right that temperature goals alone are not the best measure of human welfare. But he is wrong to turn away from bold climate action that emphasizes ambitious mitigation rather than passive adaptation. In the spirit of Brazil’s call for this to be a Solutions COP, climate finance must be spent on the right things: building the state capacity needed to implement green industrial strategies that align decarbonization with development, health, jobs, and resilience. </p>

<p data-line-id="ffec063a18b84136a6ef1d320b4ebeb3"> BERLIN – It is hard to imagine a more appropriate venue for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30). Delegations from around the world will gather in the equatorial Brazilian city of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon – one of the front lines of climate vulnerability. Some 40% of the city’s population lives below sea level, and around <a href="https://sumauma.com/en/na-belem-da-cop30-ate-a-sombra-e-desigual/">82% of residents</a> walk on streets with no shade. Heat and humidity define their daily life, and nature directly sustains their existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="34827b479a8e42e98a08aba7b19f6899"> But as COP30 gets underway, there is no point in pretending that governments are rising to the occasion. The UN Environment Programme’s latest emissions gap <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2025">report</a> makes clear that without stronger governmental action, we will inevitably see temperature levels at which crops fail, cities overheat, economies falter, and the human toll soars. This is the reality that policymakers will confront in Belém, and they should feel a sense of collective responsibility to confront the alarming gap between what countries have put on the table and what is urgently required. Getting to climate safety will not be easy. But acknowledging how far we have come should inspire hope that we can make it the rest of the way. From 2005-15, oil, gas, and coal power generation met <a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2025/10-years-post-paris">68% of the growth</a> in global electricity demand. From 2015-25, renewables met <a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2025/10-years-post-paris">67% of the increase</a> in demand. </p>
<p data-line-id="e7374f2c2a1146ca84f02b712f24b82f"> In China, President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.climateandcapitalmedia.com/clean-energy-is-the-cornerstone-of-xi-jinpings-five-year-plan/">says</a> he wants to use the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan to “accelerate” the construction of a new energy system and promote the safe, reliable, and orderly replacement of fossil energy. In India, renewables met <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2183866">51.5% of total electricity demand in July</a> this year. And in the European Union, GDP grew by about 68% between 1990 and 2023, while net greenhouse-gas emissions decreased <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-other-reads/news/eu-advances-towards-2030-climate-targets-continued-emissions-cuts-2025-11-06_en">by approximately 37%</a>, according to preliminary data. </p>
<p data-line-id="bf77d79c44fe49d3a5ffc22bbd5806b5"> The falling costs of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage clear the path for governments, civil society, and regional and municipal leaders to tackle the challenge of climate safety. The alternative, apathy and defeat, is no alternative at all. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4ceb10784de4fec86e7257f4a252672"> So, what needs to happen at COP30? First, governments must reaffirm the Paris agreement and its goal of keeping the global average temperature within 2°C, and preferably within 1.5°C, of the pre-industrial level. With the Trump administration actively working to slow the phaseout of fossil fuels, confirming this target will send an important signal to investors and planners around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="6027a6b2edc5413aba429edc87440630"> Second, governments must accelerate implementation of what has already been agreed. The 2023 <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">Global Stocktake</a> in Dubai called on countries to triple renewable energy capacity, double energy efficiency, promote a just transition away from fossil fuels, and halt (and then reverse) deforestation by 2030. Agreement on these goals was hard-won; now they must be pursued with the necessary speed and scale. </p>
<p data-line-id="ccf3352151a54e1a9ddbdbdf011da20f"> As Brazilian President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> suggested on the first day of COP30, governments <a href="https://www.gov.br/planalto/pt-br/acompanhe-o-planalto/discursos-e-pronunciamentos/2025/11/discurso-do-presidente-lula-na-abertura-da-cop30-em-belem-pa">could create a roadmap</a> detailing various pathways to a just transition away from fossil fuels, which would require an agreement on what a just transition must include. They could supplement this with initiatives to overcome barriers to renewables, such as commitments to invest in electric grids and battery storage. And a similar approach could lay out a path to achieving zero deforestation by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="840b90b6aa1a4d698967382127cf0764"> As the host of COP30, the Brazilian government is already <a href="https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/cop30-action-agenda-calls-for-accelerating-the-implementation-of-the-global-stocktake">calling</a> for the summit to “accelerate the implementation of the Global Stocktake.” We need to turn that catchphrase into concrete progress by adopting a forward-looking game plan that identifies the pathways, policies, and supporting measures needed to close the gap to the Paris agreement’s 1.5°C target. </p>
<p data-line-id="5a3f789a98934cc9a4401c9278c68a51"> But redoubling our efforts is not only about accelerating progress where it is lagging; it is also about taking advantage of the pace of the transformation that is well underway – delivering jobs and economic growth – in many places. The progress made in recent years has been unmistakable: wind and solar power <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/renewable-additions-in-2025-are-once-again-expected-to-surge-putting-tripling-within-reach/tracking-progress-towards-a-global-tripling-of-ren/">have more than tripled since 2015</a>, and EVs have grown from less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2">1% back then to over 20%</a> today.  </p>
<p data-line-id="4fa909d1681d4fff8d693b95eaa17be0"> Third, countries should demonstrate how they intend to align the steps they are taking today with what is needed to reach net-zero emissions. This matters because several countries have recently offered new climate commitments that <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/2025-ndc-synthesis-report">seem to fall short of meeting their own net-zero goals</a>, whether by 2050 or later. </p>
<p data-line-id="5e836f2f4ddc4b4296195098484b1cf5"> Of course, access to finance and investment remains essential for developing countries to decarbonize and bolster climate resilience. COP30 can make real progress by securing commitments to mobilize more resources for vulnerable countries to help them adapt to rising sea levels, strong storms, prolonged heat waves, and other consequences of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="b9a8f519b8164f34ab07968fa440abcc"> The Brazilian hosts have set an ambitious agenda, but the defining test will be whether the world takes steps to close the widening gap to the 1.5°C goal. For Lula, securing a win would solidify his legacy as a champion for the people around the world who stand to suffer the most if we fail. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="df5e4b1de960450e88236e7b7b81fa32"> SINGAPORE – Ahead of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), now underway in Belém, Brazil, Bill Gates, who chairs and funds the foundation that bears his name, released an essay entitled “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">Three tough truths about climate</a>.” The first of these truths is: “Climate change is a serious problem, but it will not be the end of civilization.” </p>
<p data-line-id="663fe79e47c446c3b10dd5a846eea941"> Gates recognizes that climate change is “a very important problem,” that it “needs to be solved,” and that “[e]very tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.” Nevertheless, to say that climate change will not be the end of civilization must lessen our sense of the urgency of acting to mitigate it. So, we should ask whether this “truth” really is true. </p>
<p data-line-id="0dc2dc2fcb194771b3f1180fa37f0010"> Gates defends his flat statement that climate change “will not be the end of civilization” with a graph showing that even if countries do no more than continue what they are doing now, “Global warming will probably be less than 3°C by 2100.” More precisely, the graph suggests that by 2100, with countries continuing to do what they are doing now, the global average temperature will be 2.9°C above the pre-industrial level. </p>
<p data-line-id="a4bef354441d409d9c4bddd70a2be942"> Suppose we agree that, although a global temperature rise of 2.9°C would make some parts of our planet uninhabitable because of extreme heat or rising sea levels, enough will still be suitable for human habitation to allow civilization to continue. The question remains: Will the temperature rise stop at 2.9°C? </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="1ead6d376d8d41629a1608ca05f7343f"> To make the case that it will, Gates gives a detailed account of technological innovations that, he believes, could enable us to move to zero emissions before the end of the century. But he misses something critically important. To see this, let’s take a step back. </p>
<p data-line-id="3e38dce1b22343af869688cabe718b87"> The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has been signed by 198 parties, including all United Nations member states, dates from the “Earth Summit” held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Article 2 of the convention states that its ultimate objective is to achieve “stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” </p>
<p data-line-id="7f360c9d38594bb4b205a7d21e0ccc37"> The convention did not put any specific limit on how much global warming could be tolerated without dangerous anthropogenic interference with our climate. Countries had different views about that, and the science was still developing. </p>
<p data-line-id="2680ca37889d4241a10db087e413a9a3"> Eighteen years later, however, at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP16), in Cancún, the science was sufficiently advanced for it to be agreed that to avoid danger, global warming must be limited to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Then, in 2015, with further evidence showing the threat of sea-level rise to low-lying island states, the agreement was further refined at COP21 in Paris to hold the increase to “well below” 2°C while “pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.” </p>
<p data-line-id="c19e518359874caaafbeb8ad096b1b5f"> All the criticism of the 2°C limit has been on the side of saying that it is too high. For example, a two-year expert review <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/sb/eng/inf01.pdf">reported</a> to the UNFCCC in 2015 that “the ‘guardrail’ concept, in which up to 2°C of warming is considered safe, is inadequate, and would therefore be better seen as an upper limit, a defence line that needs to be stringently defended, while less warming would be preferable.” </p>
<p data-line-id="c0f2612b3f1e4d0fb8701e0ff7cfe086"> No major country, nor any authoritative expert body, has suggested that we could safely raise the 2°C limit. The main reason for this is not that civilization will be unable to survive in a world that is 2°C warmer than the pre-industrial world was, or that, as Gates points out, it is easier to improve people’s lives when the climate is stable. </p>
<p data-line-id="c51b6f5ac930400188f360626b3e0d44"> Instead, the main reason is that once global warming exceeds 2°C, the risk of activating positive feedback loops increases significantly. These loops may further increase global temperatures even if we have, thanks to the technological innovations Gates mentions, reduced to zero the emissions for which humans are directly responsible. </p>
<p data-line-id="93269eea2086424ba9623d33006dc678"> Three of these feedback loops are particularly important: </p>
<ul data-line-id="be94d1ef2fa44c6e81be01ecdf381a11"><ul><li>Immense quantities of carbon are locked up in organic matter, now frozen in arctic permafrost. Above 2°C, there is a high risk that the organic matter will thaw rapidly and decompose, releasing carbon dioxide and methane (a much more potent greenhouse gas), which would increase global warming and cause further thawing;</li><li>Ice, whether on land or the ocean, reflects the sun’s radiation. Once the ice sheets of Greenland, Antarctica, and the Arctic Ocean start to melt, the darker land and water surfaces that are exposed will absorb more of the sun’s warmth, causing more ice to melt;</li><li>The Amazon rainforest is another huge store of carbon. As temperatures rise above 2°C, the forest may begin to die, releasing its stored carbon into the atmosphere.<br/></li></ul></ul>
<p data-line-id="6229058b5e7a452ab690c6c52718e842"> When we include these and other reinforcing loops in our calculations, we cannot easily brush aside the threat climate change poses to the future of civilization. </p>
<p data-line-id="c8f19872c4164735b45d6fa645972ba5"> Gates seeks to de-emphasize the existential threat posed by climate change in order to “put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies.” But this doesn’t tell us how tolerant we should be of the risk of creating a climate that will be disastrous for human welfare for centuries to come. Tolerating 2.9°C of warming by 2100 may, in the long run, be far worse for human welfare than doing everything possible to keep warming below 2°C. </p>

But space is no longer simply about exploration and innovation. It has become a front line for security, particularly for Europe. Just days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Russian <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/cipr/items/740427/en">cyberattack</a> took down a satellite network providing critical connectivity to Europe. And now, both Russia and China are developing weapons to jam, overwhelm, and destroy Europe’s satellites. </p>

<p data-line-id="f14483dffcc04ff79c04f9ae74f492b4"> MANAGUA – When indigenous peoples are mentioned in the context of climate change, my mind immediately goes to images of my grandmother’s roofless and flooded house, destroyed by a Category 5 hurricane and a Category 4 storm in quick succession. </p><p data-line-id="0dfed58470d04095a0251fa05eedc10e"> I also move beyond the personal, thinking of the extreme weather swings in the Andes that are damaging agricultural production; the Maasai families in Kenya and Tanzania watching their livestock die from droughts or, increasingly, massive floods; and the communities devastated by landslides in the Philippines’ Cordillera mountains. </p><p data-line-id="a665d13bf8cf4ef1b5f00eb9d31a0a43"> For indigenous peoples, climate change is more than figures and charts; it is a wound that festers, eating away at our land, resources, spirituality, and culture. The extreme weather events that are growing more frequent and severe <a href="https://desapublications.un.org/publications/state-worlds-indigenous-peoples-volume-vi-climate-crisis">disproportionately harm</a> our communities because we rely directly on natural ecosystems. </p><p data-line-id="78c3dbff41b043c981d744255bea8be4"> The decision to hold this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in the Amazon region has raised our expectations significantly. To be sure, the road to Belém has not been easy. We are hopeful about the proceedings, while also approaching them with the caution and clarity that come from having taken part in climate negotiations many times before, only to be ignored. </p><p data-line-id="31f99bf184a94f2d85acca386e928666"> These summits are dominated by national policymakers. Still, we have always insisted that our voices be heard – even from the margins – and will continue to do so. Our aspiration is not only to be invited to the negotiating table and given a say in decision-making, but to help create a collective space where everyone can participate as a valued stakeholder. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="1c872c35c0a34cb0afb15fd1017eeb8f"> With <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/11/10/cop30-what-to-expect-from-this-years-un-climate-talks">more than 3,000</a> indigenous people from Africa, the Arctic, Asia, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe expected to attend COP30, the Global Caucus of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change has developed positions on the summit’s main themes. Whether discussing action on climate finance, adaptation, or mitigation, our rights to self-determination and free, prior, and informed consent concerning all matters affecting our lands, territories, and resources must be recognized. These are not favors or nice-to-haves, but the essential principles of a just climate transition. </p><p data-line-id="61b67b6c71ec4f66b873bab2ea2a31b8"> As COP30’s host, Brazil seeks to make it the “<a href="https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/pre-cop-concludes-with-progress-toward-consensus-on-implementing-agreements-and-strengthening-adaptation">COP of implementation</a>,” which means translating commitments into robust action: capacity and technology transfers, as well as finance that actually reaches those on the front lines of climate change. </p><p data-line-id="b9eb56690d2b4cdba32d86a191cf5c7a"> For indigenous peoples, implementing climate policies requires direct access to predictable and sustainable finance. Instead of being forced to depend on intermediaries who leave us with crumbs, we should be trusted to manage the funds ourselves, allocating them based on our own needs, timelines, and knowledge systems. The problem with climate finance is not a lack of capacity but a lack of trust and political will. </p><p data-line-id="ccf14f783657485081c39da4b9b48197"> Moreover, multilateralism – touted as the path to climate salvation – is often skewed in favor of wealthy countries and influential stakeholders. We need partners who treat us as such, rather than as beneficiaries, who recognize our governance structures, support our initiatives, conduct cultural due diligence, and, above all, encourage genuine dialogue. </p><p data-line-id="6db1309904ad44e68083830f0cccefee"> In debates about how to ensure a just transition, we will continue to stress that clean-energy projects must not be built at the expense of our dispossession. Without strong safeguards, the decarbonization process risks becoming yet another <a href="https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sacrifice-Zones-final-layout.pdf">cycle of extractivism</a>. Respect for indigenous peoples’ rights to land and resources must be at the heart of any climate policy. </p><p data-line-id="1575bda2cafb4a5385ecef3b968310ef"> Likewise, adaptation and mitigation must be approached holistically. We cannot continue to measure success only by carbon sequestration; we must also consider the effects of these efforts on livelihoods, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab68a9#erlab68a9s3">mental and spiritual health</a>, and the cultural continuity of indigenous peoples. </p><p data-line-id="d2e7a5ff5a024684aafb3e53bbed110e"> Governments and other institutions must be held accountable at COP30 for the promises they have made over the years. Words should become tangible commitments, particularly in regard to providing indigenous peoples with direct access to finance. This will require a decisive shift in mindset: climate action must do good, not merely avoid harm. </p><p data-line-id="62c3d94eebc44bfabcce130583d1595b"> Indigenous peoples, when viewed from this perspective, are part of the solution. Caring for the planet is embedded in our knowledge systems – restoring a forest, protecting a lagoon, and preserving traditional seeds are everyday tasks for us. But to carry out this work, we need real recognition and support from the international community. </p>

<p data-line-id="406cf7297fab47c7879b36d181db5065"> NEW YORK – America’s role in international aid has been turned upside down since January, with institutions shuttered, policies upended, and funding slashed. It is now unclear what lies ahead for American policy, the international aid system, or the world’s poorest. All we know is that a massive gap needs to be filled. </p>

<p data-line-id="6f66fb8fb69c42f99b3a52e818f7f0ca"> MILAN – During a recent trip to Kazakhstan, I was struck by people’s enthusiasm for AI. Virtually everyone I encountered – including academics, policymakers, and entrepreneurs – seemed convinced that the technology will help solve thorny challenges, from diversifying the economy away from dependence on natural resources to expanding access to critical services, particularly for remote populations. I had expected the diffusion of knowledge about AI to be slower, but perhaps their positivity should not have surprised me. After all, the rapid development of AI implies important opportunities for emerging economies. </p>
