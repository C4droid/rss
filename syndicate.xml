says that in Argentina and China, the US has created two problems of its own making.        </p>

<p data-line-id="b609e6e5cfc04cf38eeed81bbf076aea"> MANCHESTER – When it comes to US foreign economic policy, President Donald Trump’s administration has two problems on its hands. Following what has become something of a pattern for this administration, both problems are of its own making. </p>
<p data-line-id="25116a113bbb4df49ab36ac45b66634f"> In South America, Trump &amp; Co. are heavily exposed to a dubious effort to stabilize the Argentine peso, a task to which they have committed more than $20 billion. In Asia, they are engaged in an on-again-off-again trade war with China, in which Chinese President Xi Jinping has the upper hand. </p>
<p data-line-id="14355de4541a4063b8111686cdaaebfd"> Argentia’s President Javier Milei has made good on his promise to take a chainsaw to his country’s budget deficit. But to reinforce the fall in inflation, he has propped up the peso’s dollar exchange rate, which has hurt exports and slowed economic growth, leading to uncomfortably <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com,2025:newsml_S0N3UB034:0-argentina-s-unemployment-rate-holds-steady-at-7-6-in-second-quarter/">high unemployment</a>. </p>
<p data-line-id="16645c1d1c8b4ed085e2baa9e855a468"> The question is whether a restive public will continue to support Milei’s policies indefinitely. History suggests that it will not, notwithstanding last month’s legislative elections, which provided a temporary respite. </p>
<p data-line-id="9a9a20a358644d2089e5309ae3926fad"> Temporary is the operative word: public opinion could turn again. To paraphrase my Berkeley colleague <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/maurice-obstfeld">Maurice Obstfeld</a>, Argentina is a <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/americas-argentina-rescue-wont-save-peso-long">graveyard</a> of unsuccessful exchange-rate-based stabilizations. More than once, variants of this policy have collapsed in a heap of political dysfunction. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="ec35bb4d16cc4e808bd908e48e3b4de0"> Given this, Milei’s strategy also creates doubts about whether Argentina can repay the US Treasury. Senior creditors like the International Monetary Fund, which went into Argentina earlier, stand to be paid first out of the country’s limited foreign exchange. The money the US Treasury pumps into Argentina is likely to just leak back out in repayments to hedge funds that scooped up Argentina’s bonds on the cheap. Even if Argentina somehow repays the US Treasury but the government falters in the 2027 election, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who made supporting Milei official US policy, will be left with egg on his face. </p>
<p data-line-id="0f6983c5c1d146958f389f9b05f9c3ec"> In the case of China, Trump thought he had a leg up in any trade dispute because the US buys more from China than China buys from the US. And because the US is the more advanced designer of cutting-edge semiconductors, Trump thought he had more leverage from export embargoes than anything China could threaten. </p>
<p data-line-id="1223bf06cdbb484a9f7b108f5456780f"> The reality, of course, is the opposite. China can simply divert its exports of merchandise and commodities from the US to other parts of the world, as it had begun doing even before Trump’s return to the White House. It can import advanced semiconductors from third parties or soup up last year’s model. And when provoked by the addition of more Chinese companies to the US Entity List, the blacklist of companies barred from access to advanced technology, China can embargo exports of the rare earths that are essential inputs for consumer electronics, motor vehicles, and, not least, US military hardware. </p>
<p data-line-id="478c7f0ff91541c3b68c3c9ab576bfa5"> Seen in this light, Trump’s climbdown following his recent meeting with Xi is no surprise. Xi made an empty commitment to buy more American soybeans, just as he has in the past. He suspended his rare-earth embargo but left that sword of Damocles hanging. Trump for his part agreed to scale back his punitive tariffs, suspend port fees on Chinese ships, and delay the planned expansion of the Entity List that had provoked China into threatening rare-earth controls in the first place. </p>
<p data-line-id="16812e1d96bf4d9c8738d955a64fc928"> Importantly, this negotiation sets a pattern for the future. The next time Trump threatens China with tariffs, port charges, or export controls, Xi will threaten rare-earth export controls, and Trump will chicken out. China’s rare-earth monopoly won’t last forever, but it will outlast the Trump administration. </p>
<p data-line-id="7831cf663e5647ba9aa2c1599751f5a5"> In the case of Argentina, where it was a mistake to make an unconditional commitment in the first place, the Trump administration should require the Milei government, as a condition of continued US support, to allow the peso to depreciate, eliminating its overvaluation, after which the currency should be allowed to float more freely. Argentine producers will then be able to export more, helping to stabilize growth and employment while ensuring that the government can repay what it borrowed. </p>
<p data-line-id="60ee7e40ae574deda1dd84930f1b163a"> Admittedly, inflation will come down somewhat more slowly than previously programmed, because import prices will rise more rapidly. But disinflation will be more politically sustainable, because it will cause less unemployment and social dislocation. There will be less likelihood of the public repudiating the policy – and Milei – in 2027. </p>
<p data-line-id="a0c1db60d88344e482bc3afcb968bfd1"> Milei has shown no sign of seeing the light, instead <a href="https://ft.pressreader.com/v99e/20251107/281496462540524">doubling down</a> on his risky monetary strategy. And while Bessent, who <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/business/article/scott-bessent-treasury-secretary-husband-trump-kn8nj2nrm">knows his way</a> around currency crises, could force Milei’s hand, he is showing no willingness to do so. </p>
<p data-line-id="db820557248e425085baccef1c114290"> Best of all would be for the US authorities, in their wisdom, not to create this kind of international economic and financial mess in the first place. Don’t hold your breath. </p>

<p data-line-id="6822b0a9d9f645a1a67f6840fac66a1e"> LONDON – The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), now underway in Brazil, marks a decade since 195 parties adopted the landmark Paris climate agreement at COP21. But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/from-billions-to-trillions-setting-a-new-goal-on-climate-finance">trillions of dollars</a>, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing. </p><p data-line-id="eb5c4554993c48f687f8eec2e6367639"> The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks. </p><p data-line-id="34a307d24aa944879780748e1f49e5c4"> The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/promising-new-technologies-face-market-uncertainty-in-pivotal-moment-for-global-energy-innovation">warned</a> that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-state-of-energy-innovation/executive-summary">declined</a> across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="347f63bffcf34424a30931fef7c2d97b"> While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities. </p><p data-line-id="aab6bbd009b443d1b086186935f021bc"> From its very inception, the <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/">Council for Inclusive Capitalism</a> (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">call</a> to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/just-energy-transition-home/">just climate transition</a>. </p><p data-line-id="0d90eabba43c4ff3871d27960c3b7c93"> Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices. </p><p data-line-id="224c98979fbe4b58a23fb16b5d1ddef0"> Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/unga-80-climate-week-2025/">meeting</a> with World Bank President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ajay-banga">Ajay Banga</a> at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind. </p><p data-line-id="4da1854df1b545a69996894d3be336b1"> Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/investing-in-climate-for-growth-and-development_16b7cbc7-en.html">joint report</a> by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale. </p><p data-line-id="ca81660fb7824eef8ccf5fa2e463447b"> Other emerging markets are also <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">making strides</a>. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s <a href="https://etedge-insights.com/industry/energy/india-takes-giant-leap-to-become-worlds-second-largest-renewable-energy-market-by-2030-iea-report/">second-largest renewable-energy market</a> after China. For developing countries, <a href="https://www.inclusivecapitalism.com/news-insights/2025-steering-committee-meeting/">inclusive growth</a> is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="93976b0f0a5b4a96b0bd7bd9aef4936c"> Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a>’s industrial and climate policies were already <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c">experiencing delays</a> even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32r5k43vwo">jeopardizing</a> the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms. </p><p data-line-id="5dcac16330fb42a392b930c20a72a6cc"> Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs. </p><p data-line-id="9ffd97bb64624c649d91c194eee16faf"> The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet. </p>

<p data-line-id="5fe51840c7a445e7a6d112dbcc1340c8"> WASHINGTON, DC – The international community is quick to highlight Africa’s development challenges and failures, often citing the continent’s limited progress on poverty reduction and climate action. </p>
<p data-line-id="945fc1e49d43480080419484efce9fca"> Consider the persistent focus on Africa’s massive climate-finance gap, estimated at around <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/climate-finance-needs-of-african-countries/">$2.8 trillion</a> between 2020 and 2030, and its unsustainable debt burden, with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) now <a href="https://drgr.org/news/paying-for-the-past-or-investing-in-the-future-africas-debt-and-climate-dilemma/">spending more</a> on debt service than it receives in climate finance. Much attention has also been devoted to African countries’ disappointing progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The continent is on track to achieve <a href="https://sdg.iisd.org/news/report-makes-recommendations-to-accelerate-sdgs-in-africa-agenda-2063/">only 6%</a> of the 32 measurable SDG targets by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="6f5adafbf89b4547b1b0bab5b82a7b2e"> But these challenges are compounded by the lack of international development support. Nowhere is the gap between rhetoric and action more evident than in efforts to achieve <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">SDG 15</a>, which aims to protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including by combating deforestation. From 2010 to 2020, Africa had the world’s <a href="https://www.fao.org/interactive/forest-resources-assessment/2020/en/">largest annual rate of net forest loss</a>, averaging 3.9 million hectares. Given the scale of the problem, the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém must adopt a more proactive and comprehensive strategy to prevent deforestation and curb related environmental risks. </p>
<p data-line-id="3beece83c58f45a1b1fe1b3765389077"> A wide array of proven interventions – many seen as beyond the realm of climate policy – could protect millions of hectares of forest in Africa each year, especially in the Congo Basin, one of the most essential global commons. Home to the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2025/10/20/congo-basin-forests-hold-trillions-in-untapped-value-new-report-calls-for-strategic-global-investment">second-largest tropical rainforest</a>, the Congo Basin absorbs nearly <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/critical-ecosystems-congo-basin-peatlands">1.5 billion tons</a> of carbon dioxide annually and is a biodiversity hotspot, with roughly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/congo-basin/">10,000 species of tropical plants</a>, 30% of which are unique to the region. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="53102ab4d2a0497bb2b4f76e04b24bde"> Preserving the Congo Basin is especially important because the insatiable global demand for Africa’s natural resources has decimated the continent’s forests. This process began in the 19th and early 20th centuries, as European imperial powers exported timber and cleared vast swaths of old-growth forest for cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, palm oil, tea, and rubber. It has continued and even intensified in recent years, driven by demographic pressures and rising Asian demand for raw materials. As a result, tropical Africa has lost <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/05/deforestation-africa">around 22%</a> of its forested area since 1900 – comparable to the more widely publicized losses in the Amazon. </p>
<p data-line-id="70dfd877e3e34059acd921e9cbdb6258"> Deforestation is fast approaching a tipping point in the Congo Basin. Between 2002 and 2024, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which contains <a href="https://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/our-projects/where-we-work/drc/">about 60%</a> of the Congo Basin rainforest, lost <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/COD/">7.4 million hectares</a> of humid primary forest, which accounted for 36% of its total tree cover loss. If current deforestation rates persist, large portions of the Congo Basin <a href="https://www.forestsnews.org/79903/over-a-quarter-of-congo-basin-forests-at-risk-of-vanishing-by-2050">could disappear</a> by 2050, with dire consequences for global climate stability. </p>
<p data-line-id="ea15ae50fd644a079ab8039fac5a14b6"> Importantly, the world’s insatiable appetite for Africa’s natural resources is not the only driver of deforestation. Subsistence farming and increased housing demand, especially in rapidly growing urban areas, have also led to large-scale land-clearing, owing mainly to low agricultural productivity and poor territorial planning. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc65c66b1034cf3a7f343d1ac9fe480"> In many African countries, crop yields reach <a href="https://news.unl.edu/article/yield-gap-study-highlights-potential-for-higher-crop-yields-in-africa">only 20-30%</a> of their potential because of the lack of irrigation (currently less than 5% of cultivated land in SSA is irrigated), sparse use of fertilizers and high-quality seed varieties, and <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/feeding-africa-how-small-scale-irrigation-can-help-farmers-change-game/">inadequate access to technology</a>. To meet the nutrition needs of a fast-growing population that is expected to reach <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/09/PT-african-century">2.5 billion</a> by 2050, farmers often compensate for low crop yields by clearing more land and resorting to reduced fallow periods. </p>
<p data-line-id="c10f725c89cb47f8945726440ecddab2"> Unplanned urbanization is equally harmful. Poor housing standards and the proliferation of low-quality single-family homes that lack basic amenities have triggered urban sprawl. Many African cities – from Lagos and Douala to Kinshasa and Kibera – are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264837722000060">growing out, not up</a>, with millions of hectares of forest cleared to make room for such dwellings. Compounding these pressures is the fact that <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/72270">more than 70%</a> of households in SSA still use wood for cooking and heating, leading to even more environmental degradation. This amplifies the negative long-term effects that poor urban planning has on the climate. </p>
<p data-line-id="ac5278e45c364b1faba5d502ffaffd8d"> Although world leaders declared their commitment to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation at <a href="https://www.ciwem.org/news/cop26-100-world-leaders-commit-to-halt-and-reverse-forest-loss-by-2030">previous COPs</a>, deforestation in Africa continues to outpace restoration efforts, including those by the <a href="https://www.wri.org/initiatives/african-forest-landscape-restoration-initiative-afr100">African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://www.unccd.int/our-work/ggwi">Great Green Wall Initiative</a>. And the European Union’s <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/forests/deforestation/regulation-deforestation-free-products_en">regulation on deforestation-free products</a>, while a worthy endeavor, is unlikely to fix the imbalance. </p>
<p data-line-id="10037d07f17e4fbdadfcc40c1bf82f6b"> That is because focusing solely on the rainforest is not sufficient to save it. Investments that boost agricultural productivity, raise housing standards, and improve territorial planning – with an emphasis on compact, upward growth rather than urban sprawl – are essential to preserve the Congo Basin rainforest and prevent ecosystem collapse. </p>
<p data-line-id="b13bd1417d1c4861a92b12fc1d967b4a"> Increasing crop yields and building better cities are not only among the most cost-effective strategies for climate-change adaptation; they also bring significant economic and social benefits. Moreover, by striking the right balance between immediate needs and long-term sustainability, investments in these areas can help Africa manage its demographic pressures without risking the planet’s future. </p>
<p data-line-id="8c8c0a94dbfd45f38b63d1d1a670c29a"> For decades, African governments relied on cash crops and timber exports to build their foreign-exchange reserves, valuing growth and macroeconomic stability over sustainable development. African households are increasingly taking a similar approach, prioritizing basic needs over climate and environmental considerations. But in an era defined by the global climate crisis, Africans should not be forced into such a Cornelian dilemma. </p>
<p data-line-id="1e38112a84754e81b09595db13256260"> As the continent faces rapid population growth, continuing down this path would be destructive for the planet and everyone on it. To reduce the risk of crossing climate tipping points, the world must improve living standards in Africa. It is a price that must be paid to avert a climate disaster. </p>

<p data-line-id="82e87751e23043c5b4e28b1f8e3cc4bc"> LONDON – <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>’ <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">call</a> for the United Nations to pivot from climate action focused on temperature goals to vaccines has misread the challenge we face. Investments in climate mitigation and development are not competing priorities. On the contrary, with the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health">projecting</a> that climate change will cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, climate action is also health action. </p><p data-line-id="d270650965bf44a78b2b978d31dffc25"> All those attending the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém this week should keep this insight in mind. But Gates is right that we must deliver real solutions, and, as the Brazilian government has made clear, the goal for this “Solutions COP” is to bridge the gap between declarations and delivery, which will require allocating scarce resources effectively. This is not about trade-offs between climate and health: it is about getting serious about our goals. </p><p data-line-id="9845dc064a274cf9966c954c1543a2ae"> Progress at COP30 is far from assured. The United Kingdom has just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/uk-opts-out-of-flagship-fund-to-protect-amazon-and-other-threatened-tropical-forests">withdrawn</a> its funding for the proposed Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which is supposed to be formally adopted this month. Making matters worse, the European Union has just <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/eu-eyes-weaker-climate-goal-scramble-deal-by-cop30-sources-say-2025-11-05/">weakened</a> its 2040 decarbonization target by allowing countries to buy foreign carbon credits rather than cutting domestic emissions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2023/07/press-release-un-warns-of-soaring-global-public-debt-a-record-92-trillion-in-2022-3-3-billion-people-now-live-in-countries-where-debt-interest-payments-are-greater-than-expenditure-on-health-or-edu/">3.3 billion people</a> live in countries that are spending more on interest payments than on health, implying that they are foregoing investments in climate resilience. </p><p data-line-id="9f1cf13094334c898833e9f1d5ef3548"> Ten years after COP21 in Paris, the world is not short of targets or stated commitments. Rather, what is missing is the ability to deliver fast, fair, and durable progress. From debt sustainability and climate change to the pursuit of inclusive growth, the common thread running through all our biggest challenges is public institutions’ inability to turn commitments into tangible outcomes. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="1687ed8e42bb4b88b5b982e9da2a210d"> As a result, we are left treading water. Cutting debt while undermining investment-led growth will not bring about debt sustainability, but it will exacerbate the climate crisis. After all, the debt crisis is also an investment crisis – without investment, the productive capacity of countries does not increase, making them more dependent on foreign aid precisely when that aid is withering. </p><p data-line-id="a45ffb0d028f416885febfe27be3c055"> To find our way back to shore, we urgently need a new financial architecture that can provide the policy and fiscal space to support implementation and build state capacity. While the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are attempting to reimagine themselves for the 21st century, they must move faster to accommodate carbon-related constraints and persistent development deficits. Here, too, ambition has outpaced execution: pledges abound, but governance and public-purpose finance are still bottlenecks. </p><p data-line-id="dfe01e1b093542a0ac2dc00f0e8c03cf"> Moreover, countries must commit to investing in their ability to administer and implement the much-needed industrial and financial strategies that can put the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at the center of economic development – such as by embedding climate goals in green industrial strategies and green financial policies. At COP30 this week, I will be presenting a way to use <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2025/nov/mission-oriented-country-platforms-engines-just-green-transition">country platforms</a> more effectively. More than just a tool for derisking the private sector, country platforms must be used in a way that makes government climate policy greater than the sum of its parts. </p><p data-line-id="2690ad71554143b9b55ccf95127d4976"> As I argue in a new report, “<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2025/nov/state-capacity-and-capabilities-just-green-world">State Capacity and Capabilities for a Just Green World</a>,” with Esther Dweck, Brazil’s minister of management and innovation in public services, governments must invest in their own capacity. This means ensuring all tools – including procurement policy, digital public infrastructure, and the design of state-owned enterprises – are fit for purpose. Building dynamic state capabilities means investing in policy labs, learning by doing, and becoming less reliant on outside consultants. Brazil’s <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en">Pix payment system</a> and Rural Environmental Registry show what becomes possible when governments invest in the data collection, systems, and skills needed to turn plans into results. </p><p data-line-id="8023b27491bc4c6bae9a234e969cfa4a"> Most developing countries need additional support to build these capabilities and fulfill their NDCs, and a new financial architecture should be supportive of that objective. Investments in state capacity should be understood as among the most effective forms of climate policy. When designed as mission-oriented implementation hubs, country platforms can align public instruments behind clear goals, with state-owned enterprises, public development banks, and strategic procurement agencies working in concert. </p><p data-line-id="8acd53d1206d46778fb6a0e1e3513327"> Gates is right that temperature goals alone are not the best measure of human welfare. But he is wrong to turn away from bold climate action that emphasizes ambitious mitigation rather than passive adaptation. In the spirit of Brazil’s call for this to be a Solutions COP, climate finance must be spent on the right things: building the state capacity needed to implement green industrial strategies that align decarbonization with development, health, jobs, and resilience. </p>

<p data-line-id="ffec063a18b84136a6ef1d320b4ebeb3"> BERLIN – It is hard to imagine a more appropriate venue for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30). Delegations from around the world will gather in the equatorial Brazilian city of Belém, on the edge of the Amazon – one of the front lines of climate vulnerability. Some 40% of the city’s population lives below sea level, and around <a href="https://sumauma.com/en/na-belem-da-cop30-ate-a-sombra-e-desigual/">82% of residents</a> walk on streets with no shade. Heat and humidity define their daily life, and nature directly sustains their existence. </p>
<p data-line-id="34827b479a8e42e98a08aba7b19f6899"> But as COP30 gets underway, there is no point in pretending that governments are rising to the occasion. The UN Environment Programme’s latest emissions gap <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2025">report</a> makes clear that without stronger governmental action, we will inevitably see temperature levels at which crops fail, cities overheat, economies falter, and the human toll soars. This is the reality that policymakers will confront in Belém, and they should feel a sense of collective responsibility to confront the alarming gap between what countries have put on the table and what is urgently required. Getting to climate safety will not be easy. But acknowledging how far we have come should inspire hope that we can make it the rest of the way. From 2005-15, oil, gas, and coal power generation met <a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2025/10-years-post-paris">68% of the growth</a> in global electricity demand. From 2015-25, renewables met <a href="https://eciu.net/analysis/reports/2025/10-years-post-paris">67% of the increase</a> in demand. </p>
<p data-line-id="e7374f2c2a1146ca84f02b712f24b82f"> In China, President Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.climateandcapitalmedia.com/clean-energy-is-the-cornerstone-of-xi-jinpings-five-year-plan/">says</a> he wants to use the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan to “accelerate” the construction of a new energy system and promote the safe, reliable, and orderly replacement of fossil energy. In India, renewables met <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2183866">51.5% of total electricity demand in July</a> this year. And in the European Union, GDP grew by about 68% between 1990 and 2023, while net greenhouse-gas emissions decreased <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/news-other-reads/news/eu-advances-towards-2030-climate-targets-continued-emissions-cuts-2025-11-06_en">by approximately 37%</a>, according to preliminary data. </p>
<p data-line-id="bf77d79c44fe49d3a5ffc22bbd5806b5"> The falling costs of renewable energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage clear the path for governments, civil society, and regional and municipal leaders to tackle the challenge of climate safety. The alternative, apathy and defeat, is no alternative at all. </p>

<p data-line-id="e4ceb10784de4fec86e7257f4a252672"> So, what needs to happen at COP30? First, governments must reaffirm the Paris agreement and its goal of keeping the global average temperature within 2°C, and preferably within 1.5°C, of the pre-industrial level. With the Trump administration actively working to slow the phaseout of fossil fuels, confirming this target will send an important signal to investors and planners around the world. </p>
<p data-line-id="6027a6b2edc5413aba429edc87440630"> Second, governments must accelerate implementation of what has already been agreed. The 2023 <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/global-stocktake">Global Stocktake</a> in Dubai called on countries to triple renewable energy capacity, double energy efficiency, promote a just transition away from fossil fuels, and halt (and then reverse) deforestation by 2030. Agreement on these goals was hard-won; now they must be pursued with the necessary speed and scale. </p>
<p data-line-id="ccf3352151a54e1a9ddbdbdf011da20f"> As Brazilian President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> suggested on the first day of COP30, governments <a href="https://www.gov.br/planalto/pt-br/acompanhe-o-planalto/discursos-e-pronunciamentos/2025/11/discurso-do-presidente-lula-na-abertura-da-cop30-em-belem-pa">could create a roadmap</a> detailing various pathways to a just transition away from fossil fuels, which would require an agreement on what a just transition must include. They could supplement this with initiatives to overcome barriers to renewables, such as commitments to invest in electric grids and battery storage. And a similar approach could lay out a path to achieving zero deforestation by 2030. </p>
<p data-line-id="840b90b6aa1a4d698967382127cf0764"> As the host of COP30, the Brazilian government is already <a href="https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/cop30-action-agenda-calls-for-accelerating-the-implementation-of-the-global-stocktake">calling</a> for the summit to “accelerate the implementation of the Global Stocktake.” We need to turn that catchphrase into concrete progress by adopting a forward-looking game plan that identifies the pathways, policies, and supporting measures needed to close the gap to the Paris agreement’s 1.5°C target. </p>
<p data-line-id="5a3f789a98934cc9a4401c9278c68a51"> But redoubling our efforts is not only about accelerating progress where it is lagging; it is also about taking advantage of the pace of the transformation that is well underway – delivering jobs and economic growth – in many places. The progress made in recent years has been unmistakable: wind and solar power <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/renewable-additions-in-2025-are-once-again-expected-to-surge-putting-tripling-within-reach/tracking-progress-towards-a-global-tripling-of-ren/">have more than tripled since 2015</a>, and EVs have grown from less than <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-electric-car-markets-2">1% back then to over 20%</a> today.  </p>
<p data-line-id="4fa909d1681d4fff8d693b95eaa17be0"> Third, countries should demonstrate how they intend to align the steps they are taking today with what is needed to reach net-zero emissions. This matters because several countries have recently offered new climate commitments that <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/2025-ndc-synthesis-report">seem to fall short of meeting their own net-zero goals</a>, whether by 2050 or later. </p>
<p data-line-id="5e836f2f4ddc4b4296195098484b1cf5"> Of course, access to finance and investment remains essential for developing countries to decarbonize and bolster climate resilience. COP30 can make real progress by securing commitments to mobilize more resources for vulnerable countries to help them adapt to rising sea levels, strong storms, prolonged heat waves, and other consequences of climate change. </p>
<p data-line-id="b9a8f519b8164f34ab07968fa440abcc"> The Brazilian hosts have set an ambitious agenda, but the defining test will be whether the world takes steps to close the widening gap to the 1.5°C goal. For Lula, securing a win would solidify his legacy as a champion for the people around the world who stand to suffer the most if we fail. </p>

<p data-line-id="df5e4b1de960450e88236e7b7b81fa32"> SINGAPORE – Ahead of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), now underway in Belém, Brazil, Bill Gates, who chairs and funds the foundation that bears his name, released an essay entitled “<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate">Three tough truths about climate</a>.” The first of these truths is: “Climate change is a serious problem, but it will not be the end of civilization.” </p>
<p data-line-id="663fe79e47c446c3b10dd5a846eea941"> Gates recognizes that climate change is “a very important problem,” that it “needs to be solved,” and that “[e]very tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.” Nevertheless, to say that climate change will not be the end of civilization must lessen our sense of the urgency of acting to mitigate it. So, we should ask whether this “truth” really is true. </p>
<p data-line-id="0dc2dc2fcb194771b3f1180fa37f0010"> Gates defends his flat statement that climate change “will not be the end of civilization” with a graph showing that even if countries do no more than continue what they are doing now, “Global warming will probably be less than 3°C by 2100.” More precisely, the graph suggests that by 2100, with countries continuing to do what they are doing now, the global average temperature will be 2.9°C above the pre-industrial level. </p>
<p data-line-id="a4bef354441d409d9c4bddd70a2be942"> Suppose we agree that, although a global temperature rise of 2.9°C would make some parts of our planet uninhabitable because of extreme heat or rising sea levels, enough will still be suitable for human habitation to allow civilization to continue. The question remains: Will the temperature rise stop at 2.9°C? </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="1ead6d376d8d41629a1608ca05f7343f"> To make the case that it will, Gates gives a detailed account of technological innovations that, he believes, could enable us to move to zero emissions before the end of the century. But he misses something critically important. To see this, let’s take a step back. </p>
<p data-line-id="3e38dce1b22343af869688cabe718b87"> The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has been signed by 198 parties, including all United Nations member states, dates from the “Earth Summit” held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Article 2 of the convention states that its ultimate objective is to achieve “stabilization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” </p>
<p data-line-id="7f360c9d38594bb4b205a7d21e0ccc37"> The convention did not put any specific limit on how much global warming could be tolerated without dangerous anthropogenic interference with our climate. Countries had different views about that, and the science was still developing. </p>
<p data-line-id="2680ca37889d4241a10db087e413a9a3"> Eighteen years later, however, at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP16), in Cancún, the science was sufficiently advanced for it to be agreed that to avoid danger, global warming must be limited to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Then, in 2015, with further evidence showing the threat of sea-level rise to low-lying island states, the agreement was further refined at COP21 in Paris to hold the increase to “well below” 2°C while “pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.” </p>
<p data-line-id="c19e518359874caaafbeb8ad096b1b5f"> All the criticism of the 2°C limit has been on the side of saying that it is too high. For example, a two-year expert review <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/sb/eng/inf01.pdf">reported</a> to the UNFCCC in 2015 that “the ‘guardrail’ concept, in which up to 2°C of warming is considered safe, is inadequate, and would therefore be better seen as an upper limit, a defence line that needs to be stringently defended, while less warming would be preferable.” </p>
<p data-line-id="c0f2612b3f1e4d0fb8701e0ff7cfe086"> No major country, nor any authoritative expert body, has suggested that we could safely raise the 2°C limit. The main reason for this is not that civilization will be unable to survive in a world that is 2°C warmer than the pre-industrial world was, or that, as Gates points out, it is easier to improve people’s lives when the climate is stable. </p>
<p data-line-id="c51b6f5ac930400188f360626b3e0d44"> Instead, the main reason is that once global warming exceeds 2°C, the risk of activating positive feedback loops increases significantly. These loops may further increase global temperatures even if we have, thanks to the technological innovations Gates mentions, reduced to zero the emissions for which humans are directly responsible. </p>
<p data-line-id="93269eea2086424ba9623d33006dc678"> Three of these feedback loops are particularly important: </p>
<ul data-line-id="be94d1ef2fa44c6e81be01ecdf381a11"><ul><li>Immense quantities of carbon are locked up in organic matter, now frozen in arctic permafrost. Above 2°C, there is a high risk that the organic matter will thaw rapidly and decompose, releasing carbon dioxide and methane (a much more potent greenhouse gas), which would increase global warming and cause further thawing;</li><li>Ice, whether on land or the ocean, reflects the sun’s radiation. Once the ice sheets of Greenland, Antarctica, and the Arctic Ocean start to melt, the darker land and water surfaces that are exposed will absorb more of the sun’s warmth, causing more ice to melt;</li><li>The Amazon rainforest is another huge store of carbon. As temperatures rise above 2°C, the forest may begin to die, releasing its stored carbon into the atmosphere.<br/></li></ul></ul>
<p data-line-id="6229058b5e7a452ab690c6c52718e842"> When we include these and other reinforcing loops in our calculations, we cannot easily brush aside the threat climate change poses to the future of civilization. </p>
<p data-line-id="c8f19872c4164735b45d6fa645972ba5"> Gates seeks to de-emphasize the existential threat posed by climate change in order to “put human welfare at the center of our climate strategies.” But this doesn’t tell us how tolerant we should be of the risk of creating a climate that will be disastrous for human welfare for centuries to come. Tolerating 2.9°C of warming by 2100 may, in the long run, be far worse for human welfare than doing everything possible to keep warming below 2°C. </p>

But space is no longer simply about exploration and innovation. It has become a front line for security, particularly for Europe. Just days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Russian <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/cipr/items/740427/en">cyberattack</a> took down a satellite network providing critical connectivity to Europe. And now, both Russia and China are developing weapons to jam, overwhelm, and destroy Europe’s satellites. </p>

<p data-line-id="f14483dffcc04ff79c04f9ae74f492b4"> MANAGUA – When indigenous peoples are mentioned in the context of climate change, my mind immediately goes to images of my grandmother’s roofless and flooded house, destroyed by a Category 5 hurricane and a Category 4 storm in quick succession. </p><p data-line-id="0dfed58470d04095a0251fa05eedc10e"> I also move beyond the personal, thinking of the extreme weather swings in the Andes that are damaging agricultural production; the Maasai families in Kenya and Tanzania watching their livestock die from droughts or, increasingly, massive floods; and the communities devastated by landslides in the Philippines’ Cordillera mountains. </p><p data-line-id="a665d13bf8cf4ef1b5f00eb9d31a0a43"> For indigenous peoples, climate change is more than figures and charts; it is a wound that festers, eating away at our land, resources, spirituality, and culture. The extreme weather events that are growing more frequent and severe <a href="https://desapublications.un.org/publications/state-worlds-indigenous-peoples-volume-vi-climate-crisis">disproportionately harm</a> our communities because we rely directly on natural ecosystems. </p><p data-line-id="78c3dbff41b043c981d744255bea8be4"> The decision to hold this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in the Amazon region has raised our expectations significantly. To be sure, the road to Belém has not been easy. We are hopeful about the proceedings, while also approaching them with the caution and clarity that come from having taken part in climate negotiations many times before, only to be ignored. </p><p data-line-id="31f99bf184a94f2d85acca386e928666"> These summits are dominated by national policymakers. Still, we have always insisted that our voices be heard – even from the margins – and will continue to do so. Our aspiration is not only to be invited to the negotiating table and given a say in decision-making, but to help create a collective space where everyone can participate as a valued stakeholder. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="1c872c35c0a34cb0afb15fd1017eeb8f"> With <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/11/10/cop30-what-to-expect-from-this-years-un-climate-talks">more than 3,000</a> indigenous people from Africa, the Arctic, Asia, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe expected to attend COP30, the Global Caucus of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change has developed positions on the summit’s main themes. Whether discussing action on climate finance, adaptation, or mitigation, our rights to self-determination and free, prior, and informed consent concerning all matters affecting our lands, territories, and resources must be recognized. These are not favors or nice-to-haves, but the essential principles of a just climate transition. </p><p data-line-id="61b67b6c71ec4f66b873bab2ea2a31b8"> As COP30’s host, Brazil seeks to make it the “<a href="https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/pre-cop-concludes-with-progress-toward-consensus-on-implementing-agreements-and-strengthening-adaptation">COP of implementation</a>,” which means translating commitments into robust action: capacity and technology transfers, as well as finance that actually reaches those on the front lines of climate change. </p><p data-line-id="b9eb56690d2b4cdba32d86a191cf5c7a"> For indigenous peoples, implementing climate policies requires direct access to predictable and sustainable finance. Instead of being forced to depend on intermediaries who leave us with crumbs, we should be trusted to manage the funds ourselves, allocating them based on our own needs, timelines, and knowledge systems. The problem with climate finance is not a lack of capacity but a lack of trust and political will. </p><p data-line-id="ccf14f783657485081c39da4b9b48197"> Moreover, multilateralism – touted as the path to climate salvation – is often skewed in favor of wealthy countries and influential stakeholders. We need partners who treat us as such, rather than as beneficiaries, who recognize our governance structures, support our initiatives, conduct cultural due diligence, and, above all, encourage genuine dialogue. </p><p data-line-id="6db1309904ad44e68083830f0cccefee"> In debates about how to ensure a just transition, we will continue to stress that clean-energy projects must not be built at the expense of our dispossession. Without strong safeguards, the decarbonization process risks becoming yet another <a href="https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sacrifice-Zones-final-layout.pdf">cycle of extractivism</a>. Respect for indigenous peoples’ rights to land and resources must be at the heart of any climate policy. </p><p data-line-id="1575bda2cafb4a5385ecef3b968310ef"> Likewise, adaptation and mitigation must be approached holistically. We cannot continue to measure success only by carbon sequestration; we must also consider the effects of these efforts on livelihoods, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab68a9#erlab68a9s3">mental and spiritual health</a>, and the cultural continuity of indigenous peoples. </p><p data-line-id="d2e7a5ff5a024684aafb3e53bbed110e"> Governments and other institutions must be held accountable at COP30 for the promises they have made over the years. Words should become tangible commitments, particularly in regard to providing indigenous peoples with direct access to finance. This will require a decisive shift in mindset: climate action must do good, not merely avoid harm. </p><p data-line-id="62c3d94eebc44bfabcce130583d1595b"> Indigenous peoples, when viewed from this perspective, are part of the solution. Caring for the planet is embedded in our knowledge systems – restoring a forest, protecting a lagoon, and preserving traditional seeds are everyday tasks for us. But to carry out this work, we need real recognition and support from the international community. </p>

It is now unclear what lies ahead for American policy, the international aid system, or the world’s poorest. All we know is that a massive gap needs to be filled. </p>

<p data-line-id="6f66fb8fb69c42f99b3a52e818f7f0ca"> MILAN – During a recent trip to Kazakhstan, I was struck by people’s enthusiasm for AI. Virtually everyone I encountered – including academics, policymakers, and entrepreneurs – seemed convinced that the technology will help solve thorny challenges, from diversifying the economy away from dependence on natural resources to expanding access to critical services, particularly for remote populations. I had expected the diffusion of knowledge about AI to be slower, but perhaps their positivity should not have surprised me. After all, the rapid development of AI implies important opportunities for emerging economies. </p>

<p data-line-id="5035c49c696b418cbeac1a55c00add48"> LJUBLJANA – Emancipatory movements around the world rightly rejoiced at Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race. Clearly, today’s populist right has no monopoly on the ability to mobilize crowds and attract new or disillusioned voters. Democratic socialists can do it, too. </p>

<p data-line-id="790702c866b7450ea905d73d9c9c16b8"> GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.” </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="7b6f3215698f4a0eb30f2c6769efbf21"> SÃO PAULO – With the United Nations Climate Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, approaching, it is clear that the world’s widely shared commitment to a just energy transition is falling by the wayside. In the year since governments signed on to the agreement at COP29 to scale up climate finance – with a goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 – wealthy countries have been retreating from their financial pledges. Worse, these signs of bad faith are coming just as the costs of climate adaptation and decarbonization in developing countries are mounting. </p>
<p data-line-id="fc5705a95e1c465cb8fdfa9e92fc5927"> If the Global North is no longer willing to meet its funding promises, as now seems certain, it can still demonstrate good faith, nonetheless, through another form of solidarity: sharing the knowledge, technology, and intellectual property that underpin the green transition. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9624c52476b4d388d9c0a2607779146"> This is not an issue that can be deferred. The shift to a green economy is already reproducing the same asymmetries that have long defined global trade. Instead of fostering inclusive development, climate policy is increasingly being shaped by protectionist measures and IP regimes that entrench technological monopolies in the Global North. For example, the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism may be billed as a safeguard against carbon leakage; but it also illustrates how climate policy can be used to justify protectionist trade measures. </p>
<p data-line-id="1f2e87891de641b9aebd15b8d84cf63d"> Moreover, China’s recent <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/china-files-wto-complaint-against-india-over-ev-battery-subsidies-urges-new-delhi-to-rectify-wrongdoings/articleshow/124571889.cms">complaint</a> against India for its electric-vehicle and battery subsidies shows how green industrial policies are increasingly becoming grounds for trade disputes. Together, these developments signal a growing tension between climate goals and World Trade Organization rules. Could measures to address climate change soon become a new impetus for economic exclusion? </p>
<p data-line-id="93bf01789124457a821484db8d68aa0b"> At the heart of this issue lies a stark imbalance: larger powers like China, the United States, and the EU are producing high-value green technologies, while most developing countries are stuck exporting low-value green commodities – primarily critical minerals. This mirrors the colonial-era division of labor, whereby the Global South supplied raw materials, and the North supplied innovation, monopolized production, and reaped the largest profits. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="f43bc6c24e0b4c2ba6f23b66033106d0"> Data from the World Intellectual Property Organization <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_econstat_wp_44.pdf">underscore</a> the depth of this divide. Green patents (relating to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation) are overwhelmingly concentrated in a handful of countries, such as China, the US, Japan, and Germany. Between 2000 and 2024, the top ten economies accounted for nearly 90% of international patent filings in solar and wind technologies. Brazil, despite ranking sixth globally in installed wind capacity, contributed only 0.4% of global wind patents. For solar, its share was a mere 0.19%. </p>
<p data-line-id="f2f8211539cf44bcbc6b44ad4cb1fbf2"> This technological concentration is not accidental. It is the result of a global IP regime that privileges monopoly profits over public goods. Efforts to foster more global coordination, including through the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS) agreement, have failed to address the fundamental problem. </p>
<p data-line-id="b1e4bb04008646e1be5d1989d7171c9c"> Without access to affordable technologies, the Global South cannot fully participate in the climate transition. Worse, the current system risks locking developing countries into a new form of dependency, supplying the minerals for batteries and solar panels but lacking the means to produce them. </p>
<p data-line-id="6274447ec049417381b03bdedf9a4303"> Climate finance is not sufficient to break this cycle. Instead, technology transfers and reforms to the global IP regime must be at the center of climate negotiations. While the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris climate agreement do acknowledge this, little progress has been made. </p>
<p data-line-id="7fae00315285470083be566db1f4ebd8"> Fortunately, there is a precedent for the necessary changes. Back in the 2000s, Brazil played a pivotal role in categorizing access to HIV/AIDS medicines as a public good, rather than as a commodity governed solely by IP rights. This shift was driven by a combination of legal, political, and civil-society actions that challenged the global pharmaceutical patent regime and put public health first. </p>
<p data-line-id="f92fb8141ad549fbb13305c57c33e2a0"> As the Nobel laureate economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-e-stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a> has <a href="https://cgt.columbia.edu/news/stiglitz-wealth-health-intellectual-property-laws-facing-counterattack/">argued</a>, such mechanisms are essential to correct market failures and ensure equitable access to innovation. That is why the International Court of Justice, in its recent <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/187/187-20250723-pre-01-00-en.pdf">advisory opinion</a> on climate change, underscored the obligation of all states to cooperate – beyond the provision of finance – on the development and diffusion of green technologies, including by sharing knowledge and engaging in technology transfers.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3da193e1fd4c43dc88bb2d4b08cc0d5a"> The Technology Implementation Program that was agreed at COP28 offers a means to foster such cooperation. Under Brazil’s leadership at COP30, TIP can become a platform for strengthening national innovation systems, enabling countries to adapt technologies to local contexts and build capacity for climate solutions. The idea is to use a mix of public and private money to support trial projects, and then to scale those that prove effective. </p>
<p data-line-id="a2e001acf81445b5a88da182c39296eb"> For example, we could support a pilot that aims to produce low-carbon fertilizer using green hydrogen. Currently, ammonia – the key input for nitrogen fertilizers – is made using hydrogen from fossil fuels, which is why the sector is responsible for roughly <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/fertiliser-emissions-could-be-cut-to-one-fifth-of-current-levels-by-2050/">1-2% of global carbon dioxide emissions</a>. By replacing fossil-based hydrogen with renewable (green) hydrogen, the same ammonia output would produce far fewer emissions, as well as offering a scalable, locally adaptable solution. If the pilot succeeds in this hard-to-abate sector, it will create a replicable model for other countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9b63c1d0a614c9b874d378bffc672cb"> Brazil’s COP30 presidency can rally the Global South behind a vision of TIP that delivers climate justice through innovation. This is not just a technical agenda, but a political one. Only by empowering countries with access to green technologies can they build the capacity they need. And by helping the rest of the world decarbonize, wealthy countries will be helping themselves. </p>

Stocks keep hitting record highs. And Asian and Gulf countries have pledged trillions of dollars in foreign direct investment in the US during the Trump presidency. </p>

<p data-line-id="abde84e9846a46288ce1c8a167a6ff10"> BERLIN/SANTIAGO – AI is often portrayed as the harbinger of a prosperous, more efficient future. But the machines driving this revolution depend on a resource far older – and far more contested – than data or electricity: water. </p><p data-line-id="848284dd839c408fbf35a15a7211d03f"> As the Heinrich Böll Foundation’s recent <a href="https://eu.boell.org/en/WaterAtlas">Water Atlas</a> makes clear, AI’s rapid growth is depleting local water reserves around the world, from drought-stricken Chile to South Africa. Its physical footprint reflects a new form of colonial extraction; instead of silver and soy, now it is the cooling water that keeps the digital economy running. </p><p data-line-id="93706a1868494ca3b99d769fbb7ad78d"> While the debate about AI’s energy use focuses on the power needed to train and operate large language models, what is often overlooked is the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-water-usage">vast amount</a> of water required to cool data centers, not to mention the water used in energy production and hardware manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="4ad43f25c1174e8d9ec8f9062a0331c9"> ChatGPT is a prime example. Training GPT-3 required <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3724499">roughly 700,000 liters of water</a> for cooling alone. A Greenpeace study <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/publikationen/20250514-greenpeace-studie-umweltauswirkungen-ki-eng.pdf">estimates</a> that data centers will consume 664 billion liters annually by 2030, compared to 239 billion liters in 2024. </p><p data-line-id="88280c6ae108411aae31356aeec80dd7"> AI’s benefits are concentrated in the Global North, yet its environmental costs increasingly fall on the Global South. In 2023, mass protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center">erupted</a> in Uruguay over a proposed Google data center as the country suffered its worst drought in 70 years. With reservoirs running dry, authorities began pumping brackish water from the Río de la Plata estuary into public systems, <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/where-cloud-meets-cement/">granting Google permits</a> to draw from the remaining freshwater reserves even as working-class families boiled salty tap water to drink. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="81e2c009287345e4943254bf560325d0"> A similar conflict has unfolded in Chile, one of Latin America’s most drought-prone countries. In Santiago’s Cerrillos district, a proposed Google data center was projected to consume <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#chile">7.6 million liters of water per day</a> – roughly equal to the entire community’s annual use. In response, activists from the local group MOSACAT launched a legal and political campaign that forced a redesign of the cooling system and a new environmental review. </p><p data-line-id="18fff99b83a34f1e8381524749e42914"> These community struggles highlight a familiar pattern in which corporations and governments present data centers as engines of modernization while downplaying their environmental costs. In Mexico’s Querétaro region, where rural and indigenous communities already face severe water scarcity, the problems go far beyond depletion: diesel emissions from backup generators cause air and noise pollution; electronic waste imported from the Global North continues to pile up; and growing demand for land, housing, and electricity is driving up costs and straining local infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="672c998899f14568a6ea15566fb36c27"> Regulation has done little to slow this expansion or improve environmental standards. While the European Union’s 2024 <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">AI Act</a> mandates transparency on energy demand and computing power, it says nothing about water use. Even the <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, which requires data centers to report water consumption, applies only to data facilities <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/europes-thirst-for-ai-runs-into-local-water-worries/">within the EU</a>. Moreover, reporting is not the same as reform: efficiency – limited by technology and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox">Jevons paradox</a> (which occurs when greater efficiency boosts demand for a resource) – too often distracts from the deeper question of sufficiency. </p><p data-line-id="8abc775c92444977ae7e347d837a6deb"> At the same time, many developing economies compete for tech investment by offering generous tax breaks and fast-tracking environmental permits with minimal oversight. Governments tend to frame this as advancing data sovereignty, but Big Tech ultimately holds the power. Moreover, contrary to official promises, data centers create few jobs, and structural inequalities continue to impede the growth of local AI industries. For example, criticism of Brazil’s data center policy <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/brazil-is-handing-out-generous-incentives-for-data-centers-but-what-it-stands-to-gain-from-it-is-still-unclear/">highlights</a> its focus on attracting large tech firms, while neglecting fair competition for domestic companies. </p><p data-line-id="2fe603369b514eb68828c6bda251248a"> Environmental impact assessments are another weak link. Studies <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#ekurhuleni">show</a> they are frequently incomplete, inaccurate, or hidden from public scrutiny. In Chile, regulators approved Google’s project despite unresolved issues concerning groundwater rights. In Mexico, activists spent months fighting for access to water-use documents. And in South Africa and Brazil, companies often negotiate directly with national ministries, bypassing local authorities altogether. </p><p data-line-id="85719541c82b4595b32ad8bb310a4a19"> All of this raises a critical question: Who gets a say when digital growth depends on local water sources? Like its benefits, the risks of AI are unequally distributed. For many Latin American and African communities, opposition to data centers is not a rejection of progress but an effort to redefine it. Their defense of water reserves challenges the fantasy of infinite digital expansion in a world of finite resources. </p><p data-line-id="1a7dec09f17d4f64bc1367deb69c41a8"> The problem isn’t one of innovation but of distribution. Sustainable cooling systems that use recycled water, saline water, and rainwater already exist, and air-based systems and heat recovery can further reduce freshwater use. But companies have little incentive to adopt these alternatives when water is cheap, unregulated, and invisible on balance sheets. Another, deeper problem lies in AI’s very nature: its intensive computing demands ever-greater water consumption. </p><p data-line-id="42a520c220774e0fb03b6c39d438921b"> Addressing these challenges requires reconciling technological ambition with the realities of today’s escalating climate and ecological crises. Otherwise, AI’s unchecked growth risks turning water-stressed regions into <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sacrifice-zones">sacrifice zones</a>. </p><p data-line-id="fbc94be9424d40caae1b74ec2aaffa8e"> This task – shaping a humane and sustainable technological future – is not one that individuals and communities can accomplish on their own. Political leaders must take urgent steps to democratize decision-making, ensure accountability, and align technological innovation with planetary boundaries. </p>
