    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="bb323ca075da46dbb6099d92edc4088e"> NEW YORK – The United States is winning. Or at least that is how it looks if you’re tracking market indices and the parade of countries lining up to cut deals with President Donald Trump. The US economy is outpacing its allies. Stocks keep hitting record highs. And Asian and Gulf countries have pledged trillions of dollars in foreign direct investment in the US during the Trump presidency. </p>
<p data-line-id="f24d9a56ffd14f0090a689b2d511ea57"> Moreover, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and several Southeast Asian countries have offered non-reciprocal trade deals. Canada withdrew its plan to impose a digital services tax. Japan made unilateral concessions on automotive tariffs and Nippon Steel. And European pharmaceutical companies are relocating production to the US to avoid punitive tariffs. While the labor market is softening and consumer confidence is in the doldrums, spending (especially by the wealthiest Americans) continues to chug along. Combined with an AI investment boom and massive deficit spending – enabled by the dollar’s ongoing status as the global reserve currency – markets continue to bet on US liquidity and growth. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0b400ce9e3440b28da7ffda4c7ec9f2"> But while the short-term picture looks strong, the US is trading long-term strategic advantages for immediate tactical gains, and the costs are accumulating in ways that won’t become apparent until it’s too late to reverse course. </p>
<p data-line-id="c20e7c24e0b64d81a1887d5014c46737"> Start with immigration. For decades, America’s ability to attract the best and brightest from around the world has been the cornerstone of its technological, economic, and soft-power dominance. But now, the welcome mat is being rolled up. The Trump administration is increasingly hostile to immigrants (whether legal or illegal, skilled or unskilled), nativist sentiment among Americans is growing, and civil liberties (especially for non-white immigrants) are increasingly uncertain. The numbers speak for themselves: International student arrivals to the US have declined by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/06/upshot/us-international-student-travel.html">nearly 20%</a> relative to last year. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="838f6337ebf64896949a5e2e5ccdd77c"> Meanwhile, China is introducing new visas explicitly designed to poach high-skilled workers from the US, and Canada is plastering airports with recruitment pitches. As America becomes a less attractive destination for top global talent relative to its competitors, the long-term economic damage will compound. </p>
<p data-line-id="a107b6835c134b2e9ab1e8cf08ca4ea9"> Then there are the universities. The Trump administration has not only targeted humanities departments, which have indeed often become intellectually insular and ideologically doctrinaire, but has also slashed research infrastructure at America’s (and the world’s) finest universities. These institutions keep America at the cutting edge of science and technology and attract tomorrow’s leading scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Undermining that ecosystem will erode a key pillar of the US economy at a time when public trust in science itself is declining. Vaccine skepticism, conspiracy theories, and reflexive rejection of expertise are not just cultural quirks. They are structural disadvantages when competing against countries where faith in science and technology remains strong, leaving Americans in no position to drive the next wave of innovation. </p>
<p data-line-id="7de318df3761440181ee09c2fe0b493e"> Take AI. The US is racing ahead in consumer-facing AI – chatbots, engagement-maximizing social media, tools to produce yet more addictive slop, ever-larger language models that claim to be one step closer to superintelligence – because that is where the money is. But these technologies are also fragmenting society, amplifying misinformation, and possibly contributing to a kind of collective psychosis. China, by contrast, has channeled AI development away from consumer applications in favor of defense and industrial uses, which carry less risk of social fragmentation and more strategic upside.  </p>
<p data-line-id="f25e33b2728c4a6894f735f225a0482a"> The energy story is similar. On one hand, the US has become the world’s most powerful petrostate, which is not inherently a problem, considering that fossil fuels will continue to power data centers, agriculture, and heavy industry for decades to come. But the US has effectively ceded leadership on post-carbon energy to China, which already dominates battery technology, solar power, next-generation nuclear, and critical-mineral supply chains. The US is doubling down on the energy of the past at the expense of the energy of the future. </p>
<p data-line-id="5de66fadd2a64518bfacab3b8d0e2044"> Or consider trade policy. The Trump administration is imposing the highest US tariffs in a century, resulting in roughly a <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-august-7-2025">17%</a> regressive tax on American businesses and consumers, which are forced to pay more for intermediate inputs and final goods. Paired with a sharp turn toward industrial policy and state capitalism, the US is moving away from the free-market principles that made its economy so competitive in the first place. While targeted government intervention in select sectors (semiconductors, banking) can sometimes be justified on specific grounds (national security, financial stability), broad protectionism and state direction tend to make economies less, not more, dynamic over time. </p>
<p data-line-id="738357cd54444181b07662190e974e7c"> This short-term thinking extends to geopolitics. Most countries are prepared to give Trump wins (some pyrrhic, some significant) to avoid open conflict. But the same countries are also working to ensure that they never find themselves in this position again. The EU has finalized trade agreements with Mercosur, Mexico, and Indonesia. Brazil is deepening economic ties with Europe, China, and Canada. India is working to stabilize relations with China while accelerating infrastructure projects that reduce its dependence on US markets. And Saudi Arabia has signed a nuclear deal with Pakistan to hedge against future security neglect from Washington. </p>
<p data-line-id="b52e88b686f14a9ba7e99a186fe005a9"> Having learned the hard way that US policy can change course every election cycle, these countries are pursuing alternatives now while accommodating America in the short run. And because these hedges require huge amounts of political capital, years of investment, and a new institutional architecture, they will be hard to reverse once built. </p>
<p data-line-id="f0af23ab954d4efeaa6e68a4db8b1310"> The US will continue outperforming allies and adversaries for the foreseeable future. Its lead is too large to be erased overnight, and in AI, it’s one of only two games in town and still preferred over China by much of the world. But the longer-term trajectory is troubling. America’s historical advantages over its peers – physical and institutional infrastructure, superior demographics driven partly by immigration, public tolerance for inequality underpinned by the perception of meritocracy, greater capacity for deficit spending – are all heading in the wrong direction. Despite being in a weaker overall position, China, which is known to take the long view, is doing what it can to exploit these shifts. </p>
<p data-line-id="32b5bbd82a104e8980d5054c9491324e"> Perhaps most worryingly, everyone in a deeply divided America seems to agree that the country’s biggest threat is domestic. They disagree only about where that threat lies. As a result, national politics will remain focused on internecine battles, rather than on making the deeper, patient investments – in people, institutions, research, and infrastructure – that long-term competitiveness requires. America’s short-term wins are real, but at some point, the bill will have to be paid. </p>

<p data-line-id="c537cbfb8ca049c08b85dea041f8290d"> CAPE TOWN – A growing chorus of Western media outlets, think tanks, and financial commentators is questioning whether Africa’s multilateral financial institutions, such as the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), should retain “preferred creditor status.” Not only are their criticisms misguided; they threaten to erode Africa’s growing financial autonomy and undermine its ability to chart an independent economic course. </p>

<p data-line-id="abde84e9846a46288ce1c8a167a6ff10"> BERLIN/SANTIAGO – AI is often portrayed as the harbinger of a prosperous, more efficient future. But the machines driving this revolution depend on a resource far older – and far more contested – than data or electricity: water. </p><p data-line-id="848284dd839c408fbf35a15a7211d03f"> As the Heinrich Böll Foundation’s recent <a href="https://eu.boell.org/en/WaterAtlas">Water Atlas</a> makes clear, AI’s rapid growth is depleting local water reserves around the world, from drought-stricken Chile to South Africa. Its physical footprint reflects a new form of colonial extraction; instead of silver and soy, now it is the cooling water that keeps the digital economy running. </p><p data-line-id="93706a1868494ca3b99d769fbb7ad78d"> While the debate about AI’s energy use focuses on the power needed to train and operate large language models, what is often overlooked is the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-water-usage">vast amount</a> of water required to cool data centers, not to mention the water used in energy production and hardware manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="4ad43f25c1174e8d9ec8f9062a0331c9"> ChatGPT is a prime example. Training GPT-3 required <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3724499">roughly 700,000 liters of water</a> for cooling alone. A Greenpeace study <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/publikationen/20250514-greenpeace-studie-umweltauswirkungen-ki-eng.pdf">estimates</a> that data centers will consume 664 billion liters annually by 2030, compared to 239 billion liters in 2024. </p><p data-line-id="88280c6ae108411aae31356aeec80dd7"> AI’s benefits are concentrated in the Global North, yet its environmental costs increasingly fall on the Global South. In 2023, mass protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center">erupted</a> in Uruguay over a proposed Google data center as the country suffered its worst drought in 70 years. With reservoirs running dry, authorities began pumping brackish water from the Río de la Plata estuary into public systems, <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/where-cloud-meets-cement/">granting Google permits</a> to draw from the remaining freshwater reserves even as working-class families boiled salty tap water to drink. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="81e2c009287345e4943254bf560325d0"> A similar conflict has unfolded in Chile, one of Latin America’s most drought-prone countries. In Santiago’s Cerrillos district, a proposed Google data center was projected to consume <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#chile">7.6 million liters of water per day</a> – roughly equal to the entire community’s annual use. In response, activists from the local group MOSACAT launched a legal and political campaign that forced a redesign of the cooling system and a new environmental review. </p><p data-line-id="18fff99b83a34f1e8381524749e42914"> These community struggles highlight a familiar pattern in which corporations and governments present data centers as engines of modernization while downplaying their environmental costs. In Mexico’s Querétaro region, where rural and indigenous communities already face severe water scarcity, the problems go far beyond depletion: diesel emissions from backup generators cause air and noise pollution; electronic waste imported from the Global North continues to pile up; and growing demand for land, housing, and electricity is driving up costs and straining local infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="672c998899f14568a6ea15566fb36c27"> Regulation has done little to slow this expansion or improve environmental standards. While the European Union’s 2024 <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">AI Act</a> mandates transparency on energy demand and computing power, it says nothing about water use. Even the <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, which requires data centers to report water consumption, applies only to data facilities <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/europes-thirst-for-ai-runs-into-local-water-worries/">within the EU</a>. Moreover, reporting is not the same as reform: efficiency – limited by technology and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox">Jevons paradox</a> (which occurs when greater efficiency boosts demand for a resource) – too often distracts from the deeper question of sufficiency. </p><p data-line-id="8abc775c92444977ae7e347d837a6deb"> At the same time, many developing economies compete for tech investment by offering generous tax breaks and fast-tracking environmental permits with minimal oversight. Governments tend to frame this as advancing data sovereignty, but Big Tech ultimately holds the power. Moreover, contrary to official promises, data centers create few jobs, and structural inequalities continue to impede the growth of local AI industries. For example, criticism of Brazil’s data center policy <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/brazil-is-handing-out-generous-incentives-for-data-centers-but-what-it-stands-to-gain-from-it-is-still-unclear/">highlights</a> its focus on attracting large tech firms, while neglecting fair competition for domestic companies. </p><p data-line-id="2fe603369b514eb68828c6bda251248a"> Environmental impact assessments are another weak link. Studies <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#ekurhuleni">show</a> they are frequently incomplete, inaccurate, or hidden from public scrutiny. In Chile, regulators approved Google’s project despite unresolved issues concerning groundwater rights. In Mexico, activists spent months fighting for access to water-use documents. And in South Africa and Brazil, companies often negotiate directly with national ministries, bypassing local authorities altogether. </p><p data-line-id="85719541c82b4595b32ad8bb310a4a19"> All of this raises a critical question: Who gets a say when digital growth depends on local water sources? Like its benefits, the risks of AI are unequally distributed. For many Latin American and African communities, opposition to data centers is not a rejection of progress but an effort to redefine it. Their defense of water reserves challenges the fantasy of infinite digital expansion in a world of finite resources. </p><p data-line-id="1a7dec09f17d4f64bc1367deb69c41a8"> The problem isn’t one of innovation but of distribution. Sustainable cooling systems that use recycled water, saline water, and rainwater already exist, and air-based systems and heat recovery can further reduce freshwater use. But companies have little incentive to adopt these alternatives when water is cheap, unregulated, and invisible on balance sheets. Another, deeper problem lies in AI’s very nature: its intensive computing demands ever-greater water consumption. </p><p data-line-id="42a520c220774e0fb03b6c39d438921b"> Addressing these challenges requires reconciling technological ambition with the realities of today’s escalating climate and ecological crises. Otherwise, AI’s unchecked growth risks turning water-stressed regions into <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sacrifice-zones">sacrifice zones</a>. </p><p data-line-id="fbc94be9424d40caae1b74ec2aaffa8e"> This task – shaping a humane and sustainable technological future – is not one that individuals and communities can accomplish on their own. Political leaders must take urgent steps to democratize decision-making, ensure accountability, and align technological innovation with planetary boundaries. </p>

<p data-line-id="da03fb628d9e424b99c90ce9b13b72b9"> PROVIDENCE/CHARLOTTESVILLE – News media tend to focus on the world’s major powers, because they command more resources by dint of their relatively larger economies, militaries, and energy endowments. But there are costs to such dominance. For example, a single American Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier costs $13 billion, while the F-35 fighter jet costs around $100 million. So, if you can build your military equipment for less than your opponent, you can gain a strategic advantage. </p>

<p data-line-id="e7ab1803d50647a685bdd366cc4d195b"> NEW DELHI – Efforts to mitigate climate change have largely focused on the shift away from fossil fuels in energy production. As a result, most climate-finance assessments have studied the costs of such a transition and determined that large investments are required to deploy cleaner sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="091cd489d9c641a2abe24517e966d170"> But in a new <a href="https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Finance-Needs-of-Nine-G20-EMEs.pdf">working paper</a>, we found that shifting the energy sector to renewables is relatively affordable for emerging-market economies (EMEs) in the G20. Our study measures the climate-finance needs from 2022 to 2030 of Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power, road transport, cement, and steel sectors, which account for about half of such emissions in these nine EMEs. </p>
<p data-line-id="004fb6b43fef47a0be50a35015e29f63"> For starters, we found that the clean-energy transition is advancing at a steady pace. The power sector accounts for about 27% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in these nine EMEs, which together account for 44% of global power-sector emissions. To meet increasing energy demand and climate targets, these economies have focused on incrementally phasing out the use of fossil fuels in power generation and replacing them with renewables. Between 2023 and 2030, the share of clean energy in their total installed capacity is projected to rise from 54% to 65%, while their total installed capacity of renewables should almost double, from 2,150 gigawatts to 4,220 gigawatts. </p>
<p data-line-id="8e2568bc3e1f4cb0a65e246b81c31bbf"> The largest shifts during this period are expected in India and South Africa, where the share of renewables is set to rise from 45% to 63% and from 25% to 42%, respectively. China is also making significant advances, with its share of renewables projected to increase from 55% to 65%. In seven of these EMEs (excluding Indonesia and South Africa), more than half of the total installed power capacity will come from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="31264edcaeec4adfb1bcec3348a2db74"> This is possible because rapid technological developments and China’s massive push into green manufacturing have dramatically lowered the cost of establishing solar and wind farms in recent years. Globally, the cost of installed solar PV and onshore wind <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osgttinf2024d3_en.pdf">decreased</a> by 83% and 42%, respectively, between 2010 and 2022.  </p>
<p data-line-id="97e2f7b3b5cc4dc09fd38dbc8dd3024c"> In addition, the cost of batteries has also <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-can-innovation-help-secure-future-battery-markets-and-mineral-supplies">fallen</a> – by about 90% between 2010 and 2023 – driven by innovation and lower raw-material costs. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity projects are also more affordable now, especially in China and India, owing to favorable topographic conditions, low labor and material costs, and relatively streamlined regulatory and permitting processes. </p>
<p data-line-id="dfe57aa9176344488faebc348e1952de"> Given the falling costs of renewable energy, the G20’s EMEs will need only $121 billion in climate finance for power generation – the amount over and above the investment required in a business-as-usual scenario – between 2024 and 2030. According to our estimates, capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power plants will decline by $156 billion over that period, while spending for clean power will increase by $277 billion. Most notably, India and China will save $43 billion and $52 billion, respectively, on capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power sources but will need to increase such spending on renewables by $90 billion and $102 billion, respectively. </p>
<p data-line-id="d2aaa18b4d444bb19b6b5abe891661f9"> Storage costs (both battery and pumped storage) for renewables will likely entail additional capital expenditure of $28 billion for these EMEs, bringing the overall climate finance needed for 2024-30 to $149 billion, or $21 billion annually. Excluding China, the remaining eight EMEs will require $94 billion, or $13 billion annually, in cumulative climate finance (including storage costs) to shift to renewable sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="93a15039527c4fcf89b6c8f174dbbc18"> These estimates do not account for the additional costs of adapting electricity grids to cleaner energy sources. Large-scale growth in AI and data centers may also increase energy demand more than envisaged. </p>
<p data-line-id="810deb1c59b84f4eb663923b9ffc0d35"> Of the nine EMEs we studied, India is projected to need the largest amount of climate finance – $57 billion, or 38% of the total estimate – to continue decarbonizing the power sector, while China will require slightly less, around $55 billion, because the increase in renewables’ share of installed capacity is expected to be more pronounced in India than in China. Climate finance as a percentage of GDP will likely be largest in South Africa, at 0.25%, followed by India (0.13%) and Mexico (0.09%). </p>
<p data-line-id="5ac7267a17a14c95bf81571b9a355ce0"> A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that financing the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, in the intervening years, the cost of renewables has fallen dramatically. Compared to road transport, cement, and steel in the nine EMEs we studied, the power sector will require the least amount of climate finance for the foreseeable future, even after accounting for storage costs and low renewable load factors. Now that decarbonizing the energy system is much more affordable in EMEs, there is no excuse not to do so. </p>

<p data-line-id="b3fbdc63119c4b7fad15bc8c57ab8374"> BRUSSELS – In a face-to-face meeting last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reached a truce in their countries’ long-running trade war. Trump lowered tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for the rollback of Chinese export controls on rare earths.

But a closer look at the numbers suggests that China is not the rare-earth juggernaut it might seem to be. </p>

Just ask residents of Spain and Portugal, who were suddenly faced with a total blackout last April, when a series of cascading voltage surges <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7d4vjdlrmo">shut down</a> their electricity grids. Both Spain and Portugal are now pursuing massive investments in strengthening their grids’ resilience. But citizens should not have to wait until after disaster strikes for their leaders to commit to investing in critical infrastructure, which nowadays includes cloud services. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfc5e73178c34b13b0d7379aa178fc2f"> CHICAGO – In a recent <em>Financial </em><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f6be08a-fd24-4558-b373-6ada31e18900" target="_blank">commentary</a></span>, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins argued that, “the SEC should only require companies to supply information under the objective standard of whether a reasonable investor would regard it as important to an investment decision. Rules written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment fail this test – and fail investors.” </p><p data-line-id="981256e5a26845ebb0f2b5d92bfc65f8"> At face value, Atkins’ statement seems unexceptional. But it leaves open a key question: What is material to a firm’s financial performance? Atkins suggests that disclosure should not be driven by “political fads or distorted objectives,” citing the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which expands and standardizes corporate sustainability reporting to improve transparency and comparability of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information. Such disclosures, he argues, “may be socially significant but are not generally financially material.”  </p><p data-line-id="fd2eddf66f2e4ae6b2672ffe904754c1"> But this sounds like wishful thinking. If European regulators think the environment matters and they act on that belief, that materially affects multinational firms’ costs of doing business in Europe. Just last month, a Paris <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f3e072e-d136-4174-ad74-d5bbc14e8a99">court</a> found TotalEnergies had engaged in “misleading commercial practices” by claiming it was “a major actor in the energy transition.” Citing EU legislation that requires green claims to be supported by “objective, publicly available, and verifiable commitments and targets,” the court found the company’s climate pronouncements to be inconsistent with its expanded investments in hydrocarbons. While the fines Total has incurred are small, such fines are likely to be larger in the future – and thus material to investors. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="7282690d004044cc9e4bd8131856e1d2"> Obviously, US regulators today put little weight on companies’ green strategies or the need to disclose them. But if regulators elsewhere care more, such strategies are still material to firms that do business across borders. And since there is a deep divide in the United States between Democrats and Republicans on the merits of ESG policies, a company that avoids ESG-related actions during the current administration might find itself hamstrung in a future one. Shouldn’t investors who value long-run earnings be able to make their own judgments about these issues? Regardless of whether ESG is a political fad (or whether opposition to it is), disclosures of ESG-aligned practices may still be material to the bottom line. </p><p data-line-id="593b688c3d4142ec97f0b630b482b93c"> Nor are regulators the only ones who might care. In the TotalEnergies case, the concern was that customers will be misled by the company’s environmental pronouncements. In a warming world, it is reasonable to expect that some people’s purchasing decisions might well be swayed by a company’s environmental practices.  </p><p data-line-id="88fb40cfaa354cd0b734ba66a975eeac"> Moreover, research <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bbr/a/THJmk5T7WKCKTJgXvT8NnQt">suggests</a> that Brazilian firms with better environmental practices (when certified by regulators) attract more skilled workers and ultimately perform better. Thus, whether environmental practices command universal political appeal is beside the point. If they attract a preferred kind of worker and enhance a firm’s bottom line, the company’s shareholders would want to know about it. </p><p data-line-id="a408f572609444aeb7bc245fca049710"> Atkins does raise a potentially valid concern about the intended audience for corporate disclosures. He opposes rules “written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment.” But, again, what if some shareholders are willing to sacrifice returns for socially beneficial practices? Should their preferences be ignored?  </p><p data-line-id="91fb1d0b89804e89a7f0f95e6a4ff7e8"> The argument for focusing solely on financial returns has always been that, by doing so, the firm empowers minority investors to go and spend their enhanced share of wealth on whatever social or political cause they prefer. The company does not need to cater to their whims to empower them. Yet Oliver Hart of Harvard and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luigi-zingales">Luigi Zingales</a> of the University of Chicago make a <a href="https://hart.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/companies-should-maximize-shareholder-welfare-not-market-value">compelling argument</a> that shareholders may prefer that the company act directly on their concerns. The shareholder-value argument suggests that a firm should continue to pollute the environment to maximize profits and its share price, because its environmentally conscious shareholders can then use some of their enhanced wealth to fund a clean-up. But the problem with this view should be obvious: Environmental remediation tends to be much more costly than preventing pollution in the first place, so shareholders and society alike would be better off if the firm sacrificed some profits to follow cleaner practices. </p><p data-line-id="b3c15f1081734448881a0cbc8dd8e687"> Put differently, the SEC cannot simply dismiss socially motivated investors as a nuisance, because this cohort may form the majority in some firms, and their interests may not be served if the firm simply maximizes profits. In a world where investors are inundated with information, the SEC is right to ask what is and is not material. Mandatory SEC disclosures are valuable insofar as the information is more reliable than anything that is voluntarily disclosed. Since disclosure does impose a burden on firms, it should be mandated judiciously.  </p><p data-line-id="36dcc4f6e94a4239b6bfaa2bc60f4ccf"> But the SEC must recognize that a wide variety of interests look at such disclosures, and that their effects are material. To dismiss these concerns as political is to engage in politicization oneself. It is better to recognize that there are many channels through which disclosure can affect investors and society, and then make the necessary tradeoffs in SEC mandates. </p>

<p data-line-id="3dd3917fa757457eb435f061c4db58f6"> BEIJING – According to US President Donald Trump, his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping – the first of his second term – was “amazing.” Trump may have campaigned on the promise of squeezing America’s biggest geopolitical competitor, but that is not what has happened. Instead, top Chinese academics and retired military leaders whom I spoke to in Beijing this week all agree that Xi’s international strategy has been vindicated, and that an increasingly fractured multipolar world is working very much to China’s advantage. </p>

With a significant amount of foreign debt coming due next year, the conventional wisdom was that an exchange-rate-based stabilization program – letting the currency depreciate by less than the inflation rate to push inflation down – had led to a massively overvalued currency and an external deficit that was bound to precipitate a crisis. But having written a <a href="https://www.piie.com/bookstore/bailouts-or-bail-ins-responding-financial-crises-emerging-economies">book</a> on currency crises in emerging markets, and having followed Argentine policies closely, I thought this consensus was far off the mark.  </p>

<p data-line-id="f42024df344943ea9dd5f4cae8f4c4c0"> JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR – For decades, integration into the global trading system has been vital to economic growth and development. Now, however, integration implies vulnerability, as powerful actors – beginning with the United States – wield tariffs, export restrictions, and financial sanctions. For Southeast Asia, this turn of events represents both a warning and a call to action: countries must work together to shape their own destiny – or others will decide their fate for them. </p>

<p data-line-id="e330e3f2b09b45f0be2ccd549926c8c4"> DHAKA – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30) comes at a decisive moment, not just for the climate agenda but for international cooperation more broadly. Following last year’s “finance COP” in Baku – where countries agreed to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop29-un-climate-conference-agrees-to-triple-finance-to-developing-countries-protecting-lives-and">triple</a> the global target for climate finance – this year’s gathering is being framed as the “implementation COP.” </p><p data-line-id="f37e51257a9c4571b316868bf05bdcd3"> After years of negotiations, the time for ambitious commitments has passed. We now need concrete action. That means actually mobilizing climate finance, not as an act of charity, but as a strategic investment in global resilience, shared prosperity, and mutual security. </p><p data-line-id="68972c57aa1f4a5ea8080ac27bb8c96c"> Developing countries are not coming to the table empty-handed. We are bringing ambitious climate plans, national commitments, and domestic financing of our own. Bangladesh, for example, draws 75% of its climate finance from its own resources, and allocates 6-7% of its annual budget to climate-related efforts. </p><p data-line-id="6c5918510ac743f5a8d049791b30a022"> Many developing countries are also submitting updated Nationally Determined Contributions (the Paris climate agreement’s term for emissions-reduction plans), strengthening their policy frameworks, and pioneering locally driven solutions that can inform global best practices. Thus, Bangladesh recently submitted its “NDC 3.0,” which sets an unconditional emissions-reduction target of 6.39% by 2035 (in the business-as-usual scenario), and a conditional target of 13.92%. </p><p data-line-id="555cb46b72d84ed7afe7e4fcfccbb479"> But the total investment required to implement our NDC is a staggering $116 billion. That is why we have also created the Bangladesh Climate and Development Platform (BCDP), a nationally owned mechanism designed to scale up climate finance and integrate national climate strategies. With strong political support, the BCDP brings together more than ten ministries, marking a significant milestone in coordinated, country-led climate action. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9b50a3449c3f4c2ba828670dbdc847cc"> As a coastal country, Bangladesh is home to some of the world’s most fragile ecosystems, including the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the world’s largest river delta. These ecosystems provide essential services such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and disaster-risk reduction. Protecting them is vital not only for Bangladesh, but for the planet. Doing so, however, requires international support. </p><p data-line-id="d83849951dbe4e62a7585395c08d378c"> The same message applies across the Global South. While developing countries are stepping up, their plans require external support. The COP29 commitment to mobilize $300 billion per year in international climate finance, starting next year, must be the baseline. This figure still represents only a small fraction of what is needed, and we still need to ensure that financing is managed with a higher level of accountability. Developed countries must be held to their commitments, so that new funding is truly additional, rather than being repurposed from existing development aid. </p><p data-line-id="b350c2724a884f28b87ed23a37ede956"> Another priority concerns the quality of financing, which must be well structured, accessible, and effective. That means clarifying how much each developed country will contribute; how resources will be balanced between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage; and how delivery will be made predictable and fair. </p><p data-line-id="a2a536755c154e898bf2cb7028382e15"> Loans that push developing countries further into debt are not sustainable. A much larger share of finance must come in the form of grants and highly concessional flows. The world cannot build climate resilience on the back of fiscal instability. This was already a recurring theme in Baku, and now COP30 gives us a chance to translate it into a clear policy framework. </p><p data-line-id="cef703dacdaa485bb50c1aa2b1db997a"> Climate finance is sound economics, representing opportunity, not just obligation. Studies <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-adaptation-investment-case">show</a> that every $1 invested in adaptation can generate more than $10 in long-term benefits. For developed countries, supporting adaptation and resilience abroad helps stabilize supply chains, reduce disaster risks, and prevent future crises that will spill over borders. </p><p data-line-id="d7e35d48c3064f418714baf3a28e9bd2"> At the same time, developing countries hold vast, often untapped, potential to drive the global energy transition, safeguard food systems, and power sustainable growth. Bangladesh, for example, is the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2025/06/09/reinventing-rice-as-countries-cultivate-change">third-largest</a> rice producer. Helping us achieve resilience against climate shocks is critical for domestic and global food security. We also contribute to global value chains through seafood, textiles, and a dynamic, skilled workforce. With young people comprising <a href="http://thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/youths-account-28pc-population-3293161">28%</a> of our population, we have the potential to be a key partner in many growth industries of the future. </p><p data-line-id="a4ea33f39bc34ad3a9a35938c7e19b62"> As an investment in our shared future, climate finance requires partnerships that will benefit everyone – economically, socially, and environmentally. But merely increasing our financing targets is not enough. Last year, developing countries engaged in good faith to reach an agreement on climate finance, even though the outcome did not fully reflect our needs. That commitment to dialogue must now be matched by a commitment to clarity and delivery. We need all countries to engage constructively in shaping the structure of climate finance. The question is not just how much, but how it flows, and how it can best be used to drive long-term transformations. </p><p data-line-id="e29b52fa264040219ef39c207cb165f7"> Already, Brazil and Azerbaijan are co-leading efforts to build a roadmap to scale climate finance to <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t">$1.3 trillion</a> annually by 2035. But we cannot reach that goal without laying the foundation for it. That means delivering the promised $300 billion per year through mechanisms that are transparent, fair, and effective. </p><p data-line-id="b371b9ba379d48fbadd047ce34f5bb72"> With multilateralism in crisis, we must restore faith in the process. Multilateralism has delivered before, and it can do so again. COP30 is where we can prove that the international system is capable of moving from commitment to implementation, and from division to cooperation. We have the tools, and we have the knowledge. What we need now is the will to turn climate finance into a shared engine for growth, security, and a fairer future. </p>

The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty – including independent India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra – is bound up with the history of India’s struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright. This idea has penetrated Indian politics across every party, in every region, and at every level. </p>

The more we swallow these lies now, the harder it will be to question future falsehoods, because that would challenge our view of ourselves as intelligent beings. </p>

<p data-line-id="74b62ca2bc2042679745c9efda1785fb"> BEIJING – Traditional donors have sharply scaled back their aid commitments to developing countries over the past year. Some, like the United States, have virtually eliminated their aid programs. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), official development assistance (ODA) from member countries <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/04/official-development-assistance-2024-figures.html">declined by 7.1%</a> in 2024, its first annual drop in six years. </p><p data-line-id="db16ef9778d541498df6d7f1b438603b"> This trend was not limited to a few major donors. Of the 33 members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 22 slashed their aid budgets, and only four countries met the United Nations’ target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA. </p><p data-line-id="7f360c9899044473881a52a34e9a1261"> The outlook for the coming year offers little hope for improvement, as major DAC donors have announced additional cuts. Most notably, US President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended most foreign aid and dismantled the Agency for International Development (USAID), which dispersed most US government aid dollars.  </p><p data-line-id="67f10eb20fdd480d99dce191574b0874"> Meanwhile, the United Kingdom plans to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o">reduce aid spending</a> from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027. Similar retrenchment across Europe and North America is reshaping international assistance, disrupting humanitarian and climate-related programs, and creating financing gaps in critical sectors such as health, education, and clean energy. </p><p data-line-id="9f5025fc6e774589897c6b4d8107b56c"> In our 2017 book <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/going-beyond-aid/B48F59C6D8D2790D403A1A0C44B37612"><em>Going Beyond Aid</em></a>, we urged developing-country governments to reduce their dependence on foreign aid, not only because it was becoming an unreliable source of funding, but also because other, better ways of financing development were becoming more available. That message is more urgent than ever.  </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="f2fbc8217dd44edbaa41c6a024eb3cb9"> As reliance on aid becomes untenable, the international community must mobilize a broader array of financing sources to advance green and sustainable growth. This includes national development banks, industrial investment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investment in public markets, as well as innovative mechanisms such as debt swaps and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These tools can unlock domestic resources, attract long-term investors, and create synergies between public goals and private capital. </p><p data-line-id="085080d643d242608c20fff83e8cb509"> Equity investment offers a promising avenue for engaging non-traditional development partners while reducing developing countries’ dependence on debt. Government investment funds, public and private financial institutions, and other private actors can participate by taking equity stakes in public enterprises, financing infrastructure projects, or joining PPPs. Such participation not only alleviates debt burdens but also improves the performance and management of public assets.  </p><p data-line-id="77eaaf7f82c14059aa1f5fd1bd351d40"> As government-funded, mission-driven institutions, public development banks (PDBs) have the potential to provide patient capital for green and sustainable investment in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). Building on the <a href="http://www.dfidatabase.pku.edu.cn/index.htm">pioneering database</a> of public development and financial institutions created by the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, future research can identify effective ways to harness these institutions to fuel low-carbon growth. </p><p data-line-id="2f5328d4c82f4a5f8af27c762a6e45a3"> Responding to growing demand from the economies of the Global South, development partners have increasingly adopted an “entire value chain” approach to the green transition in recent years. This strategy facilitates transfers of low-carbon technologies, diffusion of digital innovations (including trade in services), and industrial modernization, enabling countries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to accelerate their shift toward sustainable development. </p><p data-line-id="a2d0b991d4534f9f96805570ae26520b"> Empirical research supports this approach. An analysis covering 139 countries <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">finds</a> that, following policy directives to incorporate green and low-carbon principles into the BRI, carbon intensity (CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions per unit of GDP) among participating countries declined significantly between 2013 and 2022. These findings are consistent with another <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">recent study</a> showing how China’s solar-energy expansion has helped transform Africa’s power sector. </p><p data-line-id="7e2beb6224ab49b89b05e589fe3cc988"> Investment in infrastructure and industrial development can also generate positive spillover effects. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.70023">shows</a> that the presence of at least one Chinese-financed infrastructure project in a second-order administrative region (comparable to a municipality) is associated with a 5% increase in nighttime luminosity – a widely used proxy for economic activity. Neighboring regions experienced a 10-15% rise in luminosity, indicating that the benefits of such projects extend well beyond the immediate investment site. <br/></p><figure data-line-id="b5f95dd16ef944eb98909a174d97b475"><img data-image="8wr68ph8q7uf" src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/3269ab77d3d209c71e81f97eafb2c31e.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="ff5f8242138c4bda9efed2524f80b643"> These outcomes underscore the critical role of infrastructure investment, particularly in energy and transportation projects. By improving electricity access, affordability, and connectivity, they reduce energy poverty, bolster public services, and stimulate economic activity in underserved areas. </p><p data-line-id="a9eaa69bb62540a6884597c0535298b0"> To meet the evolving challenges of development finance, both traditional and non-traditional donors and creditors should move beyond aid and adopt multidimensional strategies that combine trade, investment, infrastructure, green technology, and digital connectivity, including fintech solutions, to support EMDEs. Importantly, such collaborations should be viewed as a mutual learning process in which partners assume complementary roles and shared responsibilities. </p><p data-line-id="6aa7a3e6b02243cd8146cc264d97fcf2"> To be sure, there have been missteps along the way. China’s financing of coal-fired power plants before 2021, for example, had slowed reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions. But these outcomes, once recognized as policy errors, can help strengthen accountability and foster self-correcting mechanisms within the international development ecosystem. Through ongoing learning and adaptation, global partners can build a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable framework for development finance.  </p>

<p data-line-id="9a2b1e0afa33424396e9285d9cac3321">The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.</p>
