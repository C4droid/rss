<p data-line-id="4caba402b0b54bfb8d1dec0391743b73"> NEW YORK – Heading into Argentina’s legislative elections this month, commentary about the country’s economic and financial prospects was growing increasingly pessimistic. With a significant amount of foreign debt coming due next year, the conventional wisdom was that an exchange-rate-based stabilization program – letting the currency depreciate by less than the inflation rate to push inflation down – had led to a massively overvalued currency and an external deficit that was bound to precipitate a crisis. But having written a <a href="https://www.piie.com/bookstore/bailouts-or-bail-ins-responding-financial-crises-emerging-economies">book</a> on currency crises in emerging markets, and having followed Argentine policies closely, I thought this consensus was far off the mark.  </p><p data-line-id="745f1bdd6e804815b32f864ccc920f95"> Breaking from the pattern of past failed economic-stabilization episodes – including those under previous Argentine administrations such as Carlos Saúl Menem (1989-99) and Mauricio Macri (2015-19) – Argentine President Javier Milei used his 2023 election victory to implement the strongest fiscal-austerity and structural-reform policies in the country’s history. In 2024, the primary fiscal adjustment (excluding interest payments) amounted to <a href="https://oecdecoscope.blog/2025/07/07/argentina-consolidating-the-economic-recovery/">5% of GDP</a>, setting the stage for a strong economic rebound after some early softness. </p><p data-line-id="92ce1650b978485282e11cabb19c93e5"> At that point, the Argentine peso may have been modestly overvalued, given the lack of a fully flexible currency regime, but at least the current-account deficit was very small. If the country regained market access, it could roll over its looming external debt liabilities; and if electoral uncertainties could be overcome, Milei’s reforms and the country’s huge natural-resource endowments were bound to attract huge amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) – possibly as much as $70 billion (including financing for a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/openai-sur-energy-weigh-25-billion-argentina-data-center-project-2025-10-10/">$25 billion</a> OpenAI data center). Moreover, the <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">inflation rate</a> had already dropped dramatically from over 100% before Milei’s election to around 30%. </p><p data-line-id="7a2cfc9092c246cc9ce058b60a5aaec7"> Thus, heading into the recent legislative election, Argentina’s problem was about liquidity, not solvency. With electoral uncertainties weighing on growth this year – especially after the Peronist opposition performed better than expected in Buenos Aires’s provincial election in September – investors had grown nervous. Following a couple of corruption scandals and tactical mistakes on Milei’s part, the peso had weakened, despite interventions to keep the exchange rate within a set band. Domestic interest rates surged, Argentina’s sovereign spread widened significantly, and the stock market weakened. If the Peronists could take enough seats to wield an effective veto, Milei’s entire reform program could unravel. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="8f9e9f33de1c41908ba1f914132963b6"> But since Argentina’s problem was merely about liquidity, Milei sought and received a controversial $20 billion swap line from the US Treasury, whose support was conditional on him prevailing in the election. In the event, he and allied parties triumphed, picking up seats in both chambers. By fixating so much on electoral uncertainty, Milei’s political links to US President Donald Trump, and an overvalued exchange rate, the financial commentariat had ignored the promise of his radical fiscal and other reforms. </p><p data-line-id="3f26c0f9a47b46feaafd538e47ae0068"> Now, for the first time in ages, Argentina may escape the policies that have repeatedly driven it into debt defaults and high inflation. After the most recent Peronist administration had pushed the country close to an inflation spiral and another default, Milei started cleaning up the mess with ruthless efficiency. While many have criticized his draconian approach, the results of the October election show that the Argentine people would prefer short-term economic pain over a return to Peronist policies. </p><p data-line-id="e3b0e7c1fa4a4343b2291fd914fa8584"> Milei will now reach out to other moderate forces to build a coalition that can continue his program via legislation, rather than decrees, starting with labor-market and tax reforms. Further economic liberalization will then attract a surge of domestic and foreign investment, ensuring strong economic growth for the future. While no economic policy package is perfect, Milei’s overall approach is sound, especially compared to the failed policies of the past.  </p><p data-line-id="2b5280e0cda44631b8f9c6741214144d"> Yes, the exchange-rate regime will have to become more flexible over time. But proposals for an immediate shift to a fully floating exchange rate or (at the other extreme) full dollarization do not make sense. The first could lead to excessive exchange-rate volatility, especially once capital controls are fully phased out, while the latter – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/argentina-dollarization-peso-donald-trump-javier-milei-3bd3eeab">endorsed</a> by major media outlets like the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> – is not even feasible, because Argentina does not have sufficient foreign-currency reserves. Milei, a vocal libertarian, may have flirted with full dollarization in the past, but he now recognizes that it is not really an option. </p><p data-line-id="748c3e6062744c4b8ada61dc8038c317"> The better option is a currency regime that would allow fluctuations within a wide band, perhaps with targets based on the nominal effective exchange rate together with some monetary aggregate to anchor growth. That would limit volatility while still ensuring that the currency value is competitive, and the external balance positive. The returning flows of capital and new FDI could be used to replenish the country’s dwindling foreign-exchange reserves, lest they drive unwanted currency appreciation. </p><p data-line-id="64f09f4467744d458cb4c51f999fa32e"> The market reaction to the October election confirms that investors are on board with Milei’s strategy. The panic leading up to election day was not about him, but about the prospect of a Peronist return. With the recent electoral uncertainty behind it, Argentina now has a clear path to political stability.  </p><p data-line-id="d5e587b1914f440cb1df1bdb83303bd2"> We will likely see significant inflows of FDI, allowing growth to accelerate over time. Argentina may even become a model for the kind of market-oriented economic reforms and fiscal austerity measures that are needed in other Latin American economies, such as Chile, Brazil, and Colombia – all of which will hold elections in the coming years. </p>

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="e330e3f2b09b45f0be2ccd549926c8c4"> DHAKA – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30) comes at a decisive moment, not just for the climate agenda but for international cooperation more broadly. Following last year’s “finance COP” in Baku – where countries agreed to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop29-un-climate-conference-agrees-to-triple-finance-to-developing-countries-protecting-lives-and">triple</a> the global target for climate finance – this year’s gathering is being framed as the “implementation COP.” </p><p data-line-id="f37e51257a9c4571b316868bf05bdcd3"> After years of negotiations, the time for ambitious commitments has passed. We now need concrete action. That means actually mobilizing climate finance, not as an act of charity, but as a strategic investment in global resilience, shared prosperity, and mutual security. </p><p data-line-id="68972c57aa1f4a5ea8080ac27bb8c96c"> Developing countries are not coming to the table empty-handed. We are bringing ambitious climate plans, national commitments, and domestic financing of our own. Bangladesh, for example, draws 75% of its climate finance from its own resources, and allocates 6-7% of its annual budget to climate-related efforts. </p><p data-line-id="6c5918510ac743f5a8d049791b30a022"> Many developing countries are also submitting updated Nationally Determined Contributions (the Paris climate agreement’s term for emissions-reduction plans), strengthening their policy frameworks, and pioneering locally driven solutions that can inform global best practices. Thus, Bangladesh recently submitted its “NDC 3.0,” which sets an unconditional emissions-reduction target of 6.39% by 2035 (in the business-as-usual scenario), and a conditional target of 13.92%. </p><p data-line-id="555cb46b72d84ed7afe7e4fcfccbb479"> But the total investment required to implement our NDC is a staggering $116 billion. That is why we have also created the Bangladesh Climate and Development Platform (BCDP), a nationally owned mechanism designed to scale up climate finance and integrate national climate strategies. With strong political support, the BCDP brings together more than ten ministries, marking a significant milestone in coordinated, country-led climate action. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9b50a3449c3f4c2ba828670dbdc847cc"> As a coastal country, Bangladesh is home to some of the world’s most fragile ecosystems, including the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the world’s largest river delta. These ecosystems provide essential services such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and disaster-risk reduction. Protecting them is vital not only for Bangladesh, but for the planet. Doing so, however, requires international support. </p><p data-line-id="d83849951dbe4e62a7585395c08d378c"> The same message applies across the Global South. While developing countries are stepping up, their plans require external support. The COP29 commitment to mobilize $300 billion per year in international climate finance, starting next year, must be the baseline. This figure still represents only a small fraction of what is needed, and we still need to ensure that financing is managed with a higher level of accountability. Developed countries must be held to their commitments, so that new funding is truly additional, rather than being repurposed from existing development aid. </p><p data-line-id="b350c2724a884f28b87ed23a37ede956"> Another priority concerns the quality of financing, which must be well structured, accessible, and effective. That means clarifying how much each developed country will contribute; how resources will be balanced between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage; and how delivery will be made predictable and fair. </p><p data-line-id="a2a536755c154e898bf2cb7028382e15"> Loans that push developing countries further into debt are not sustainable. A much larger share of finance must come in the form of grants and highly concessional flows. The world cannot build climate resilience on the back of fiscal instability. This was already a recurring theme in Baku, and now COP30 gives us a chance to translate it into a clear policy framework. </p><p data-line-id="cef703dacdaa485bb50c1aa2b1db997a"> Climate finance is sound economics, representing opportunity, not just obligation. Studies <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-adaptation-investment-case">show</a> that every $1 invested in adaptation can generate more than $10 in long-term benefits. For developed countries, supporting adaptation and resilience abroad helps stabilize supply chains, reduce disaster risks, and prevent future crises that will spill over borders. </p><p data-line-id="d7e35d48c3064f418714baf3a28e9bd2"> At the same time, developing countries hold vast, often untapped, potential to drive the global energy transition, safeguard food systems, and power sustainable growth. Bangladesh, for example, is the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2025/06/09/reinventing-rice-as-countries-cultivate-change">third-largest</a> rice producer. Helping us achieve resilience against climate shocks is critical for domestic and global food security. We also contribute to global value chains through seafood, textiles, and a dynamic, skilled workforce. With young people comprising <a href="http://thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/youths-account-28pc-population-3293161">28%</a> of our population, we have the potential to be a key partner in many growth industries of the future. </p><p data-line-id="a4ea33f39bc34ad3a9a35938c7e19b62"> As an investment in our shared future, climate finance requires partnerships that will benefit everyone – economically, socially, and environmentally. But merely increasing our financing targets is not enough. Last year, developing countries engaged in good faith to reach an agreement on climate finance, even though the outcome did not fully reflect our needs. That commitment to dialogue must now be matched by a commitment to clarity and delivery. We need all countries to engage constructively in shaping the structure of climate finance. The question is not just how much, but how it flows, and how it can best be used to drive long-term transformations. </p><p data-line-id="e29b52fa264040219ef39c207cb165f7"> Already, Brazil and Azerbaijan are co-leading efforts to build a roadmap to scale climate finance to <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t">$1.3 trillion</a> annually by 2035. But we cannot reach that goal without laying the foundation for it. That means delivering the promised $300 billion per year through mechanisms that are transparent, fair, and effective. </p><p data-line-id="b371b9ba379d48fbadd047ce34f5bb72"> With multilateralism in crisis, we must restore faith in the process. Multilateralism has delivered before, and it can do so again. COP30 is where we can prove that the international system is capable of moving from commitment to implementation, and from division to cooperation. We have the tools, and we have the knowledge. What we need now is the will to turn climate finance into a shared engine for growth, security, and a fairer future. </p>

<p data-line-id="2412d0e4e9e548749954cac90bfde1de"> NEW DELHI – For decades, one family has towered over Indian politics. The influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty – including independent India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra – is bound up with the history of India’s struggle for freedom. But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright. This idea has penetrated Indian politics across every party, in every region, and at every level. </p>

The more we swallow these lies now, the harder it will be to question future falsehoods, because that would challenge our view of ourselves as intelligent beings. </p>

<p data-line-id="74b62ca2bc2042679745c9efda1785fb"> BEIJING – Traditional donors have sharply scaled back their aid commitments to developing countries over the past year. Some, like the United States, have virtually eliminated their aid programs. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), official development assistance (ODA) from member countries <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2025/04/official-development-assistance-2024-figures.html">declined by 7.1%</a> in 2024, its first annual drop in six years. </p><p data-line-id="db16ef9778d541498df6d7f1b438603b"> This trend was not limited to a few major donors. Of the 33 members of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC), 22 slashed their aid budgets, and only four countries met the United Nations’ target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income to ODA. </p><p data-line-id="7f360c9899044473881a52a34e9a1261"> The outlook for the coming year offers little hope for improvement, as major DAC donors have announced additional cuts. Most notably, US President Donald Trump’s administration has suspended most foreign aid and dismantled the Agency for International Development (USAID), which dispersed most US government aid dollars.  </p><p data-line-id="67f10eb20fdd480d99dce191574b0874"> Meanwhile, the United Kingdom plans to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o">reduce aid spending</a> from 0.5% of GNI to 0.3% by 2027. Similar retrenchment across Europe and North America is reshaping international assistance, disrupting humanitarian and climate-related programs, and creating financing gaps in critical sectors such as health, education, and clean energy. </p><p data-line-id="9f5025fc6e774589897c6b4d8107b56c"> In our 2017 book <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/going-beyond-aid/B48F59C6D8D2790D403A1A0C44B37612"><em>Going Beyond Aid</em></a>, we urged developing-country governments to reduce their dependence on foreign aid, not only because it was becoming an unreliable source of funding, but also because other, better ways of financing development were becoming more available. That message is more urgent than ever.  </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="f2fbc8217dd44edbaa41c6a024eb3cb9"> As reliance on aid becomes untenable, the international community must mobilize a broader array of financing sources to advance green and sustainable growth. This includes national development banks, industrial investment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and institutional investment in public markets, as well as innovative mechanisms such as debt swaps and public-private partnerships (PPPs). These tools can unlock domestic resources, attract long-term investors, and create synergies between public goals and private capital. </p><p data-line-id="085080d643d242608c20fff83e8cb509"> Equity investment offers a promising avenue for engaging non-traditional development partners while reducing developing countries’ dependence on debt. Government investment funds, public and private financial institutions, and other private actors can participate by taking equity stakes in public enterprises, financing infrastructure projects, or joining PPPs. Such participation not only alleviates debt burdens but also improves the performance and management of public assets.  </p><p data-line-id="77eaaf7f82c14059aa1f5fd1bd351d40"> As government-funded, mission-driven institutions, public development banks (PDBs) have the potential to provide patient capital for green and sustainable investment in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs). Building on the <a href="http://www.dfidatabase.pku.edu.cn/index.htm">pioneering database</a> of public development and financial institutions created by the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University, future research can identify effective ways to harness these institutions to fuel low-carbon growth. </p><p data-line-id="2f5328d4c82f4a5f8af27c762a6e45a3"> Responding to growing demand from the economies of the Global South, development partners have increasingly adopted an “entire value chain” approach to the green transition in recent years. This strategy facilitates transfers of low-carbon technologies, diffusion of digital innovations (including trade in services), and industrial modernization, enabling countries included in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to accelerate their shift toward sustainable development. </p><p data-line-id="a2d0b991d4534f9f96805570ae26520b"> Empirical research supports this approach. An analysis covering 139 countries <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">finds</a> that, following policy directives to incorporate green and low-carbon principles into the BRI, carbon intensity (CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions per unit of GDP) among participating countries declined significantly between 2013 and 2022. These findings are consistent with another <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/the-first-evidence-of-a-take-off-in-solar-in-africa/">recent study</a> showing how China’s solar-energy expansion has helped transform Africa’s power sector. </p><p data-line-id="7e2beb6224ab49b89b05e589fe3cc988"> Investment in infrastructure and industrial development can also generate positive spillover effects. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.70023">shows</a> that the presence of at least one Chinese-financed infrastructure project in a second-order administrative region (comparable to a municipality) is associated with a 5% increase in nighttime luminosity – a widely used proxy for economic activity. Neighboring regions experienced a 10-15% rise in luminosity, indicating that the benefits of such projects extend well beyond the immediate investment site. <br/></p><figure data-line-id="b5f95dd16ef944eb98909a174d97b475"><img data-image="8wr68ph8q7uf" src="https://pic1.xuehuaimg.com/proxy/https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/3269ab77d3d209c71e81f97eafb2c31e.jpg"/></figure><p data-line-id="ff5f8242138c4bda9efed2524f80b643"> These outcomes underscore the critical role of infrastructure investment, particularly in energy and transportation projects. By improving electricity access, affordability, and connectivity, they reduce energy poverty, bolster public services, and stimulate economic activity in underserved areas. </p><p data-line-id="a9eaa69bb62540a6884597c0535298b0"> To meet the evolving challenges of development finance, both traditional and non-traditional donors and creditors should move beyond aid and adopt multidimensional strategies that combine trade, investment, infrastructure, green technology, and digital connectivity, including fintech solutions, to support EMDEs. Importantly, such collaborations should be viewed as a mutual learning process in which partners assume complementary roles and shared responsibilities. </p><p data-line-id="6aa7a3e6b02243cd8146cc264d97fcf2"> To be sure, there have been missteps along the way. China’s financing of coal-fired power plants before 2021, for example, had slowed reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions. But these outcomes, once recognized as policy errors, can help strengthen accountability and foster self-correcting mechanisms within the international development ecosystem. Through ongoing learning and adaptation, global partners can build a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable framework for development finance.  </p>

<p data-line-id="9a2b1e0afa33424396e9285d9cac3321">The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may have delivered a kind of détente, after months of escalating tariff threats by the United States and retaliatory restrictions on rare-earth exports by China. While China had good reason to de-escalate the conflict with the US, however, it remains beset by political and economic weaknesses.</p>

<p data-line-id="a33989bba1144aab990b7bd14f1b3e07"> NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump spent much of the last week of October in Asia. He managed to bring about ceasefires on several fronts of a trade war largely of his own making, after imposing tariffs on friends and foes alike. What he did not do, though, was create enduring structures in the economic sphere or put to rest increasing doubts about the United States’ strategic commitment to the region.  </p>

<p data-line-id="d43472ead1454b9bafbfe948b2660224"> SEOUL – All eyes were on Seoul, South Korea, this week, as Chinese President Xi Jinping met with US President Donald Trump to negotiate a framework for managing their economic relationship. But, to understand China’s economic prospects, another recent meeting also warrants attention: the Fourth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China, where China’s leaders adopted the CPC’s recommendations for the 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development (2026-30). </p>

<p data-line-id="150cc2ef04b24bf2873fa5cba9a8b072"> DUBAI – Almost everywhere, debates about AI remain narrowly focused, indeed almost fixated, on its impact on employment and return on investment.

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="9c31c3bba0ca4f09ba39bd62722ee9cb"> EDINBURGH – Ahead of this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, countries are being urged to embrace an approach to climate action and finance with social protection at its heart. Making this connection could not be more important for protecting human dignity, building community resilience, and maximizing the impact of limited funds. </p>
<p data-line-id="8f22d9be7a68444bb490124f51e7d393"> At COP29 last year, developed economies <a href="https://unctad.org/news/countries-agree-300-billion-2035-new-climate-finance-goal-what-next">agreed</a> to mobilize at least $300 billion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, as part of the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. But least-developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states have rightly criticized the target as vague, unenforceable, and inadequate. In fact, this figure falls far short of need, especially because climate-finance delivery is often highly inefficient. For example, just <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/the-climate-finance-gap-for-small-scale-agrifood-systems/">0.8%</a> of tracked funds reach small-scale agricultural systems. </p>
<p data-line-id="c20e3f41b16d424ea80e5cc7ea2dc50f"> This is where social protection comes in. A 2019 <a href="https://www.ldc-climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LIFE-AR-Evidence-Review-English.pdf">study</a> by the LDC Initiative for Effective Adaptation and Resilience (LIFE-AR) showed that social-protection initiatives can play a powerful role in building climate-resilient communities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">Sixth Assessment Report</a>, released in 2023, echoed this finding. Now, a <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/social-protection-and-inclusive-climate-action-review-social-protection-rural-populations">joint review</a> of 23 Green Climate Fund-funded projects, carried out by the GCF and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), has shown that the integration of climate objectives into social-protection systems can go a long way toward delivering limited finance where it is needed most.  </p>
<p data-line-id="fe8ca9f780d4479cb5ebe01faf42fb97"> There are plenty of proven social-protection models that advance inclusive climate action. For example, Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/893931468321850632/ethiopias-productive-safety-net-program-psnp-integrating-disaster-and-climate-risk-management-case-study">supports</a> over eight million people – including the country’s most climate-vulnerable communities – through cash and food transfers, while responding to short-term shocks like droughts and restoring degraded landscapes. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="76d4d1d7da674b48b4ca03fb1559e255"> Similarly, India’s Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which <a href="https://www.jobguarantee.org/program/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega-or-nrega">reaches</a> more than 60 million rural households, funds climate-smart solutions like rainwater harvesting and afforestation (tree-planting), which protect communities against droughts and floods. Brazil’s Bolsa Verde links income support to environmental stewardship, incentivizing sustainable land use and forest conservation among low-income families in protected areas. </p>
<p data-line-id="22862292bf2046338d6f95a7165e6c18"> The 23 GCF projects sampled in the recent FAO-GCF review show similar promise. Paraguay’s <a href="https://proezavep.mef.gov.py/cms/uploads/Annex_G_Environmental_and_Social_Standard_Management_Framework_Final_4d38a2e571.pdf">Poverty, Reforestation, Energy, and Climate Change Project</a>, which receives technical support from the FAO, ties conditional cash transfers to social-welfare goals, such as the establishment of climate-sensitive agricultural and forestry systems, and emphasizes indigenous participation. Botswana’s <a href="https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/ecosystem-based-adaptation-and-mitigation-botswana-s-communal-rangelands">Ecosystem-Based Adaptation and Mitigation in Communal Rangelands</a> project aims to advance similar goals, with women comprising 60% of its participants. </p>
<p data-line-id="a3804179a72648808f3c89d133f8e813"> But, despite some successes, inclusion remains a formidable challenge. As it stands, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/publications/flagship-reports/world-social-protection-report-2024-26-universal-social-protection-climate">almost half</a> of the world’s population – including many of those most exposed to the effects of climate change – lacks access to any kind of social-safety net. This helps to explain why only three of the projects reviewed in the FAO-GCF report were in low-income countries. Moreover, only six of those projects included people with disabilities, a mere four incorporated young people, and none involved migrants. Of the seven project areas where indigenous peoples were present, only four included them. </p>
<p data-line-id="841d9ca8c59e4508bfab0b5f567e52c3"> Outcomes, too, fell short. For example, the FAO finds that heat stress <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/62b46527-6ddc-4b8b-9078-bc32c14978f5/content">widens the income gap</a> between female-headed and male-headed households by $37 billion a year, and floods by $16 billion. But while several of the 23 GCF projects were gender-responsive, none was transformative. In addition, fewer than half of the GCF projects included efforts to strengthen existing social-protection systems, undermining their long-term sustainability and scalability. Social-insurance mechanisms were absent. </p>
<p data-line-id="bfc8cca21c1440ce8507eda266a83b92"> Improving outcomes will require a fundamental shift in the prevailing approach to designing, financing, and implementing social protection. Rather than continue to depend on short-term project-based grants – the scale of which is necessarily limited – we must emphasize longer-term, coordinated initiatives, focused on building national systems and capabilities, while supporting locally led adaptation. A whole-of-government approach, involving ministries responsible for climate, social protection, and emergency management, is essential. And inclusion must be built into every stage of the process. </p>
<p data-line-id="bd62bacfef824c99adf7a9bf1a2fe3be"> The GCF can play an important role in advancing this shift. It is well-positioned to catalyze additional, longer-term financing for social protection, taking advantage of innovative mechanisms, such as debt-for-climate swaps and green bonds. Furthermore, it recently introduced reforms to its accreditation model, focused on improving transparency, responsiveness, and efficiency, though more flexibility is still needed for low-income countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="1548f8c09fc045daa33a2d6b21ea8316"> But the GCF cannot do it alone. Other multilateral climate funds must also step up, including by establishing dedicated financing tracks and streamlining access for low-income countries. Governments, for their part, must establish social protection as a pillar of their climate strategies, including Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, and the operational frameworks of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage. Development partners and UN agencies must strengthen technical support for inclusive, long-term strategies, not just short-term projects. </p>
<p data-line-id="cb894cc631cb43da9581b9945842312b"> COP30 has been designated the “implementation COP,” focused on turning plans and pledges into actions and outcomes. It thus represents the ideal opportunity to apply the lessons from the FAO-GCF report, which lays out clear pathways for scaling social protection to enhance inclusive climate action. </p>

<p data-line-id="92d77dc44d594768a5b004d926c8afa1"> NEW DELHI – Discussions about climate finance often focus on the most vulnerable countries, such as small island developing states – and for good reason. But the nine major emerging-market economies (EMEs) – Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey – also have significant climate-finance needs, which must be met if the world is to have any chance of achieving its climate goals. Nowhere are those needs larger than in China. </p><p data-line-id="c14083a1fb2f43ee82097d6322275289"> This is a key finding of our <a href="https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Finance-Needs-of-Nine-G20-EMEs.pdf">new study</a>, which examined the climate-finance needs for the four highest-emitting sectors (power, steel, cement, and road transport) in the nine major EMEs for the period 2022-30. We estimate that China’s climate-finance requirements for these sectors amount to some $1.3 trillion – 61% of the total climate finance required by all nine EMEs ($2.2 trillion) – implying an annual average of $155 billion. The steel sector has the highest need (55% of the total), followed by road transport (25%), cement (16%), and power (4%). </p><p data-line-id="79e494264bc04d509474a861f031f422"> Start with steel. In 2022, China accounted for 77% of carbon dioxide emissions from steel production in the nine EMEs. We expect this share to decline to 66% by 2030, as slowing economic growth, falling investment in new infrastructure projects, and declining downstream demand cause China’s annual steel output to drop from 1,020 million tons to 910 million tons. </p><p data-line-id="4cc65755b9b948d6be2b840472ede37b"> Nonetheless, because of the production method used, the carbon intensity of China’s steel industry is particularly high – 1.8 tons emitted per ton of steel produced. Completely decarbonizing the sector will cost China $733 billion, or $80 billion per year until 2030. That is 65% of the total finance needed to decarbonize the steel sectors of all nine major EMEs. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="6e74da3c73cd4422a84d577f99372e0c"> The story is similar in the cement sector. China’s share of total emissions (across the nine EMEs) stood at 70% in 2022, but it is likely to fall to 52% by 2030, as cement production declines from 2,100 million tons to 1,475 million tons. The reason for this decline is simple: 67% of China’s population has already been <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3443">67% urbanized</a>, and the country has largely completed its high-speed rail and road networks, so construction activity is likely to slow in the coming years. But decarbonizing this sector will not be cheap: $453 billion across the nine economies in 2022-30, with China accounting for 48% of the total. </p><p data-line-id="14ef2898319e441ba4c7b9c02e334099"> Like steel, cement is a hard-to-abate sector, where investment in technological solutions for mitigating emissions has not yet led to a significant reduction in costs. Decarbonizing both industries, in China and elsewhere, will thus depend significantly on the large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage technology – a costly proposition. Increased investment in relevant research and development is crucial. </p><p data-line-id="b9f8e68b677d481ca1adc1ffaad4e103"> As for road transport, China is well on its way toward an electric future. The country is responsible for about 70% of all electric vehicles produced globally each year, and in 2022, it accounted for 97% of all EV sales across the nine EMEs – a figure that should decline somewhat, to 73%, by 2030. The share of EVs in China is projected to rise to 63% (45 million units) in 2030, despite a projected decline in overall vehicle sales to 72 million units, compared to 85 million in 2022. </p><p data-line-id="758d91a5738f477284f94f4274b9e1d2"> But completing the transition from internal-combustion-engine vehicles to EVs will still require significant capital expenditure. Developing the necessary charging infrastructure alone will cost $460 billion across all nine countries, with China accounting for a whopping 97% ($446 billion) of the total. This largely reflects the fact that China is developing mainly high-speed charging stations, which cost about seven times more than conventional chargers. </p><p data-line-id="50e29f80cc6e406397529a0cf7a0ba4b"> Finally, there is the power sector, which, perhaps counter-intuitively, will not require huge amounts of climate finance. Here, too, China is already on the right track. While its total installed energy capacity is projected to increase from about 2,800 gigawatts in 2023 to 4,800 GW by 2030, fossil fuels’ share in that capacity should fall from about 45% in 2023 to 35% by 2030, thanks to the rapid expansion of solar and wind energy. </p><p data-line-id="02d08535261546d99af3185013d68b10"> As for cost, China should be able to decarbonize its power sector for about $55 billion in 2024-30, or $8 billion per year, including investments in generation and storage. The total decarbonization-finance requirement for all nine major EMEs over that period should amount to roughly $150 billion.  </p><p data-line-id="2808b75dc6ce4ced8107d33f755528d4"> Taken together, these figures might seem daunting, but for China, they are well within reach. After all, the total climate-finance requirement amounts to just 0.7% of the country’s GDP, and China’s current annual investment rate is about 40% of GDP. Add to that its high savings rate and persistent current-account surplus, and China should be able to meet its own climate-finance needs relatively easily, using only domestic sources. With the climate-finance gaps for the other major EMEs smaller than they seem – India comes in a <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-research-estimates-india-true-climate-finance-needs-by-rakesh-mohan-and-janak-raj-2025-08">distant second</a> – there is reason to hope for progress on meeting the world’s climate goals. </p>

<p data-line-id="c041e853e68441b992dea869c8fa50d7"> PARIS – Like the air we breathe, peace does not typically command our attention until we lose it. That is why the study of peace is inextricably linked to that of war: it seeks to understand the root causes of conflict and illuminate ways to end or avoid violence. But peace is a condition in itself, and it warrants our attention as much today as it did in the 14th century, when the Italian artist Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted his powerful and enigmatic three-panel fresco in the <em>Sala dei Nove</em> of Siena’s Palazzo Pubblico, where Siena’s council of nine magistrates met. </p>

<p data-line-id="96347d88c54f4e6dbfae82f2a70b3a1e"> CAMBRIDGE – We need new ideas to address the three greatest economic challenges of our time: climate change, the erosion of the middle class, and poverty. The first is an existential threat to our physical environment; the second drives polarization and undermines democracy; and the third is a moral scourge for all of us. Yet with authoritarianism and economic nationalism on the rise, there seems to be little reason for optimism on any of these fronts.  </p>

In the mid-1930s, Joseph Stalin used fabricated charges of treason and coerced confessions to purge potential rivals, including many prominent Old Bolsheviks who were subjected to public show trials.

<p data-line-id="757bd012b05641a692cf04c72e2cddba"> BERLIN/BONN – Amid rising geopolitical tensions, pressure to comply with climate obligations increasingly comes from courts. Earlier this year, both the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/187/187-20250723-adv-01-00-en.pdf">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) and the <a href="https://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/opiniones/seriea_32_en.pdf">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACtHR) issued landmark advisory opinions affirming that countries must address climate change, and that failure to do so may carry serious legal consequences. </p>
<p data-line-id="6e8bcec9b43148498fd99dda92f32248"> This renewed legal clarity comes at a critical moment. Last year was the <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level">hottest on record</a>, with global average temperatures exceeding 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, yet the gulf between the urgency of the climate threat and the policy response continues to widen. </p>
<p data-line-id="9c1e0d7ac16449879a77fe074b7afe8d"> In the absence of political will, the legal system has become a key driver of climate progress. As the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30) approaches, the groundwork has been laid for stronger, fairer, and more accountable climate action. The task now is for governments to adapt their policies in accordance with both international law and environmental needs. </p>
<p data-line-id="88ba5e373ee14127b4ca057f9ffc81ae"> The most immediate implication of the ICJ and IACtHR opinions is that national climate plans – known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – must reflect the “highest possible ambition” and be consistent with the 2015 Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. </p>
<p data-line-id="90ac5a8939f2410cb5ff54d541fa1d5a"> Alarmingly, as of 2024, global temperatures are on track to rise by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-set-warm-by-31-c-without-greater-action-un-report-warns-2024-10-24/">up to 3.1°C</a> by the end of the century. Following the September deadline for new NDCs, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-of-global-emissions-covered-by-2035-climate-pledges-after-un-summit-in-new-york/">only half of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions</a> are covered by updated climate pledges, most of which fall well short of science-based targets. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="4b9e57f55de64a168cd7edcec2116563"> The ICJ and IACtHR decisions, however, offer some cause for hope. At COP30, negotiators and civil-society representatives can push for ambitious measures, as noncompliance with the Paris agreement’s temperature goals can be challenged not only in diplomatic forums but also in courts. </p>
<p data-line-id="41045507b2464eefa154989599cdd060"> A rapid phaseout of coal, oil, and gas remains essential to effective climate action. But despite the so-called “<a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/the-uae-consensus-foreword">UAE consensus</a>” to move away from fossil fuels, many countries continue to obstruct progress. Here, too, the ICJ provides negotiators with new tools, explicitly recognizing that governments may be held liable for failure to reduce GHG emissions, including through fossil-fuel production, consumption, exploration, and subsidies. </p>
<p data-line-id="1c33c3beea3e4bba96629066c20ac5e9"> The international climate regime must evolve to reflect these changing legal realities. That requires creating stronger compliance mechanisms that ensure countries meet their targets and deliver on climate-finance commitments. </p>
<p data-line-id="516d67ab0c3f498c8d7264c5878a0ed4"> The legal shift is particularly evident in climate finance. For decades, developed countries have treated funding for climate adaptation and loss and damage as discretionary. Consequently, despite the establishment of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage at COP28, contributions remain far below what is needed. </p>
<p data-line-id="6c2c4542baff40479721feb787d0172a"> The path forward is clear. The ICJ’s opinion affirms that wealthy countries have a legally binding duty to support mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage efforts across the developing world. To meet these obligations, <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-finance-progress-2025">at least $1.3 trillion</a> must be mobilized annually by 2035, with dedicated provisions for loss and damage. </p>
<p data-line-id="0e0a40db35104a8ea0098e5f15d9dc8c"> Crucially, the private sector is not being let off the hook. The ICJ, IACtHR, and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea have all recognized that governments must regulate corporations where necessary to protect the environment, safeguard the climate system, and uphold human rights. </p>
<p data-line-id="61aff407ffa14b99a83a1a15859de2c8"> At the same time, corporate accountability is taking shape in domestic courts<em>. </em>In a landmark decision, Germany’s Higher Regional Court of Hamm <a href="https://rwe.climatecase.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/New%20Era%20of%20Accountability%20EN.pdf">ruled</a> that large emitters can, in principle, be held liable for climate-related impacts. The case, brought by Peruvian farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya, shows that individuals on the front lines of the climate crisis can force polluters to pay their fair share. </p>
<p data-line-id="f4f3176f648848d78d1b6b8e1f8c1435"> But litigation alone cannot deliver justice at scale. Governments must establish clear legal frameworks to hold major emitters fully accountable for their role in driving the climate crisis before the damage becomes irreversible. Mechanisms such as mandatory reserves, disclosure rules, insurance schemes, and compensation funds can help internalize liability risks and embed accountability into the system, rather than leaving it to goodwill or the courts. </p>
<p data-line-id="d42dacc8c3f34413b2997d35b98c7bcd"> The momentum for such measures is building. In countries like the Philippines and Pakistan, as well as US states such as Vermont and New York, lawmakers are advancing “polluter pays” legislation. Remarkably, climate lawsuits, by plaintiffs ranging from <a href="https://www.biv.com/news/environment/bc-first-nation-inches-closer-to-landmark-climate-challenge-against-ottawa-11282212">indigenous groups in Canada</a> to <a href="https://forourclimate.org/newsroom/1113">farmers in Korea</a>, are already invoking the ICJ’s reasoning, and a <a href="https://www.jusbrasil.com.br/noticias/justica-federal-suspende-licencas-de-funcionamento-de-usina-e-mina-de-carvao-por-descumprimento-das-politicas-de-mudancas-climaticas/4560127630?ref=the-wave.net">Brazilian court</a> explicitly cited it when ordering a fossil project to cease operations.  </p>
<p data-line-id="b4afb41bb1864e5c9f5103b792ae7bf7"> Instead of waiting for the next court ruling, governments should now take steps to uphold the rule of law and assume responsibility for confronting the climate crisis. That means charting a credible path toward drastic emission cuts, accelerating the phaseout of fossil fuels, and ensuring that climate finance is effective, equitable, and fit for purpose. At COP30, international policymakers should harness the current legal momentum by proposing a global levy on fossil-fuel profits and high-emitting sectors, including shipping and aviation, to ensure sustainable financing of the Adaptation Fund and the Loss and Damage Fund. </p>
<p data-line-id="26f8a15ce9ab4732835582836a025b60"> A decade after the Paris agreement, the world can no longer afford half-measures. Vanuatu has already announced plans to pursue a new <a href="https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VANUATU-PRESS-RELEASE.pdf">UN resolution</a> aimed at translating the ICJ’s opinion into concrete political action. By supporting this initiative and acting decisively now, policymakers can build a global climate regime capable of delivering real solutions at the speed and scale this crisis demands. </p>

<p data-line-id="8313534d265f46e7a2291a2605954bac"> ATHENS – France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and even Germany are all in fiscal jeopardy, with ballooning liabilities for pensions, welfare programs, and military expenditure that politicians dare not shrink nor fund through higher taxes. Some <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/fiscal-illusion-deficit-spending">conclude</a> that democracy cannot deliver fiscal prudence because the demos cannot be persuaded to live within its means. But there is an alternative explanation: The cause of our fiscal woes is that we live not in democracies but, rather, under oligarchic rule punctuated by periodic elections. </p>

Geniuses of improvisation rely on mastery, which itself comes from practice. They are not just winging it. </p>
