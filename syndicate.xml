<p data-line-id="4e54be93c9c147c1b338010dc6efc600"> COPENHAGEN – It has been 56 years since Neil Armstrong, at the height of the Cold War, set foot on the moon and captured the world’s imagination. But space is no longer simply about exploration and innovation. It has become a front line for security, particularly for Europe. Just days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a Russian <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/cipr/items/740427/en">cyberattack</a> took down a satellite network providing critical connectivity to Europe. And now, both Russia and China are developing weapons to jam, overwhelm, and destroy Europe’s satellites. </p><p data-line-id="19d6311cd87b491b8ce02f9d819ebfaf"> Yet for too long, European ambitions in space have fallen short of what our security demands. We are watching from the sidelines as American companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX crowd us out of low Earth orbit. The European Union’s per capita space spending is around five times less than that of the United States, and half that of <a href="https://space-economy.esa.int/article/287/esa-report-on-the-space-economy-2025">Japan</a>. The Chinese government’s space budget is roughly three times higher than the European Space Agency’s, and our private-sector space investment is approximately one-fourth that of the <a href="https://spaceambition.substack.com/p/china-private-space-ecosystem-of">US</a>. </p><p data-line-id="e8507bcde7c0444c90367b585f1bdc6a"> Faced with these glaring disparities, I see three urgent priorities for Europe. The first is to break the taboo on defense investment in space.  </p><p data-line-id="e9c2d960ed91421a9649ad90d2cd8b3c"> Like drones and AI, space technology has both military and civilian applications. It is also capital-intensive. In the US, defense-related projects and equipment account for roughly 60% of space-related <a href="https://nova.space/press-release/defense-spending-drives-government-space-budgets-to-historic-high/">spending</a>. If Europe is going to develop its space capabilities, it must tap into its defense and security budgets as they rise in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The European Commission’s inclusion of a Space Shield in its <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/e6d5db69-e0ab-4bec-9dc0-3867b4373019_en?filename=White%20paper%20for%20European%20defence%20%E2%80%93%20Readiness%202030.pdf"><u>European<em></em>Defence<em> –</em> Readiness 2030</u></a><u> </u>plan is a step in the right direction, but we must go further. </p><p data-line-id="1ea4219e4ba0451fb2e94c58e2dbdedc"> To that end, we need a European-level policy to drive growth in our space industry. While SpaceX is now essential to the US defense and intelligence communities, Europe has no comparable champion. What we do have, however, are promising space startups that need new funding and the right policy environment to encourage growth in the sector. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="e0118af1d7e54bc0985601c286d7dc53"> The second priority is to ensure that we can act independently in space, just as we must on land, in the air, and at sea. Europe is too often reliant on foreign actors, primarily the US, for key capabilities like launchers, Earth observation, and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems). We must secure these capabilities for ourselves, either through European companies or those willing to invest in Europe’s value chains. Failure to do so would be a profound mistake.  </p><p data-line-id="109916ea763d49c3b3ff041c85ad63f9"> We have seen the US cut off satellite imagery to Ukraine, and we cannot allow that to happen elsewhere in Europe. Real-time intelligence and global surveillance capacity have become essential to modern defense planning. </p><p data-line-id="5ee430b9c9b34919b0baf15d5dae2c59"> As one example of what can be done, I have proposed a joint Nordic satellite constellation for surveillance and secure communications. By pooling defense investment and private-sector expertise across the Nordic countries, we could spread costs, strengthen our collective defense, and boost our space industries.  </p><p data-line-id="abf368dfc2b14eb0ba67deb3b67f9a02"> The third priority is to defend our markets and lead the way on protecting low Earth orbit and the sovereignty it provides. In 2018, there were roughly 2,000 active satellites in space. But that number has since risen above 10,000, and there could be 100,000 or more active satellites by the end of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01655-6.epdf">decade</a>. </p><p data-line-id="168dc720288549279631ab2f3028387d"> Such rapid overcrowding – driven primarily by mega constellations of satellites from a handful of US companies – is an overlooked threat to national security, sovereignty, and our ability to secure safe access to space. When these low-orbit satellites break apart, their debris circulates at speeds eight times faster than a bullet, increasing the risks of Kessler Syndrome: spiraling debris-creating collisions that eventually render low Earth orbit inaccessible. </p><p data-line-id="075ff867f15e44b8aa224398d71c5ea4"> Equally concerning is the growing number of satellites laying claim to finite radio spectrum, the invisible signal highway connecting satellites to Earth. If left unaddressed, the shortage of spectrum and the signal interference from mega constellations will threaten Europe’s ability to maintain the critical security, observation, and communications services that space access enables. </p><p data-line-id="192420ead9ff454694f9fff4af1edf37"> With progress toward new multilateral agreements at the United Nations becoming nearly impossible in the face of the new great power rivalry, and with the Cold War-era rules governing the use of space now woefully outdated, Europe must act. We must protect our markets from those who use space irresponsibly, and – building on the EU Space Act – we must work with like-minded countries to champion new national rules that will ensure space remains accessible to future generations. </p><p data-line-id="7077f09cd7824b90b2fafe3b662c29b1"> Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reminded Europe that we cannot take our security for granted. We should never again be reliant on those who do not share our values – be they erratic Russian autocrats or erratic American billionaires. We must act decisively to address the critical challenges facing our access to space.  </p><p data-line-id="5afa6ee75e5a4ef6be526e9505ac4ac2"> John F. Kennedy once said of America’s moonshot that we do these things “not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” Europe must now do them because they are urgent and necessary. </p>

<p data-line-id="f14483dffcc04ff79c04f9ae74f492b4"> MANAGUA – When indigenous peoples are mentioned in the context of climate change, my mind immediately goes to images of my grandmother’s roofless and flooded house, destroyed by a Category 5 hurricane and a Category 4 storm in quick succession. </p><p data-line-id="0dfed58470d04095a0251fa05eedc10e"> I also move beyond the personal, thinking of the extreme weather swings in the Andes that are damaging agricultural production; the Maasai families in Kenya and Tanzania watching their livestock die from droughts or, increasingly, massive floods; and the communities devastated by landslides in the Philippines’ Cordillera mountains. </p><p data-line-id="a665d13bf8cf4ef1b5f00eb9d31a0a43"> For indigenous peoples, climate change is more than figures and charts; it is a wound that festers, eating away at our land, resources, spirituality, and culture. The extreme weather events that are growing more frequent and severe <a href="https://desapublications.un.org/publications/state-worlds-indigenous-peoples-volume-vi-climate-crisis">disproportionately harm</a> our communities because we rely directly on natural ecosystems. </p><p data-line-id="78c3dbff41b043c981d744255bea8be4"> The decision to hold this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in the Amazon region has raised our expectations significantly. To be sure, the road to Belém has not been easy. We are hopeful about the proceedings, while also approaching them with the caution and clarity that come from having taken part in climate negotiations many times before, only to be ignored. </p><p data-line-id="31f99bf184a94f2d85acca386e928666"> These summits are dominated by national policymakers. Still, we have always insisted that our voices be heard – even from the margins – and will continue to do so. Our aspiration is not only to be invited to the negotiating table and given a say in decision-making, but to help create a collective space where everyone can participate as a valued stakeholder. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="1c872c35c0a34cb0afb15fd1017eeb8f"> With <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2025/11/10/cop30-what-to-expect-from-this-years-un-climate-talks">more than 3,000</a> indigenous people from Africa, the Arctic, Asia, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe expected to attend COP30, the Global Caucus of Indigenous Peoples on Climate Change has developed positions on the summit’s main themes. Whether discussing action on climate finance, adaptation, or mitigation, our rights to self-determination and free, prior, and informed consent concerning all matters affecting our lands, territories, and resources must be recognized. These are not favors or nice-to-haves, but the essential principles of a just climate transition. </p><p data-line-id="61b67b6c71ec4f66b873bab2ea2a31b8"> As COP30’s host, Brazil seeks to make it the “<a href="https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/pre-cop-concludes-with-progress-toward-consensus-on-implementing-agreements-and-strengthening-adaptation">COP of implementation</a>,” which means translating commitments into robust action: capacity and technology transfers, as well as finance that actually reaches those on the front lines of climate change. </p><p data-line-id="b9eb56690d2b4cdba32d86a191cf5c7a"> For indigenous peoples, implementing climate policies requires direct access to predictable and sustainable finance. Instead of being forced to depend on intermediaries who leave us with crumbs, we should be trusted to manage the funds ourselves, allocating them based on our own needs, timelines, and knowledge systems. The problem with climate finance is not a lack of capacity but a lack of trust and political will. </p><p data-line-id="ccf14f783657485081c39da4b9b48197"> Moreover, multilateralism – touted as the path to climate salvation – is often skewed in favor of wealthy countries and influential stakeholders. We need partners who treat us as such, rather than as beneficiaries, who recognize our governance structures, support our initiatives, conduct cultural due diligence, and, above all, encourage genuine dialogue. </p><p data-line-id="6db1309904ad44e68083830f0cccefee"> In debates about how to ensure a just transition, we will continue to stress that clean-energy projects must not be built at the expense of our dispossession. Without strong safeguards, the decarbonization process risks becoming yet another <a href="https://eeb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Sacrifice-Zones-final-layout.pdf">cycle of extractivism</a>. Respect for indigenous peoples’ rights to land and resources must be at the heart of any climate policy. </p><p data-line-id="1575bda2cafb4a5385ecef3b968310ef"> Likewise, adaptation and mitigation must be approached holistically. We cannot continue to measure success only by carbon sequestration; we must also consider the effects of these efforts on livelihoods, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab68a9#erlab68a9s3">mental and spiritual health</a>, and the cultural continuity of indigenous peoples. </p><p data-line-id="d2e7a5ff5a024684aafb3e53bbed110e"> Governments and other institutions must be held accountable at COP30 for the promises they have made over the years. Words should become tangible commitments, particularly in regard to providing indigenous peoples with direct access to finance. This will require a decisive shift in mindset: climate action must do good, not merely avoid harm. </p><p data-line-id="62c3d94eebc44bfabcce130583d1595b"> Indigenous peoples, when viewed from this perspective, are part of the solution. Caring for the planet is embedded in our knowledge systems – restoring a forest, protecting a lagoon, and preserving traditional seeds are everyday tasks for us. But to carry out this work, we need real recognition and support from the international community. </p>

<p data-line-id="406cf7297fab47c7879b36d181db5065"> NEW YORK – America’s role in international aid has been turned upside down since January, with institutions shuttered, policies upended, and funding slashed. It is now unclear what lies ahead for American policy, the international aid system, or the world’s poorest. All we know is that a massive gap needs to be filled. </p>

<p data-line-id="6f66fb8fb69c42f99b3a52e818f7f0ca"> MILAN – During a recent trip to Kazakhstan, I was struck by people’s enthusiasm for AI. Virtually everyone I encountered – including academics, policymakers, and entrepreneurs – seemed convinced that the technology will help solve thorny challenges, from diversifying the economy away from dependence on natural resources to expanding access to critical services, particularly for remote populations. I had expected the diffusion of knowledge about AI to be slower, but perhaps their positivity should not have surprised me. After all, the rapid development of AI implies important opportunities for emerging economies. </p>

<p data-line-id="5035c49c696b418cbeac1a55c00add48"> LJUBLJANA – Emancipatory movements around the world rightly rejoiced at Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race.

<p data-line-id="790702c866b7450ea905d73d9c9c16b8"> GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.” </p>

In this sense, Takaichi has already followed in the footsteps of her <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/japan/japan-sanae-takaichi-new-prime-minister-drummer-policies-b2849747.html">political idol</a>, Margaret Thatcher – the United Kingdom’s first female prime minister.

    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="7b6f3215698f4a0eb30f2c6769efbf21"> SÃO PAULO – With the United Nations Climate Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, approaching, it is clear that the world’s widely shared commitment to a just energy transition is falling by the wayside. In the year since governments signed on to the agreement at COP29 to scale up climate finance – with a goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 – wealthy countries have been retreating from their financial pledges. Worse, these signs of bad faith are coming just as the costs of climate adaptation and decarbonization in developing countries are mounting. </p>
<p data-line-id="fc5705a95e1c465cb8fdfa9e92fc5927"> If the Global North is no longer willing to meet its funding promises, as now seems certain, it can still demonstrate good faith, nonetheless, through another form of solidarity: sharing the knowledge, technology, and intellectual property that underpin the green transition. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9624c52476b4d388d9c0a2607779146"> This is not an issue that can be deferred. The shift to a green economy is already reproducing the same asymmetries that have long defined global trade. Instead of fostering inclusive development, climate policy is increasingly being shaped by protectionist measures and IP regimes that entrench technological monopolies in the Global North. For example, the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism may be billed as a safeguard against carbon leakage; but it also illustrates how climate policy can be used to justify protectionist trade measures. </p>
<p data-line-id="1f2e87891de641b9aebd15b8d84cf63d"> Moreover, China’s recent <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/china-files-wto-complaint-against-india-over-ev-battery-subsidies-urges-new-delhi-to-rectify-wrongdoings/articleshow/124571889.cms">complaint</a> against India for its electric-vehicle and battery subsidies shows how green industrial policies are increasingly becoming grounds for trade disputes. Together, these developments signal a growing tension between climate goals and World Trade Organization rules. Could measures to address climate change soon become a new impetus for economic exclusion? </p>
<p data-line-id="93bf01789124457a821484db8d68aa0b"> At the heart of this issue lies a stark imbalance: larger powers like China, the United States, and the EU are producing high-value green technologies, while most developing countries are stuck exporting low-value green commodities – primarily critical minerals. This mirrors the colonial-era division of labor, whereby the Global South supplied raw materials, and the North supplied innovation, monopolized production, and reaped the largest profits. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="f43bc6c24e0b4c2ba6f23b66033106d0"> Data from the World Intellectual Property Organization <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_econstat_wp_44.pdf">underscore</a> the depth of this divide. Green patents (relating to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation) are overwhelmingly concentrated in a handful of countries, such as China, the US, Japan, and Germany. Between 2000 and 2024, the top ten economies accounted for nearly 90% of international patent filings in solar and wind technologies. Brazil, despite ranking sixth globally in installed wind capacity, contributed only 0.4% of global wind patents. For solar, its share was a mere 0.19%. </p>
<p data-line-id="f2f8211539cf44bcbc6b44ad4cb1fbf2"> This technological concentration is not accidental. It is the result of a global IP regime that privileges monopoly profits over public goods. Efforts to foster more global coordination, including through the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS) agreement, have failed to address the fundamental problem. </p>
<p data-line-id="b1e4bb04008646e1be5d1989d7171c9c"> Without access to affordable technologies, the Global South cannot fully participate in the climate transition. Worse, the current system risks locking developing countries into a new form of dependency, supplying the minerals for batteries and solar panels but lacking the means to produce them. </p>
<p data-line-id="6274447ec049417381b03bdedf9a4303"> Climate finance is not sufficient to break this cycle. Instead, technology transfers and reforms to the global IP regime must be at the center of climate negotiations. While the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris climate agreement do acknowledge this, little progress has been made. </p>
<p data-line-id="7fae00315285470083be566db1f4ebd8"> Fortunately, there is a precedent for the necessary changes. Back in the 2000s, Brazil played a pivotal role in categorizing access to HIV/AIDS medicines as a public good, rather than as a commodity governed solely by IP rights. This shift was driven by a combination of legal, political, and civil-society actions that challenged the global pharmaceutical patent regime and put public health first. </p>
<p data-line-id="f92fb8141ad549fbb13305c57c33e2a0"> As the Nobel laureate economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-e-stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a> has <a href="https://cgt.columbia.edu/news/stiglitz-wealth-health-intellectual-property-laws-facing-counterattack/">argued</a>, such mechanisms are essential to correct market failures and ensure equitable access to innovation. That is why the International Court of Justice, in its recent <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/187/187-20250723-pre-01-00-en.pdf">advisory opinion</a> on climate change, underscored the obligation of all states to cooperate – beyond the provision of finance – on the development and diffusion of green technologies, including by sharing knowledge and engaging in technology transfers.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3da193e1fd4c43dc88bb2d4b08cc0d5a"> The Technology Implementation Program that was agreed at COP28 offers a means to foster such cooperation. Under Brazil’s leadership at COP30, TIP can become a platform for strengthening national innovation systems, enabling countries to adapt technologies to local contexts and build capacity for climate solutions. The idea is to use a mix of public and private money to support trial projects, and then to scale those that prove effective. </p>
<p data-line-id="a2e001acf81445b5a88da182c39296eb"> For example, we could support a pilot that aims to produce low-carbon fertilizer using green hydrogen. Currently, ammonia – the key input for nitrogen fertilizers – is made using hydrogen from fossil fuels, which is why the sector is responsible for roughly <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/fertiliser-emissions-could-be-cut-to-one-fifth-of-current-levels-by-2050/">1-2% of global carbon dioxide emissions</a>. By replacing fossil-based hydrogen with renewable (green) hydrogen, the same ammonia output would produce far fewer emissions, as well as offering a scalable, locally adaptable solution. If the pilot succeeds in this hard-to-abate sector, it will create a replicable model for other countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9b63c1d0a614c9b874d378bffc672cb"> Brazil’s COP30 presidency can rally the Global South behind a vision of TIP that delivers climate justice through innovation. This is not just a technical agenda, but a political one. Only by empowering countries with access to green technologies can they build the capacity they need. And by helping the rest of the world decarbonize, wealthy countries will be helping themselves. </p>

Stocks keep hitting record highs. And Asian and Gulf countries have pledged trillions of dollars in foreign direct investment in the US during the Trump presidency. </p>

<p data-line-id="abde84e9846a46288ce1c8a167a6ff10"> BERLIN/SANTIAGO – AI is often portrayed as the harbinger of a prosperous, more efficient future. But the machines driving this revolution depend on a resource far older – and far more contested – than data or electricity: water. </p><p data-line-id="848284dd839c408fbf35a15a7211d03f"> As the Heinrich Böll Foundation’s recent <a href="https://eu.boell.org/en/WaterAtlas">Water Atlas</a> makes clear, AI’s rapid growth is depleting local water reserves around the world, from drought-stricken Chile to South Africa. Its physical footprint reflects a new form of colonial extraction; instead of silver and soy, now it is the cooling water that keeps the digital economy running. </p><p data-line-id="93706a1868494ca3b99d769fbb7ad78d"> While the debate about AI’s energy use focuses on the power needed to train and operate large language models, what is often overlooked is the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-water-usage">vast amount</a> of water required to cool data centers, not to mention the water used in energy production and hardware manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="4ad43f25c1174e8d9ec8f9062a0331c9"> ChatGPT is a prime example. Training GPT-3 required <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3724499">roughly 700,000 liters of water</a> for cooling alone. A Greenpeace study <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/publikationen/20250514-greenpeace-studie-umweltauswirkungen-ki-eng.pdf">estimates</a> that data centers will consume 664 billion liters annually by 2030, compared to 239 billion liters in 2024. </p><p data-line-id="88280c6ae108411aae31356aeec80dd7"> AI’s benefits are concentrated in the Global North, yet its environmental costs increasingly fall on the Global South. In 2023, mass protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center">erupted</a> in Uruguay over a proposed Google data center as the country suffered its worst drought in 70 years. With reservoirs running dry, authorities began pumping brackish water from the Río de la Plata estuary into public systems, <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/where-cloud-meets-cement/">granting Google permits</a> to draw from the remaining freshwater reserves even as working-class families boiled salty tap water to drink. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="81e2c009287345e4943254bf560325d0"> A similar conflict has unfolded in Chile, one of Latin America’s most drought-prone countries. In Santiago’s Cerrillos district, a proposed Google data center was projected to consume <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#chile">7.6 million liters of water per day</a> – roughly equal to the entire community’s annual use. In response, activists from the local group MOSACAT launched a legal and political campaign that forced a redesign of the cooling system and a new environmental review. </p><p data-line-id="18fff99b83a34f1e8381524749e42914"> These community struggles highlight a familiar pattern in which corporations and governments present data centers as engines of modernization while downplaying their environmental costs. In Mexico’s Querétaro region, where rural and indigenous communities already face severe water scarcity, the problems go far beyond depletion: diesel emissions from backup generators cause air and noise pollution; electronic waste imported from the Global North continues to pile up; and growing demand for land, housing, and electricity is driving up costs and straining local infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="672c998899f14568a6ea15566fb36c27"> Regulation has done little to slow this expansion or improve environmental standards. While the European Union’s 2024 <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">AI Act</a> mandates transparency on energy demand and computing power, it says nothing about water use. Even the <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, which requires data centers to report water consumption, applies only to data facilities <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/europes-thirst-for-ai-runs-into-local-water-worries/">within the EU</a>. Moreover, reporting is not the same as reform: efficiency – limited by technology and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox">Jevons paradox</a> (which occurs when greater efficiency boosts demand for a resource) – too often distracts from the deeper question of sufficiency. </p><p data-line-id="8abc775c92444977ae7e347d837a6deb"> At the same time, many developing economies compete for tech investment by offering generous tax breaks and fast-tracking environmental permits with minimal oversight. Governments tend to frame this as advancing data sovereignty, but Big Tech ultimately holds the power. Moreover, contrary to official promises, data centers create few jobs, and structural inequalities continue to impede the growth of local AI industries. For example, criticism of Brazil’s data center policy <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/brazil-is-handing-out-generous-incentives-for-data-centers-but-what-it-stands-to-gain-from-it-is-still-unclear/">highlights</a> its focus on attracting large tech firms, while neglecting fair competition for domestic companies. </p><p data-line-id="2fe603369b514eb68828c6bda251248a"> Environmental impact assessments are another weak link. Studies <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#ekurhuleni">show</a> they are frequently incomplete, inaccurate, or hidden from public scrutiny. In Chile, regulators approved Google’s project despite unresolved issues concerning groundwater rights. In Mexico, activists spent months fighting for access to water-use documents. And in South Africa and Brazil, companies often negotiate directly with national ministries, bypassing local authorities altogether. </p><p data-line-id="85719541c82b4595b32ad8bb310a4a19"> All of this raises a critical question: Who gets a say when digital growth depends on local water sources? Like its benefits, the risks of AI are unequally distributed. For many Latin American and African communities, opposition to data centers is not a rejection of progress but an effort to redefine it. Their defense of water reserves challenges the fantasy of infinite digital expansion in a world of finite resources. </p><p data-line-id="1a7dec09f17d4f64bc1367deb69c41a8"> The problem isn’t one of innovation but of distribution. Sustainable cooling systems that use recycled water, saline water, and rainwater already exist, and air-based systems and heat recovery can further reduce freshwater use. But companies have little incentive to adopt these alternatives when water is cheap, unregulated, and invisible on balance sheets. Another, deeper problem lies in AI’s very nature: its intensive computing demands ever-greater water consumption. </p><p data-line-id="42a520c220774e0fb03b6c39d438921b"> Addressing these challenges requires reconciling technological ambition with the realities of today’s escalating climate and ecological crises. Otherwise, AI’s unchecked growth risks turning water-stressed regions into <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sacrifice-zones">sacrifice zones</a>. </p><p data-line-id="fbc94be9424d40caae1b74ec2aaffa8e"> This task – shaping a humane and sustainable technological future – is not one that individuals and communities can accomplish on their own. Political leaders must take urgent steps to democratize decision-making, ensure accountability, and align technological innovation with planetary boundaries. </p>

<p data-line-id="da03fb628d9e424b99c90ce9b13b72b9"> PROVIDENCE/CHARLOTTESVILLE – News media tend to focus on the world’s major powers, because they command more resources by dint of their relatively larger economies, militaries, and energy endowments. But there are costs to such dominance. For example, a single American Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier costs $13 billion, while the F-35 fighter jet costs around $100 million. So, if you can build your military equipment for less than your opponent, you can gain a strategic advantage. </p>

<p data-line-id="e7ab1803d50647a685bdd366cc4d195b"> NEW DELHI – Efforts to mitigate climate change have largely focused on the shift away from fossil fuels in energy production. As a result, most climate-finance assessments have studied the costs of such a transition and determined that large investments are required to deploy cleaner sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="091cd489d9c641a2abe24517e966d170"> But in a new <a href="https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Finance-Needs-of-Nine-G20-EMEs.pdf">working paper</a>, we found that shifting the energy sector to renewables is relatively affordable for emerging-market economies (EMEs) in the G20. Our study measures the climate-finance needs from 2022 to 2030 of Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power, road transport, cement, and steel sectors, which account for about half of such emissions in these nine EMEs. </p>
<p data-line-id="004fb6b43fef47a0be50a35015e29f63"> For starters, we found that the clean-energy transition is advancing at a steady pace. The power sector accounts for about 27% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in these nine EMEs, which together account for 44% of global power-sector emissions. To meet increasing energy demand and climate targets, these economies have focused on incrementally phasing out the use of fossil fuels in power generation and replacing them with renewables. Between 2023 and 2030, the share of clean energy in their total installed capacity is projected to rise from 54% to 65%, while their total installed capacity of renewables should almost double, from 2,150 gigawatts to 4,220 gigawatts. </p>
<p data-line-id="8e2568bc3e1f4cb0a65e246b81c31bbf"> The largest shifts during this period are expected in India and South Africa, where the share of renewables is set to rise from 45% to 63% and from 25% to 42%, respectively. China is also making significant advances, with its share of renewables projected to increase from 55% to 65%. In seven of these EMEs (excluding Indonesia and South Africa), more than half of the total installed power capacity will come from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="31264edcaeec4adfb1bcec3348a2db74"> This is possible because rapid technological developments and China’s massive push into green manufacturing have dramatically lowered the cost of establishing solar and wind farms in recent years. Globally, the cost of installed solar PV and onshore wind <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osgttinf2024d3_en.pdf">decreased</a> by 83% and 42%, respectively, between 2010 and 2022.  </p>
<p data-line-id="97e2f7b3b5cc4dc09fd38dbc8dd3024c"> In addition, the cost of batteries has also <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-can-innovation-help-secure-future-battery-markets-and-mineral-supplies">fallen</a> – by about 90% between 2010 and 2023 – driven by innovation and lower raw-material costs. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity projects are also more affordable now, especially in China and India, owing to favorable topographic conditions, low labor and material costs, and relatively streamlined regulatory and permitting processes. </p>
<p data-line-id="dfe57aa9176344488faebc348e1952de"> Given the falling costs of renewable energy, the G20’s EMEs will need only $121 billion in climate finance for power generation – the amount over and above the investment required in a business-as-usual scenario – between 2024 and 2030. According to our estimates, capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power plants will decline by $156 billion over that period, while spending for clean power will increase by $277 billion. Most notably, India and China will save $43 billion and $52 billion, respectively, on capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power sources but will need to increase such spending on renewables by $90 billion and $102 billion, respectively. </p>
<p data-line-id="d2aaa18b4d444bb19b6b5abe891661f9"> Storage costs (both battery and pumped storage) for renewables will likely entail additional capital expenditure of $28 billion for these EMEs, bringing the overall climate finance needed for 2024-30 to $149 billion, or $21 billion annually. Excluding China, the remaining eight EMEs will require $94 billion, or $13 billion annually, in cumulative climate finance (including storage costs) to shift to renewable sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="93a15039527c4fcf89b6c8f174dbbc18"> These estimates do not account for the additional costs of adapting electricity grids to cleaner energy sources. Large-scale growth in AI and data centers may also increase energy demand more than envisaged. </p>
<p data-line-id="810deb1c59b84f4eb663923b9ffc0d35"> Of the nine EMEs we studied, India is projected to need the largest amount of climate finance – $57 billion, or 38% of the total estimate – to continue decarbonizing the power sector, while China will require slightly less, around $55 billion, because the increase in renewables’ share of installed capacity is expected to be more pronounced in India than in China. Climate finance as a percentage of GDP will likely be largest in South Africa, at 0.25%, followed by India (0.13%) and Mexico (0.09%). </p>
<p data-line-id="5ac7267a17a14c95bf81571b9a355ce0"> A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that financing the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, in the intervening years, the cost of renewables has fallen dramatically. Compared to road transport, cement, and steel in the nine EMEs we studied, the power sector will require the least amount of climate finance for the foreseeable future, even after accounting for storage costs and low renewable load factors. Now that decarbonizing the energy system is much more affordable in EMEs, there is no excuse not to do so. </p>

<p data-line-id="b3fbdc63119c4b7fad15bc8c57ab8374"> BRUSSELS – In a face-to-face meeting last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reached a truce in their countries’ long-running trade war. Trump lowered tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for the rollback of Chinese export controls on rare earths. Many have depicted the deal as a victory for China: by raising the specter of a rare-earth supply shortage, Xi forced the US to make concessions on tariffs. But a closer look at the numbers suggests that China is not the rare-earth juggernaut it might seem to be. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfc5e73178c34b13b0d7379aa178fc2f"> CHICAGO – In a recent <em>Financial </em><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f6be08a-fd24-4558-b373-6ada31e18900" target="_blank">commentary</a></span>, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins argued that, “the SEC should only require companies to supply information under the objective standard of whether a reasonable investor would regard it as important to an investment decision. Rules written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment fail this test – and fail investors.” </p><p data-line-id="981256e5a26845ebb0f2b5d92bfc65f8"> At face value, Atkins’ statement seems unexceptional. But it leaves open a key question: What is material to a firm’s financial performance? Atkins suggests that disclosure should not be driven by “political fads or distorted objectives,” citing the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which expands and standardizes corporate sustainability reporting to improve transparency and comparability of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information. Such disclosures, he argues, “may be socially significant but are not generally financially material.”  </p><p data-line-id="fd2eddf66f2e4ae6b2672ffe904754c1"> But this sounds like wishful thinking. If European regulators think the environment matters and they act on that belief, that materially affects multinational firms’ costs of doing business in Europe. Just last month, a Paris <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f3e072e-d136-4174-ad74-d5bbc14e8a99">court</a> found TotalEnergies had engaged in “misleading commercial practices” by claiming it was “a major actor in the energy transition.” Citing EU legislation that requires green claims to be supported by “objective, publicly available, and verifiable commitments and targets,” the court found the company’s climate pronouncements to be inconsistent with its expanded investments in hydrocarbons. While the fines Total has incurred are small, such fines are likely to be larger in the future – and thus material to investors. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="7282690d004044cc9e4bd8131856e1d2"> Obviously, US regulators today put little weight on companies’ green strategies or the need to disclose them. But if regulators elsewhere care more, such strategies are still material to firms that do business across borders. And since there is a deep divide in the United States between Democrats and Republicans on the merits of ESG policies, a company that avoids ESG-related actions during the current administration might find itself hamstrung in a future one. Shouldn’t investors who value long-run earnings be able to make their own judgments about these issues? Regardless of whether ESG is a political fad (or whether opposition to it is), disclosures of ESG-aligned practices may still be material to the bottom line. </p><p data-line-id="593b688c3d4142ec97f0b630b482b93c"> Nor are regulators the only ones who might care. In the TotalEnergies case, the concern was that customers will be misled by the company’s environmental pronouncements. In a warming world, it is reasonable to expect that some people’s purchasing decisions might well be swayed by a company’s environmental practices.  </p><p data-line-id="88fb40cfaa354cd0b734ba66a975eeac"> Moreover, research <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bbr/a/THJmk5T7WKCKTJgXvT8NnQt">suggests</a> that Brazilian firms with better environmental practices (when certified by regulators) attract more skilled workers and ultimately perform better. Thus, whether environmental practices command universal political appeal is beside the point. If they attract a preferred kind of worker and enhance a firm’s bottom line, the company’s shareholders would want to know about it. </p><p data-line-id="a408f572609444aeb7bc245fca049710"> Atkins does raise a potentially valid concern about the intended audience for corporate disclosures. He opposes rules “written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment.” But, again, what if some shareholders are willing to sacrifice returns for socially beneficial practices? Should their preferences be ignored?  </p><p data-line-id="91fb1d0b89804e89a7f0f95e6a4ff7e8"> The argument for focusing solely on financial returns has always been that, by doing so, the firm empowers minority investors to go and spend their enhanced share of wealth on whatever social or political cause they prefer. The company does not need to cater to their whims to empower them. Yet Oliver Hart of Harvard and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luigi-zingales">Luigi Zingales</a> of the University of Chicago make a <a href="https://hart.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/companies-should-maximize-shareholder-welfare-not-market-value">compelling argument</a> that shareholders may prefer that the company act directly on their concerns. The shareholder-value argument suggests that a firm should continue to pollute the environment to maximize profits and its share price, because its environmentally conscious shareholders can then use some of their enhanced wealth to fund a clean-up. But the problem with this view should be obvious: Environmental remediation tends to be much more costly than preventing pollution in the first place, so shareholders and society alike would be better off if the firm sacrificed some profits to follow cleaner practices. </p><p data-line-id="b3c15f1081734448881a0cbc8dd8e687"> Put differently, the SEC cannot simply dismiss socially motivated investors as a nuisance, because this cohort may form the majority in some firms, and their interests may not be served if the firm simply maximizes profits. In a world where investors are inundated with information, the SEC is right to ask what is and is not material. Mandatory SEC disclosures are valuable insofar as the information is more reliable than anything that is voluntarily disclosed. Since disclosure does impose a burden on firms, it should be mandated judiciously.  </p><p data-line-id="36dcc4f6e94a4239b6bfaa2bc60f4ccf"> But the SEC must recognize that a wide variety of interests look at such disclosures, and that their effects are material. To dismiss these concerns as political is to engage in politicization oneself. It is better to recognize that there are many channels through which disclosure can affect investors and society, and then make the necessary tradeoffs in SEC mandates. </p>

<p data-line-id="3dd3917fa757457eb435f061c4db58f6"> BEIJING – According to US President Donald Trump, his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping – the first of his second term – was “amazing.” Trump may have campaigned on the promise of squeezing America’s biggest geopolitical competitor, but that is not what has happened. Instead, top Chinese academics and retired military leaders whom I spoke to in Beijing this week all agree that Xi’s international strategy has been vindicated, and that an increasingly fractured multipolar world is working very much to China’s advantage. </p>
