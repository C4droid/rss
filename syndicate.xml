<p data-line-id="790702c866b7450ea905d73d9c9c16b8"> GENEVA/PARIS – In early 2021, the European Union shelved the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment it had negotiated with China after the United States signaled its disapproval. At the time, deferring to the new US administration seemed prudent, because Europe was eager to rebuild transatlantic unity after Donald Trump’s first term. For a while, it looked like a wise move: US President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-biden-jr">Joe Biden</a> soon rejoined the Paris climate agreement and proclaimed that “America is back.” </p><p data-line-id="e1b0f11b665f41aeb38eea8c960509bf"> To be sure, the relationship between Europe and the Biden administration was not frictionless, especially after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which mobilized tens of billions of dollars to support US industries. Overall, though, transatlantic disputes were contained, and America’s steadfast support for Ukraine appeared to have shored up transatlantic relations. </p><p data-line-id="adbe884bb208410cae7e6ad45b76f529"> But since Trump’s return to the White House, transatlantic solidarity has again curdled into strategic vulnerability. Sweeping US tariffs have hurt friends and foes alike. Fearing a complete withdrawal of US military support for Ukraine (or worse), European Commission President <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a> agreed to a one-sided handshake trade deal with Trump in Scotland. Meanwhile, the US has continued to dismantle the postwar order, regarding it as what Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.state.gov/opening-remarks-by-secretary-of-state-designate-marco-rubio-before-the-senate-foreign-relations-committee">calls</a> a “weapon being used against us.” </p><p data-line-id="d1802f1410cb4e5abd2aa4d904191673"> After again withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, Trump is actively undermining renewable energy and climate action more broadly. In mid-October, the US unilaterally <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-blocks-a-global-fee-on-shipping-emissions-as-international-meeting-ends-without-new-regulations">sabotaged</a> a recently agreed International Maritime Organization compact on reducing emissions from shipping; and this month, it will do what it can to derail an ambitious agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil.  </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="6f80e87c3de14e84ba92198010cda541"> Tragically, with the world missing meaningful chances to keep global temperatures near the Paris targets, the risk of a deeper unraveling has grown. That may suit US short-term interests and the fossil-fuel lobbies, but it will spell disaster for the planet – especially the most vulnerable developing countries. </p><p data-line-id="65b8232028d14956bab497e900d70826"> The one point on which Republicans and Democrats agree is that China must not be allowed to supplant the US as the de facto leader of the international order. While the latest rapprochement between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may de-escalate bilateral tensions for a while, it certainly does not change the nature of a rivalry that will shape international relations for many years, if not decades. </p><p data-line-id="77142e07c57e418097cf6853d845ecff"> Faced with American nationalism and Chinese assertiveness, Europe can no longer afford strategic passivity. Despite its economic weight, it has not been a player in this game, and certainly not in the contest for global dominance.  </p><p data-line-id="18ae56d5a4b04489826351ebfeca32c6"> As a supporter of a rules-based international order, Europe cannot side comfortably with either China or Trump’s America. But in an increasingly multipolar world, it does have enough clout to tilt the balance one way or another. While it has so far sided with the US, the Trump administration’s unpredictability and belligerence give Europe reason to consider alternative options. </p><p data-line-id="a49cf1188dbb4bfeb9ea698ba074b904"> Yes, the EU has its own grievances vis-à-vis China. But the two also have ample common ground, not least when it comes to climage change and the energy transition. As the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gases and top producer of clean tech, China’s manufacturing future hinges on the success of the global green transition. </p><p data-line-id="b1ae60c910d14aa298915b2a0fc449c2"> China and Europe thus share a strategic interest in advancing the climate transition across emerging markets and low-income countries. After all, the fate of the climate – and of the natural environment – increasingly depends on developing economies, which already account for the bulk of current and future emissions. If their growth continues to be powered by fossil fuels, the resulting climate-driven damage will impose mounting costs on everyone. As we show in a recent <a href="https://cepr.org/publications/policy-insight-144-building-coalitions-climate-transition-and-nature-restoration">policy paper</a>, it is far more cost-effective to help emerging markets and developing economies expand through renewable energy than to pay for rapidly increasing climate-related costs. </p><p data-line-id="ab77e7fb0f9644a3b4408c052d68c6ec"> To that end, a pragmatic partnership between Europe and China could help not only Europe and China, but all current and future generations. What would it take to pull it off? Given low mutual trust, several conditions must be met. </p><p data-line-id="e3c7466584584c91b3e0f2b5255d09a5"> First, trade frictions must not become a stumbling block as Chinese net exports surge (owing to weak domestic demand), and as trade is redirected away from the US and toward Europe. To prevent increased frictions, both sides must show maturity and agree on a clear quid pro quo.  </p><p data-line-id="b498d661dc8b4b918b43e2b8a7f66e4e"> As French and German economists proposed in a recent <a href="https://www.sachverstaendigenrat-wirtschaft.de/fileadmin/dateiablage/Publikationen/FGCEE/FGCEE_Joint_statement_China_250828.pdf">memo to both governments</a>, Chinese access to the European market should be unconditional for certain goods such as solar panels, but still conditional on Chinese direct investment in, and technology transfers to, Europe for goods like electric vehicles; at the same time, imports should remain severely restricted in certain industries deemed critical for national security. </p><p data-line-id="637a4b26e569491eb7c6398736d336f0"> The second and most challenging condition is geopolitical. Most Chinese analysts regard Europe as a mere vassal of the US, and see the war in Ukraine as a conflict between the latter and Russia over their relative spheres of influence.  </p><p data-line-id="52f15490a9674f2f89b5df64190cc4ae"> Europeans, of course, have a different reading. They see Russia as an aggressive neo-imperial power that aims to get its hands on Europe if it can manage to neutralize Ukraine. In a context where the US is increasingly fixated on Asia and the rivalry with China, the Kremlin’s brazen hybrid war on Western Europe makes its intentions clear. A trade and climate partnership would serve the common interest of both China and Europe. But it can be envisioned only if China ends its support for Russian aggression and adopts a more neutral stance. The quid pro quo would be that Europe asserts real strategic autonomy vis-à-vis the US. </p><p data-line-id="04fb7e7b34134409bf013e6906b77e6d"> If Europe and China can meet these conditions, they can lay the foundation for a green, rules-based partnership – not against America, but in defense of the global commons and their own future. </p>

But if Russian President Vladimir Putin can shrug off the deaths of hundreds of thousands of his soldiers, does that mean Ukraine and Europe are destined to live with an endless conflict? </p>

</header>
</li>
    <br/> <div class="article__body article__body--commentary english" data-page-area="article-body" dir="ltr" itemprop="articleBody">
<p data-line-id="7b6f3215698f4a0eb30f2c6769efbf21"> SÃO PAULO – With the United Nations Climate Conference (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, approaching, it is clear that the world’s widely shared commitment to a just energy transition is falling by the wayside. In the year since governments signed on to the agreement at COP29 to scale up climate finance – with a goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 – wealthy countries have been retreating from their financial pledges. Worse, these signs of bad faith are coming just as the costs of climate adaptation and decarbonization in developing countries are mounting. </p>
<p data-line-id="fc5705a95e1c465cb8fdfa9e92fc5927"> If the Global North is no longer willing to meet its funding promises, as now seems certain, it can still demonstrate good faith, nonetheless, through another form of solidarity: sharing the knowledge, technology, and intellectual property that underpin the green transition. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9624c52476b4d388d9c0a2607779146"> This is not an issue that can be deferred. The shift to a green economy is already reproducing the same asymmetries that have long defined global trade. Instead of fostering inclusive development, climate policy is increasingly being shaped by protectionist measures and IP regimes that entrench technological monopolies in the Global North. For example, the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism may be billed as a safeguard against carbon leakage; but it also illustrates how climate policy can be used to justify protectionist trade measures. </p>
<p data-line-id="1f2e87891de641b9aebd15b8d84cf63d"> Moreover, China’s recent <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/china-files-wto-complaint-against-india-over-ev-battery-subsidies-urges-new-delhi-to-rectify-wrongdoings/articleshow/124571889.cms">complaint</a> against India for its electric-vehicle and battery subsidies shows how green industrial policies are increasingly becoming grounds for trade disputes. Together, these developments signal a growing tension between climate goals and World Trade Organization rules. Could measures to address climate change soon become a new impetus for economic exclusion? </p>
<p data-line-id="93bf01789124457a821484db8d68aa0b"> At the heart of this issue lies a stark imbalance: larger powers like China, the United States, and the EU are producing high-value green technologies, while most developing countries are stuck exporting low-value green commodities – primarily critical minerals. This mirrors the colonial-era division of labor, whereby the Global South supplied raw materials, and the North supplied innovation, monopolized production, and reaped the largest profits. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="f43bc6c24e0b4c2ba6f23b66033106d0"> Data from the World Intellectual Property Organization <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_econstat_wp_44.pdf">underscore</a> the depth of this divide. Green patents (relating to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation) are overwhelmingly concentrated in a handful of countries, such as China, the US, Japan, and Germany. Between 2000 and 2024, the top ten economies accounted for nearly 90% of international patent filings in solar and wind technologies. Brazil, despite ranking sixth globally in installed wind capacity, contributed only 0.4% of global wind patents. For solar, its share was a mere 0.19%. </p>
<p data-line-id="f2f8211539cf44bcbc6b44ad4cb1fbf2"> This technological concentration is not accidental. It is the result of a global IP regime that privileges monopoly profits over public goods. Efforts to foster more global coordination, including through the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm">Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS) agreement, have failed to address the fundamental problem. </p>
<p data-line-id="b1e4bb04008646e1be5d1989d7171c9c"> Without access to affordable technologies, the Global South cannot fully participate in the climate transition. Worse, the current system risks locking developing countries into a new form of dependency, supplying the minerals for batteries and solar panels but lacking the means to produce them. </p>
<p data-line-id="6274447ec049417381b03bdedf9a4303"> Climate finance is not sufficient to break this cycle. Instead, technology transfers and reforms to the global IP regime must be at the center of climate negotiations. While the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris climate agreement do acknowledge this, little progress has been made. </p>
<p data-line-id="7fae00315285470083be566db1f4ebd8"> Fortunately, there is a precedent for the necessary changes. Back in the 2000s, Brazil played a pivotal role in categorizing access to HIV/AIDS medicines as a public good, rather than as a commodity governed solely by IP rights. This shift was driven by a combination of legal, political, and civil-society actions that challenged the global pharmaceutical patent regime and put public health first. </p>
<p data-line-id="f92fb8141ad549fbb13305c57c33e2a0"> As the Nobel laureate economist <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/joseph-e-stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a> has <a href="https://cgt.columbia.edu/news/stiglitz-wealth-health-intellectual-property-laws-facing-counterattack/">argued</a>, such mechanisms are essential to correct market failures and ensure equitable access to innovation. That is why the International Court of Justice, in its recent <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/187/187-20250723-pre-01-00-en.pdf">advisory opinion</a> on climate change, underscored the obligation of all states to cooperate – beyond the provision of finance – on the development and diffusion of green technologies, including by sharing knowledge and engaging in technology transfers.  </p>
<p data-line-id="3da193e1fd4c43dc88bb2d4b08cc0d5a"> The Technology Implementation Program that was agreed at COP28 offers a means to foster such cooperation. Under Brazil’s leadership at COP30, TIP can become a platform for strengthening national innovation systems, enabling countries to adapt technologies to local contexts and build capacity for climate solutions. The idea is to use a mix of public and private money to support trial projects, and then to scale those that prove effective. </p>
<p data-line-id="a2e001acf81445b5a88da182c39296eb"> For example, we could support a pilot that aims to produce low-carbon fertilizer using green hydrogen. Currently, ammonia – the key input for nitrogen fertilizers – is made using hydrogen from fossil fuels, which is why the sector is responsible for roughly <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/fertiliser-emissions-could-be-cut-to-one-fifth-of-current-levels-by-2050/">1-2% of global carbon dioxide emissions</a>. By replacing fossil-based hydrogen with renewable (green) hydrogen, the same ammonia output would produce far fewer emissions, as well as offering a scalable, locally adaptable solution. If the pilot succeeds in this hard-to-abate sector, it will create a replicable model for other countries. </p>
<p data-line-id="c9b63c1d0a614c9b874d378bffc672cb"> Brazil’s COP30 presidency can rally the Global South behind a vision of TIP that delivers climate justice through innovation. This is not just a technical agenda, but a political one. Only by empowering countries with access to green technologies can they build the capacity they need. And by helping the rest of the world decarbonize, wealthy countries will be helping themselves. </p>

<p data-line-id="c537cbfb8ca049c08b85dea041f8290d"> CAPE TOWN – A growing chorus of Western media outlets, think tanks, and financial commentators is questioning whether Africa’s multilateral financial institutions, such as the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), should retain “preferred creditor status.” Not only are their criticisms misguided; they threaten to erode Africa’s growing financial autonomy and undermine its ability to chart an independent economic course. </p>

<p data-line-id="abde84e9846a46288ce1c8a167a6ff10"> BERLIN/SANTIAGO – AI is often portrayed as the harbinger of a prosperous, more efficient future. But the machines driving this revolution depend on a resource far older – and far more contested – than data or electricity: water. </p><p data-line-id="848284dd839c408fbf35a15a7211d03f"> As the Heinrich Böll Foundation’s recent <a href="https://eu.boell.org/en/WaterAtlas">Water Atlas</a> makes clear, AI’s rapid growth is depleting local water reserves around the world, from drought-stricken Chile to South Africa. Its physical footprint reflects a new form of colonial extraction; instead of silver and soy, now it is the cooling water that keeps the digital economy running. </p><p data-line-id="93706a1868494ca3b99d769fbb7ad78d"> While the debate about AI’s energy use focuses on the power needed to train and operate large language models, what is often overlooked is the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-water-usage">vast amount</a> of water required to cool data centers, not to mention the water used in energy production and hardware manufacturing. </p><p data-line-id="4ad43f25c1174e8d9ec8f9062a0331c9"> ChatGPT is a prime example. Training GPT-3 required <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3724499">roughly 700,000 liters of water</a> for cooling alone. A Greenpeace study <a href="https://www.greenpeace.de/publikationen/20250514-greenpeace-studie-umweltauswirkungen-ki-eng.pdf">estimates</a> that data centers will consume 664 billion liters annually by 2030, compared to 239 billion liters in 2024. </p><p data-line-id="88280c6ae108411aae31356aeec80dd7"> AI’s benefits are concentrated in the Global North, yet its environmental costs increasingly fall on the Global South. In 2023, mass protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/11/uruguay-drought-water-google-data-center">erupted</a> in Uruguay over a proposed Google data center as the country suffered its worst drought in 70 years. With reservoirs running dry, authorities began pumping brackish water from the Río de la Plata estuary into public systems, <a href="https://thelivinglib.org/where-cloud-meets-cement/">granting Google permits</a> to draw from the remaining freshwater reserves even as working-class families boiled salty tap water to drink. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Go beyond the headlines to understand the issues, forces, and trends shaping the US presidential election – and the likely implications of its outcome." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Politics" data-link-name="newsletter-politics" data-newsletter="prosyn-above-the-fold" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="81e2c009287345e4943254bf560325d0"> A similar conflict has unfolded in Chile, one of Latin America’s most drought-prone countries. In Santiago’s Cerrillos district, a proposed Google data center was projected to consume <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#chile">7.6 million liters of water per day</a> – roughly equal to the entire community’s annual use. In response, activists from the local group MOSACAT launched a legal and political campaign that forced a redesign of the cooling system and a new environmental review. </p><p data-line-id="18fff99b83a34f1e8381524749e42914"> These community struggles highlight a familiar pattern in which corporations and governments present data centers as engines of modernization while downplaying their environmental costs. In Mexico’s Querétaro region, where rural and indigenous communities already face severe water scarcity, the problems go far beyond depletion: diesel emissions from backup generators cause air and noise pollution; electronic waste imported from the Global North continues to pile up; and growing demand for land, housing, and electricity is driving up costs and straining local infrastructure. </p><p data-line-id="672c998899f14568a6ea15566fb36c27"> Regulation has done little to slow this expansion or improve environmental standards. While the European Union’s 2024 <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">AI Act</a> mandates transparency on energy demand and computing power, it says nothing about water use. Even the <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en">Energy Efficiency Directive</a>, which requires data centers to report water consumption, applies only to data facilities <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/europes-thirst-for-ai-runs-into-local-water-worries/">within the EU</a>. Moreover, reporting is not the same as reform: efficiency – limited by technology and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2025/02/04/g-s1-46018/ai-deepseek-economics-jevons-paradox">Jevons paradox</a> (which occurs when greater efficiency boosts demand for a resource) – too often distracts from the deeper question of sufficiency. </p><p data-line-id="8abc775c92444977ae7e347d837a6deb"> At the same time, many developing economies compete for tech investment by offering generous tax breaks and fast-tracking environmental permits with minimal oversight. Governments tend to frame this as advancing data sovereignty, but Big Tech ultimately holds the power. Moreover, contrary to official promises, data centers create few jobs, and structural inequalities continue to impede the growth of local AI industries. For example, criticism of Brazil’s data center policy <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/brazil-is-handing-out-generous-incentives-for-data-centers-but-what-it-stands-to-gain-from-it-is-still-unclear/">highlights</a> its focus on attracting large tech firms, while neglecting fair competition for domestic companies. </p><p data-line-id="2fe603369b514eb68828c6bda251248a"> Environmental impact assessments are another weak link. Studies <a href="https://www.themaybe.org/research/data-center-report-where-cloud-meets-cement#ekurhuleni">show</a> they are frequently incomplete, inaccurate, or hidden from public scrutiny. In Chile, regulators approved Google’s project despite unresolved issues concerning groundwater rights. In Mexico, activists spent months fighting for access to water-use documents. And in South Africa and Brazil, companies often negotiate directly with national ministries, bypassing local authorities altogether. </p><p data-line-id="85719541c82b4595b32ad8bb310a4a19"> All of this raises a critical question: Who gets a say when digital growth depends on local water sources? Like its benefits, the risks of AI are unequally distributed. For many Latin American and African communities, opposition to data centers is not a rejection of progress but an effort to redefine it. Their defense of water reserves challenges the fantasy of infinite digital expansion in a world of finite resources. </p><p data-line-id="1a7dec09f17d4f64bc1367deb69c41a8"> The problem isn’t one of innovation but of distribution. Sustainable cooling systems that use recycled water, saline water, and rainwater already exist, and air-based systems and heat recovery can further reduce freshwater use. But companies have little incentive to adopt these alternatives when water is cheap, unregulated, and invisible on balance sheets. Another, deeper problem lies in AI’s very nature: its intensive computing demands ever-greater water consumption. </p><p data-line-id="42a520c220774e0fb03b6c39d438921b"> Addressing these challenges requires reconciling technological ambition with the realities of today’s escalating climate and ecological crises. Otherwise, AI’s unchecked growth risks turning water-stressed regions into <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/sacrifice-zones">sacrifice zones</a>. </p><p data-line-id="fbc94be9424d40caae1b74ec2aaffa8e"> This task – shaping a humane and sustainable technological future – is not one that individuals and communities can accomplish on their own. Political leaders must take urgent steps to democratize decision-making, ensure accountability, and align technological innovation with planetary boundaries. </p>

<p data-line-id="da03fb628d9e424b99c90ce9b13b72b9"> PROVIDENCE/CHARLOTTESVILLE – News media tend to focus on the world’s major powers, because they command more resources by dint of their relatively larger economies, militaries, and energy endowments. But there are costs to such dominance. For example, a single American Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier costs $13 billion, while the F-35 fighter jet costs around $100 million. So, if you can build your military equipment for less than your opponent, you can gain a strategic advantage. </p>

<p data-line-id="e7ab1803d50647a685bdd366cc4d195b"> NEW DELHI – Efforts to mitigate climate change have largely focused on the shift away from fossil fuels in energy production. As a result, most climate-finance assessments have studied the costs of such a transition and determined that large investments are required to deploy cleaner sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="091cd489d9c641a2abe24517e966d170"> But in a new <a href="https://csep.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Finance-Needs-of-Nine-G20-EMEs.pdf">working paper</a>, we found that shifting the energy sector to renewables is relatively affordable for emerging-market economies (EMEs) in the G20. Our study measures the climate-finance needs from 2022 to 2030 of Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power, road transport, cement, and steel sectors, which account for about half of such emissions in these nine EMEs. </p>
<p data-line-id="004fb6b43fef47a0be50a35015e29f63"> For starters, we found that the clean-energy transition is advancing at a steady pace. The power sector accounts for about 27% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in these nine EMEs, which together account for 44% of global power-sector emissions. To meet increasing energy demand and climate targets, these economies have focused on incrementally phasing out the use of fossil fuels in power generation and replacing them with renewables. Between 2023 and 2030, the share of clean energy in their total installed capacity is projected to rise from 54% to 65%, while their total installed capacity of renewables should almost double, from 2,150 gigawatts to 4,220 gigawatts. </p>
<p data-line-id="8e2568bc3e1f4cb0a65e246b81c31bbf"> The largest shifts during this period are expected in India and South Africa, where the share of renewables is set to rise from 45% to 63% and from 25% to 42%, respectively. China is also making significant advances, with its share of renewables projected to increase from 55% to 65%. In seven of these EMEs (excluding Indonesia and South Africa), more than half of the total installed power capacity will come from non-fossil-fuel sources by 2030. </p>
<div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div>
<p data-line-id="31264edcaeec4adfb1bcec3348a2db74"> This is possible because rapid technological developments and China’s massive push into green manufacturing have dramatically lowered the cost of establishing solar and wind farms in recent years. Globally, the cost of installed solar PV and onshore wind <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osgttinf2024d3_en.pdf">decreased</a> by 83% and 42%, respectively, between 2010 and 2022.  </p>
<p data-line-id="97e2f7b3b5cc4dc09fd38dbc8dd3024c"> In addition, the cost of batteries has also <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-can-innovation-help-secure-future-battery-markets-and-mineral-supplies">fallen</a> – by about 90% between 2010 and 2023 – driven by innovation and lower raw-material costs. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity projects are also more affordable now, especially in China and India, owing to favorable topographic conditions, low labor and material costs, and relatively streamlined regulatory and permitting processes. </p>
<p data-line-id="dfe57aa9176344488faebc348e1952de"> Given the falling costs of renewable energy, the G20’s EMEs will need only $121 billion in climate finance for power generation – the amount over and above the investment required in a business-as-usual scenario – between 2024 and 2030. According to our estimates, capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power plants will decline by $156 billion over that period, while spending for clean power will increase by $277 billion. Most notably, India and China will save $43 billion and $52 billion, respectively, on capital expenditure for fossil-fuel-based power sources but will need to increase such spending on renewables by $90 billion and $102 billion, respectively. </p>
<p data-line-id="d2aaa18b4d444bb19b6b5abe891661f9"> Storage costs (both battery and pumped storage) for renewables will likely entail additional capital expenditure of $28 billion for these EMEs, bringing the overall climate finance needed for 2024-30 to $149 billion, or $21 billion annually. Excluding China, the remaining eight EMEs will require $94 billion, or $13 billion annually, in cumulative climate finance (including storage costs) to shift to renewable sources of power. </p>
<p data-line-id="93a15039527c4fcf89b6c8f174dbbc18"> These estimates do not account for the additional costs of adapting electricity grids to cleaner energy sources. Large-scale growth in AI and data centers may also increase energy demand more than envisaged. </p>
<p data-line-id="810deb1c59b84f4eb663923b9ffc0d35"> Of the nine EMEs we studied, India is projected to need the largest amount of climate finance – $57 billion, or 38% of the total estimate – to continue decarbonizing the power sector, while China will require slightly less, around $55 billion, because the increase in renewables’ share of installed capacity is expected to be more pronounced in India than in China. Climate finance as a percentage of GDP will likely be largest in South Africa, at 0.25%, followed by India (0.13%) and Mexico (0.09%). </p>
<p data-line-id="5ac7267a17a14c95bf81571b9a355ce0"> A decade or so ago, a consensus emerged that financing the energy transition would require massive amounts of capital. But, in the intervening years, the cost of renewables has fallen dramatically. Compared to road transport, cement, and steel in the nine EMEs we studied, the power sector will require the least amount of climate finance for the foreseeable future, even after accounting for storage costs and low renewable load factors. Now that decarbonizing the energy system is much more affordable in EMEs, there is no excuse not to do so. </p>

<p data-line-id="b3fbdc63119c4b7fad15bc8c57ab8374"> BRUSSELS – In a face-to-face meeting last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump reached a truce in their countries’ long-running trade war. Trump lowered tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for the rollback of Chinese export controls on rare earths. Many have depicted the deal as a victory for China: by raising the specter of a rare-earth supply shortage, Xi forced the US to make concessions on tariffs. But a closer look at the numbers suggests that China is not the rare-earth juggernaut it might seem to be. </p>

Just ask residents of Spain and Portugal, who were suddenly faced with a total blackout last April, when a series of cascading voltage surges <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7d4vjdlrmo">shut down</a> their electricity grids. Both Spain and Portugal are now pursuing massive investments in strengthening their grids’ resilience. But citizens should not have to wait until after disaster strikes for their leaders to commit to investing in critical infrastructure, which nowadays includes cloud services. </p>

<p data-line-id="cfc5e73178c34b13b0d7379aa178fc2f"> CHICAGO – In a recent <em>Financial </em><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Times </em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f6be08a-fd24-4558-b373-6ada31e18900" target="_blank">commentary</a></span>, US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins argued that, “the SEC should only require companies to supply information under the objective standard of whether a reasonable investor would regard it as important to an investment decision. Rules written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment fail this test – and fail investors.” </p><p data-line-id="981256e5a26845ebb0f2b5d92bfc65f8"> At face value, Atkins’ statement seems unexceptional. But it leaves open a key question: What is material to a firm’s financial performance? Atkins suggests that disclosure should not be driven by “political fads or distorted objectives,” citing the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which expands and standardizes corporate sustainability reporting to improve transparency and comparability of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information. Such disclosures, he argues, “may be socially significant but are not generally financially material.”  </p><p data-line-id="fd2eddf66f2e4ae6b2672ffe904754c1"> But this sounds like wishful thinking. If European regulators think the environment matters and they act on that belief, that materially affects multinational firms’ costs of doing business in Europe. Just last month, a Paris <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f3e072e-d136-4174-ad74-d5bbc14e8a99">court</a> found TotalEnergies had engaged in “misleading commercial practices” by claiming it was “a major actor in the energy transition.” Citing EU legislation that requires green claims to be supported by “objective, publicly available, and verifiable commitments and targets,” the court found the company’s climate pronouncements to be inconsistent with its expanded investments in hydrocarbons. While the fines Total has incurred are small, such fines are likely to be larger in the future – and thus material to investors. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="7282690d004044cc9e4bd8131856e1d2"> Obviously, US regulators today put little weight on companies’ green strategies or the need to disclose them. But if regulators elsewhere care more, such strategies are still material to firms that do business across borders. And since there is a deep divide in the United States between Democrats and Republicans on the merits of ESG policies, a company that avoids ESG-related actions during the current administration might find itself hamstrung in a future one. Shouldn’t investors who value long-run earnings be able to make their own judgments about these issues? Regardless of whether ESG is a political fad (or whether opposition to it is), disclosures of ESG-aligned practices may still be material to the bottom line. </p><p data-line-id="593b688c3d4142ec97f0b630b482b93c"> Nor are regulators the only ones who might care. In the TotalEnergies case, the concern was that customers will be misled by the company’s environmental pronouncements. In a warming world, it is reasonable to expect that some people’s purchasing decisions might well be swayed by a company’s environmental practices.  </p><p data-line-id="88fb40cfaa354cd0b734ba66a975eeac"> Moreover, research <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bbr/a/THJmk5T7WKCKTJgXvT8NnQt">suggests</a> that Brazilian firms with better environmental practices (when certified by regulators) attract more skilled workers and ultimately perform better. Thus, whether environmental practices command universal political appeal is beside the point. If they attract a preferred kind of worker and enhance a firm’s bottom line, the company’s shareholders would want to know about it. </p><p data-line-id="a408f572609444aeb7bc245fca049710"> Atkins does raise a potentially valid concern about the intended audience for corporate disclosures. He opposes rules “written for shareholders who seek to effect social change or have motives unrelated to maximizing the financial return on their investment.” But, again, what if some shareholders are willing to sacrifice returns for socially beneficial practices? Should their preferences be ignored?  </p><p data-line-id="91fb1d0b89804e89a7f0f95e6a4ff7e8"> The argument for focusing solely on financial returns has always been that, by doing so, the firm empowers minority investors to go and spend their enhanced share of wealth on whatever social or political cause they prefer. The company does not need to cater to their whims to empower them. Yet Oliver Hart of Harvard and <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/luigi-zingales">Luigi Zingales</a> of the University of Chicago make a <a href="https://hart.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/companies-should-maximize-shareholder-welfare-not-market-value">compelling argument</a> that shareholders may prefer that the company act directly on their concerns. The shareholder-value argument suggests that a firm should continue to pollute the environment to maximize profits and its share price, because its environmentally conscious shareholders can then use some of their enhanced wealth to fund a clean-up. But the problem with this view should be obvious: Environmental remediation tends to be much more costly than preventing pollution in the first place, so shareholders and society alike would be better off if the firm sacrificed some profits to follow cleaner practices. </p><p data-line-id="b3c15f1081734448881a0cbc8dd8e687"> Put differently, the SEC cannot simply dismiss socially motivated investors as a nuisance, because this cohort may form the majority in some firms, and their interests may not be served if the firm simply maximizes profits. In a world where investors are inundated with information, the SEC is right to ask what is and is not material. Mandatory SEC disclosures are valuable insofar as the information is more reliable than anything that is voluntarily disclosed. Since disclosure does impose a burden on firms, it should be mandated judiciously.  </p><p data-line-id="36dcc4f6e94a4239b6bfaa2bc60f4ccf"> But the SEC must recognize that a wide variety of interests look at such disclosures, and that their effects are material. To dismiss these concerns as political is to engage in politicization oneself. It is better to recognize that there are many channels through which disclosure can affect investors and society, and then make the necessary tradeoffs in SEC mandates. </p>

<p data-line-id="3dd3917fa757457eb435f061c4db58f6"> BEIJING – According to US President Donald Trump, his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping – the first of his second term – was “amazing.” Trump may have campaigned on the promise of squeezing America’s biggest geopolitical competitor, but that is not what has happened. Instead, top Chinese academics and retired military leaders whom I spoke to in Beijing this week all agree that Xi’s international strategy has been vindicated, and that an increasingly fractured multipolar world is working very much to China’s advantage. </p>

<p data-line-id="4caba402b0b54bfb8d1dec0391743b73"> NEW YORK – Heading into Argentina’s legislative elections this month, commentary about the country’s economic and financial prospects was growing increasingly pessimistic. With a significant amount of foreign debt coming due next year, the conventional wisdom was that an exchange-rate-based stabilization program – letting the currency depreciate by less than the inflation rate to push inflation down – had led to a massively overvalued currency and an external deficit that was bound to precipitate a crisis. But having written a <a href="https://www.piie.com/bookstore/bailouts-or-bail-ins-responding-financial-crises-emerging-economies">book</a> on currency crises in emerging markets, and having followed Argentine policies closely, I thought this consensus was far off the mark.  </p>

sets out the priorities for this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil.        </p>

<p data-line-id="e330e3f2b09b45f0be2ccd549926c8c4"> DHAKA – This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil (COP30) comes at a decisive moment, not just for the climate agenda but for international cooperation more broadly. Following last year’s “finance COP” in Baku – where countries agreed to <a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop29-un-climate-conference-agrees-to-triple-finance-to-developing-countries-protecting-lives-and">triple</a> the global target for climate finance – this year’s gathering is being framed as the “implementation COP.” </p><p data-line-id="f37e51257a9c4571b316868bf05bdcd3"> After years of negotiations, the time for ambitious commitments has passed. We now need concrete action. That means actually mobilizing climate finance, not as an act of charity, but as a strategic investment in global resilience, shared prosperity, and mutual security. </p><p data-line-id="68972c57aa1f4a5ea8080ac27bb8c96c"> Developing countries are not coming to the table empty-handed. We are bringing ambitious climate plans, national commitments, and domestic financing of our own. Bangladesh, for example, draws 75% of its climate finance from its own resources, and allocates 6-7% of its annual budget to climate-related efforts. </p><p data-line-id="6c5918510ac743f5a8d049791b30a022"> Many developing countries are also submitting updated Nationally Determined Contributions (the Paris climate agreement’s term for emissions-reduction plans), strengthening their policy frameworks, and pioneering locally driven solutions that can inform global best practices. Thus, Bangladesh recently submitted its “NDC 3.0,” which sets an unconditional emissions-reduction target of 6.39% by 2035 (in the business-as-usual scenario), and a conditional target of 13.92%. </p><p data-line-id="555cb46b72d84ed7afe7e4fcfccbb479"> But the total investment required to implement our NDC is a staggering $116 billion. That is why we have also created the Bangladesh Climate and Development Platform (BCDP), a nationally owned mechanism designed to scale up climate finance and integrate national climate strategies. With strong political support, the BCDP brings together more than ten ministries, marking a significant milestone in coordinated, country-led climate action. </p><div data-classes="newsletter--bg newsletter--yellow newsletter--branding newsletter--compact newsletter--label newsletter--admin" data-consent="true" data-description="Every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance." data-label="Sign up for our weekly newsletter, PS Economics" data-link-name="newsletter-economics" data-newsletter="prosyn-economics-newsletter" data-newsletter-subscribe-form="true"></div><p data-line-id="9b50a3449c3f4c2ba828670dbdc847cc"> As a coastal country, Bangladesh is home to some of the world’s most fragile ecosystems, including the Sundarbans mangrove forest and the world’s largest river delta. These ecosystems provide essential services such as climate regulation, carbon sequestration, and disaster-risk reduction. Protecting them is vital not only for Bangladesh, but for the planet. Doing so, however, requires international support. </p><p data-line-id="d83849951dbe4e62a7585395c08d378c"> The same message applies across the Global South. While developing countries are stepping up, their plans require external support. The COP29 commitment to mobilize $300 billion per year in international climate finance, starting next year, must be the baseline. This figure still represents only a small fraction of what is needed, and we still need to ensure that financing is managed with a higher level of accountability. Developed countries must be held to their commitments, so that new funding is truly additional, rather than being repurposed from existing development aid. </p><p data-line-id="b350c2724a884f28b87ed23a37ede956"> Another priority concerns the quality of financing, which must be well structured, accessible, and effective. That means clarifying how much each developed country will contribute; how resources will be balanced between mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage; and how delivery will be made predictable and fair. </p><p data-line-id="a2a536755c154e898bf2cb7028382e15"> Loans that push developing countries further into debt are not sustainable. A much larger share of finance must come in the form of grants and highly concessional flows. The world cannot build climate resilience on the back of fiscal instability. This was already a recurring theme in Baku, and now COP30 gives us a chance to translate it into a clear policy framework. </p><p data-line-id="cef703dacdaa485bb50c1aa2b1db997a"> Climate finance is sound economics, representing opportunity, not just obligation. Studies <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-adaptation-investment-case">show</a> that every $1 invested in adaptation can generate more than $10 in long-term benefits. For developed countries, supporting adaptation and resilience abroad helps stabilize supply chains, reduce disaster risks, and prevent future crises that will spill over borders. </p><p data-line-id="d7e35d48c3064f418714baf3a28e9bd2"> At the same time, developing countries hold vast, often untapped, potential to drive the global energy transition, safeguard food systems, and power sustainable growth. Bangladesh, for example, is the world’s <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2025/06/09/reinventing-rice-as-countries-cultivate-change">third-largest</a> rice producer. Helping us achieve resilience against climate shocks is critical for domestic and global food security. We also contribute to global value chains through seafood, textiles, and a dynamic, skilled workforce. With young people comprising <a href="http://thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/youths-account-28pc-population-3293161">28%</a> of our population, we have the potential to be a key partner in many growth industries of the future. </p><p data-line-id="a4ea33f39bc34ad3a9a35938c7e19b62"> As an investment in our shared future, climate finance requires partnerships that will benefit everyone – economically, socially, and environmentally. But merely increasing our financing targets is not enough. Last year, developing countries engaged in good faith to reach an agreement on climate finance, even though the outcome did not fully reflect our needs. That commitment to dialogue must now be matched by a commitment to clarity and delivery. We need all countries to engage constructively in shaping the structure of climate finance. The question is not just how much, but how it flows, and how it can best be used to drive long-term transformations. </p><p data-line-id="e29b52fa264040219ef39c207cb165f7"> Already, Brazil and Azerbaijan are co-leading efforts to build a roadmap to scale climate finance to <a href="https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/workstreams/baku-to-belem-roadmap-to-13t">$1.3 trillion</a> annually by 2035. But we cannot reach that goal without laying the foundation for it. That means delivering the promised $300 billion per year through mechanisms that are transparent, fair, and effective. </p><p data-line-id="b371b9ba379d48fbadd047ce34f5bb72"> With multilateralism in crisis, we must restore faith in the process. Multilateralism has delivered before, and it can do so again. COP30 is where we can prove that the international system is capable of moving from commitment to implementation, and from division to cooperation. We have the tools, and we have the knowledge. What we need now is the will to turn climate finance into a shared engine for growth, security, and a fairer future. </p>
