        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Expressions Using Our Head and Shoulders (2024/10/20)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/expressions-using-our-head-and-shoulders.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">19 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Many English expressions and <strong>idioms</strong> use parts of the body to describe things unrelated to the body. For example, a <u>green thumb</u> means to be good at growing vegetables, flowers and other plants. And if something <u>costs an arm and a leg</u>, it is very <strong>expensive</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, today, we talk about your shoulder. This part connects your arm to your body. And the shoulder finds its way into many expressions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Sheet Metal Union member Dan Hines carries Jackson Kin on his shoulders as he and Erica Kin march in the annual Labor Day Parade in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., September 2, 2024. (REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/aa66a232-63ee-45a7-a983-5aad0b4303ed_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Sheet Metal Union member Dan Hines carries Jackson Kin on his shoulders as he and Erica Kin march in the annual Labor Day Parade in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., September 2, 2024. (REUTERS/Rebecca Cook)</span></div>
<p>For starters, let's talk about “shoulder” as a verb. If you <u>shoulder</u> something, you accept it as your responsibility; you give support, or you take the blame.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>Since he was the leader of the project, he <u>shouldered</u> the blame for its failure.</em></p>
<p>And this is a great place to start. This idea of taking responsibility and giving support leads us to some other “shoulder” expressions.</p>
<p>For example, during difficult times in our lives, it is often necessary to have <u>a shoulder to <strong>lean</strong> <strong>on</strong></u> or <u>a shoulder to cry on</u>.</p>
<p>When we <u>lean on someone's shoulder</u>, we ask for their help. When we <u>cry on someone's shoulder</u>, they are there for support.</p>
<p>It is important to have at least one friend who has <u>a good shoulder to cry on</u>. These friends are great because they don't ask questions. They just listen and let us cry. You can also <u>put your head on someone's shoulder</u>. This means you are getting comfort and support from that person.</p>
<p>We call people who give us <u>a shoulder to lean on</u> or <u>cry on</u> our “support system.”</p>
<p>There is another way our shoulders give us support. If you are successful in your career but others have come before you, you can say you are <u>standing on the shoulders of <strong>giants</strong></u>. This means you have not succeeded on your own. You have learned from others in the same field who had earlier successes.</p>
<p>This expression is often used in science. This is an area where discoveries are often built upon the works of others. Because this expression uses the word “giant,” we often use it when talking about very well-known people. For example, in the world of science, the giants may include Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>Now, from our shoulders, let's move up to our heads. Our heads are centered between our shoulders. So, it should not be surprising that we have a couple of expressions that use both.</p>
<p>If you have <u>a good head on your shoulders,</u> you are thoughtful and smart. You do the right thing, and people can count on you. When you have <u>a good head on your shoulders</u>, you often achieve success in life.</p>
<p>This quality, people say, often puts you <u>head and shoulders above the rest</u>. This means you are much better than those in a similar field or competition.</p>
<p>Let's here it used in an example:</p>
<p><em>You have <strong>applied</strong> for a job. You have more education and much more experience than the job requires. You also have special skills that make you even more desirable. You feel these <strong>factors</strong> put you <u>head and shoulders above</u> the other candidates.</em></p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<p><em>You are preparing to run in a race. You have clocked the fastest time, and you have trained more than all the other runners. That certainly makes you <u>head and shoulders above</u> the rest.</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Legal and Law (2024/10/19)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/legal-and-law.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/><span class="datetime">18 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Emmanuel in Zambia about the usage of the words “legal” and “law” in English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/305dd1b7-d570-4785-8ec9-90bab77ef68b_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>Please help me understand the correct usage of the words "legal" and "law.” In the recent debate... I heard Donald Trump say "legal scholar.” I thought he was supposed to say, "law scholar.” Which one is the correct usage?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Emmanuel.</p>
<p>The word “legal” is an adjective. That is why we can place it before the noun “scholar.” In the same way, we can use “legal” before many other nouns, as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>Legal system, legal documents, legal protections, </em>and <em>legal opinion.</em></p>
<p>The word “law” is a noun. We often use “the law” to discuss <strong>specific</strong> laws or to discuss the law in general. Let's look at an example of each. First, here is an example discussing a specific law about voting rules:</p>
<p><em>The law clearly states that persons under 18 years old are not permitted to vote.</em></p>
<p>Next, here is an example discussing the law in general:</p>
<p><em>Over the years, the law has changed to provide equal rights to women.</em></p>
<p><strong>Law: noun or adjective?</strong></p>
<p>The noun “law” can seem like an adjective when we place it before another noun to describe what a person does. For example:</p>
<p><em>Law professor, law school,</em> and <em>law student</em></p>
<p>However, the word “law” and the noun together form what is called a spaced compound noun. That is, we use the two words together to name one thing or person. “Police officer” is another example of a compound noun.</p>
<p>But this returns us to your question—if we can say “law professor,” why do we usually say “legal scholar” instead of “law scholar?”</p>
<p>One reason is that when we state what kind of legal scholar a person is, we can use an adjective and the word “law” before the word “scholar.” The following examples show this.</p>
<p><em>A busy law scholar</em></p>
<p><em>A constitutional law scholar</em></p>
<p>In these cases, the word “law” replaces the word “legal.” But if we are not stating what kind of scholar a person is, then we usually use the two words “legal scholar.”</p>
<p>Note, however, that we can also put an adjective before the words “legal scholar,” as in “international legal scholar.”</p>
<p>The above examples show that there are no strict rules for using “legal scholar” instead of “law scholar” when an adjective is placed before the two words. But keep in mind that we use the expression “legal scholar” more often than "law scholar” when there is no adjective before the two words.</p>
<p>Discussing the law and legal terms in English might seem difficult. But by reading and listening carefully, you can find the most common and correct ways to discuss this subject.</p>
<p>For our readers and listeners, what are your questions about American English? We'd like to hear from you. Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="21voa.com">21voa.com</a>. And please include where you are from in your email, too.</p>

            <title>Huge Egyptian Museum Opens for Test Run (2024/10/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">17 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The <strong>Grand </strong>Egyptian Museum in Giza will open a limited number of <strong>exhibits </strong>about ancient Egypt starting this week. The limited opening will be a test run of the still-unannounced official opening of the museum, officials said.</p>
<p>Starting on October 16, 4,000 visitors per day will be permitted to view limited areas of the main <strong>galleries</strong>, said Al-Tayeb Abbas. He is assistant to Egypt's minister of <strong>antiquities</strong>.</p>
<p>Museum officials have repeatedly delayed the museum opening for many reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Some areas have been open since 2022 for limited <strong>tours.</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="King Ramses II statue is displayed at the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, Egypt, Tuesday, Oct.15, 2024.

(AP Photo/Khaled Elfiqi)</span></div>
<p>The museum is a huge project near the famous Giza Pyramids. The building project began more than 12 years ago and has cost more than $1 billion so far.</p>
<p>The Egyptian government says more than 100,000 <strong>artifacts</strong> of Egypt's ancient treasures are on show at the site. Officials describe it as the world's largest archaeological museum.</p>
<p>The exhibits in the test run include 12 areas that explore issues related to society, religion, and philosophies of ancient Egypt, Abbas added. The areas are divided by <strong>dynasty</strong> and historical order.</p>
<p>Historical divisions include the Third Intermediate Period, Late Period, and Graeco-Roman Period. It also includes the New Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and Old Kingdom periods. They all represent life thousands of years in the past.</p>
<p>One of the areas displays statues of the “Elite of the King.” These represent members of a king's family, and high-level officials who worked in the army, government or religious service.</p>
<p>Abbas told the AP that the test run would help prepare for the full opening by identifying operational issues. This includes finding out which parts of the museum might become overcrowded.</p>
<p>A reporter for the Associated Press spoke with some tourists at the museum.</p>
<p>Canadian visitor Aude Porcedda told the AP she was <strong>amazed</strong> by the museum. She said she believes it is important that the world know about Egyptian civilization.</p>
<p>Jorge Licano, a visitor from Costa Rica expressed similar praise.</p>
<p>“There is a lot of history and a lot of things we are not aware of, especially coming from the other side of the world, and seeing everything here and learning from the locals has been great,” he said.</p>
<p>The limited opening includes the museum's so-called Grand<strong> </strong>Staircase. It is six stories high with a view of the nearby pyramids. Also open to the public, are artifacts that include <strong>sarcophagi</strong> and statues. Other parts of the museum, including the King Tutankhamun treasure collection, are set to open at later dates.</p>
<p>All the exhibit space is equipped with high-level technology and permit different kinds of media presentations to help explain the lives of ancient Egyptians, including kings, said museum official, Eissa Zidan.</p>
<p>Some exhibits will use virtual reality to explain the history of burial and its development throughout ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>“The museum is not only a place to display antiquities, but it also aims to attract children to learn about ancient Egyptian history ... The museum is a gift to all the world,” Zidan told the AP.</p>

            <title>Unlicensed Gold Mines in Ghana Present Risks to People, Nature (2024/10/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">17 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p class="Body">Illegal gold mining operations in Ghana have reportedly increased in recent years. The activities present dangerous risks to the individuals involved as well as environmental harms. The Reuters news agency recently reported on the issue.</p>
<p class="Body">Reporters with the news agency visited such an operation in western Ghana. They found that workers were not using professional protective equipment as they mined for gold in muddy water filled with mercury. Groups of unofficial miners wore normal clothes and used only their hands to remove rocks.</p>
<p class="Body">The <strong>unlicensed</strong> mine is in the country's Prestea-Huni Valley district. It is an example of how increasing numbers of people are turning to illegal methods to find gold to earn money.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A drone view shows the excavated pits for illegal mining at the Prestea-Huni Valley Municipal District in the Western Region, Ghana August 17, 2024. (REUTERS/Francis Kokoroko)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/295e7358-0906-47ae-9c48-c5d29e6f1046_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A drone view shows the excavated pits for illegal mining at the Prestea-Huni Valley Municipal District in the Western Region, Ghana August 17, 2024. (REUTERS/Francis Kokoroko)</span></div>
<p class="Body">Mining officials in Ghana say such operations can harm miners' health, pollute waterways, destroy forests and farms, and increase crime rates.</p>
<p class="Body">One of the men working at the illegal mine told Reuters, “It's risky, but I just want to survive.” The man was a 24-year-old accounting student. He did not want to be named because he is involved in illegal activities. He told Reuters he had been missing classes to search for gold because he needs the money.</p>
<p class="Body">The unlicensed gold mining industry is known in Ghana as "galamsey.” The industry has grown quickly over the past year. One reason for the growth was a 30 percent rise in international gold prices.</p>
<p class="Body">Small mines produced 34 million grams of gold in the first seven months of this year, official government records show. That was more than in all of 2023.</p>
<p class="Body">About 40 percent of Ghana's total gold comes from small mines — those not owned by large international companies. And an estimated 70-80 percent of the small mines are unlicensed.</p>
<p class="Body">News reports and human rights groups say numerous miners have died from collapsing <strong>pits</strong> in recent years. Hospitals and health centers have reported high numbers of early deaths from heart-related diseases of miners and people living in towns and villages near mines.</p>
<p class="Body">The health problems are linked to breathing in dust that contains heavy metals such as lead. In addition, poisonous gas from the mercury and nitric acid are released during unlicensed mine activities. Such chemicals are also dumped on the ground or in rivers.

            <title>Fossil Discovery in Brazil Could Help Explain Rise of Dinosaurs (2024/10/17)</title>

<p>Scientists in Brazil recently announced the discovery of one of the world's oldest reptile remains. They say the bones – dating back to around 237 million years ago – may help explain the rise of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The four-legged reptile species is called Gondwanax paraisensis, researchers recently announced in a statement. The animal is believed to have been near the size of a small dog, with a long tail.</p>
<p>The small reptile would have lived in the Triassic Period on land which is today southern Brazil. During this period – from 252 million to 201 million years ago – the world was much hotter.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Paleontologist from the Federal University of Santa Maria, Rodrigo Temp Muller, analyzes fossils called Gondwanax paraisensis, a species that lived 237 million years ago in Sao Joao do Polesine, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, October 8, 2024.

<p>The <strong>fossil </strong>was identified as a new silesaurid, a group of reptiles believed to have died off in a mass <strong>extinction</strong> event. Experts have debated whether silesaurids were true dinosaurs or if they came before dinosaurs.</p>
<p>"Understanding the <strong>characteristics</strong> of these <strong>precursors</strong> could shed light on what was crucial for the dinosaurs' evolutionary success," a statement from the researchers said.</p>
<p>In 2014, Pedro Lucas Porcela Aurelio, a medical doctor, found the remains in a piece of rock in the town of Paraiso do Sul. The town sits in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
<p>The Gondwanax paraisensis<strong> fossil</strong> comes from a time when dinosaurs as well as mammals, crocodiles, turtles and frogs first appeared.</p>
<p>Aurelio gave the remains to a local university in 2021, beginning three years of research.</p>
<p>"Being the first human to touch something from 237 million years ago is <strong>extraordinary</strong>," Aurelio told Reuters. "It's an indescribable feeling."</p>
<p>The research was led by Brazilian scientist Rodrigo Temp Müller, a paleontologist. His findings recently appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X24002764?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">in an article</a> in the publication <em>Gondwana Research</em>.</p>
<p>Müller said, "The most important part of this finding is its age. Because it's so old, it gives us clues as to how dinosaurs came to be."</p>
<p>Müller added that when Aurelio gave researchers the remains, they were covered by a thick layer of rock. At first, only parts of the backbone could be seen.</p>
<p>Gondwanax means "lord of Gondwana." The name suggests the Gondwana landmass in the southern area of the supercontinent Pangaea. Pangaea later broke apart into continents. The name paraisensis honors the town of Paraiso do Sul.</p>

            <title>Scientists Recreate Head of Largest Ancient Bug (2024/10/17)</title>

<p>The largest bug to ever live was about 2.6 meters long and had many legs. However, the look and shape of its head remained a mystery until now.</p>
<p>The <strong>fossils</strong> of these creatures are often headless shells. When bugs drop their shells, a process called shedding, they move out of the head opening, leaving behind their <strong>exoskeleton</strong> but very little of the head.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists solved that mystery by re-creating the creature's head. They were able to do this after studying complete and well-kept fossils of younger bugs. The researchers published the new findings on October 10 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration provided by researchers shows a young Arthropleura insect recreated using fossils discovered in Montceau-les-Mines, France.

<p>What did the heads look like?</p>
<p>The huge bug's head was round with two short bell-shaped <strong>antennae. </strong>It had<strong> </strong>two eyes that stuck out like crab's eyes. Its mouth was fairly small and made for eating leaves and the outer covering of trees.</p>
<p>Its name is Arthropleura. This bug belonged to a group of crabs, spiders and insects called arthropods. But the bug was much, much bigger. It could grow as big as 2.6 meters and weigh as much as 50 kilograms.</p>
<p>The co-writer of the study is Mickael Lheritier. He is a <strong>paleobiologist</strong> at the University Claude Bernard Lyon in Villeurbanne, France. He said, “We discovered that it had the body of a millipede, but head of a centipede."</p>
<p>This large Arthropleura may have been the biggest bug to ever live. Although, not all scientists agree. Some say Arthropleura may be a close second to an <strong>extinct</strong> giant sea scorpion.</p>
<p>Researchers in Europe and North America have been collecting pieces and footprints of the huge bugs since the late 1800s.</p>
<p>“We have been wanting to see what the head of this animal looked like for a really long time,” said James Lamsdell. He is a paleobiologist at West Virginia University and was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>To produce a model<strong> </strong>of the head, researchers first used <strong>CT scans</strong> to study full-body fossils of younger bugs. These fossils were found in a French coal field in the 1980s.</p>
<p>This method permitted researchers to look closely for “hidden details like <strong>bits</strong> of the head” still in the rock without hurting the fossil, Lamsdell said.</p>
<p>The fossils are easily broken. He added that when you dig in the rock to remove the fossil, you do not know what part of the fossil “may have been lost or damaged.”</p>
<p>The fossils of younger bugs only measured about 6 centimeters. And it is possible they were a kind of Arthropleura that did not grow to a really large size.</p>
<p>But still, researchers said they are close enough to the huge Arthropleura to provide a picture of what adults looked like when they were alive 300 million years ago.</p>

<p class="Body">SpaceX has successfully completed a fifth test of its Starship rocket system. The uncrewed test was carried out Sunday at the American space company's launch center in Boca Chica, Texas.</p>
<p class="Body">During the flight, the 121-meter-tall Starship was successfully pushed into space by a SpaceX Super Heavy <strong>booster</strong> rocket. After reaching a height, or altitude, of about 70 kilometers, the booster separated from Starship's second stage, or top half,<strong> </strong>as planned.</p>
<p class="Body">The reuseable booster was then directed by ground controllers to return to the launch center. Before touching down on the landing <strong>pad</strong>, the rocket re-lit three of its 33 Raptor engines in order to slow the booster for a controlled landing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by SpaceX shows SpaceX's mega rocket booster returning to the launch pad to be captured during a test flight Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, in Boca Chica, Texas.

(SpaceX via AP)</span></div>
<p class="Body">The Super Heavy then positioned itself to land. For the first time, the booster was "caught“ and secured in place by a huge structure that includes large metal arms. Video of the landing provided by SpaceX showed the booster rocket being captured by the structure exactly as planned.</p>
<p class="Body">A short time later, Starship's second stage safely <strong>spashed down</strong> in the Indian Ocean. The test flight and successful landings demonstrated progress for SpaceX's Starship system.</p>
<p class="Body">The American space agency NASA is planning to use Starship to carry the next U.S. astronauts to the moon. Such a landing would be the first since NASA's Apollo 17 mission in 1972.</p>
<p class="Body">The next planned moon landing – which NASA officials have set for September 2026 – is part of NASA's Artemis program. Artemis will also seek to establish a permanent base around the moon to support ongoing lunar visits and possible future trips to Mars.</p>

<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p class="Body">SpaceX was chosen to lead NASA's planned moon landing after numerous successful demonstrations and missions in recent years. The company's rockets and spacecraft have been dependably transporting astronauts and materials to the International Space Station (ISS) since 2020.</p>
<p class="Body">NASA also chose American aerospace company Boeing to serve as a possible partner in its Artemis program. But the company's Starliner rocket has faced major delays and difficulties during past test flights.</p>
<p class="Body">In the last one, Starliner successfully transported two American astronauts – Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams – to the ISS in early June. The two were expected to stay in space for only a week. But ongoing technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft prevented a return trip.</p>
<p class="Body">NASA recently decided to have Starliner return to Earth without the astronauts. The plan is for Wilmore and Williams to return home from the ISS in February on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.</p>
<p class="Body">Before SpaceX's latest mission, several Starship rockets exploded during the test flights. The last non-exploding test happened in June. During that flight, SpaceX reported some damage to heat-resisting <strong>tiles</strong> on the outside of Starship. But improvements made since then appeared to have succeeded.</p>
<p class="Body">After Sunday's flight, SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the rockets appeared to be generally in good condition, with just minor <strong>warping </strong>of some outer engine parts from intense heat. He noted that those parts could be fixed easily.</p>
<p class="Body">Musk is also chief of the social media service X. On the service, he expressed excitement when the Starship booster rocket returned to the launch area and was “caught” by the structure. SpaceX calls the huge metal arms that capture and secure the booster rocket on land “<strong>chopsticks</strong>” because they move similarly to the eating instruments.</p>
<p class="Body">“The <strong>tower</strong> has caught the rocket!!” Musk wrote <a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1845446365717156265">in a message</a> on X. “Big step towards making life multiplanetary was made today,” he added.</p>
<p class="Body">The successful test flight was also praised on X by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “Congratulations to @SpaceX on its successful booster catch and fifth Starship flight test today!” Nelson wrote. He added that “continued testing” will prepare NASA and its partners for a series of “<strong>bold</strong> missions” to come in the future.</p>

<p>Early education expert Dan Gartrell says the most important civics lesson that preschools can teach is “social democracy.”</p>
<p>Gartrell wrote a book about teaching democracy to preschoolers. It is called <em>Education for a Civil Society</em>. The book is used by the ACCA Child Development Center near Washington, D.C. in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>Gartrell said this teaching “starts with <strong>appreciating</strong> each member of the group as a <strong>worthy</strong> member and worthy of expressing thoughts and ideas.” He said after that, children can learn to treat others with kindness to solve conflicts and negotiate difficult situations by using words that do not hurt other people's feelings.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Preschool Executive Director Maria Isabel Ballivian, right, listens to her students on what characters of the TV show PAW Patrol they will vote for at the ACCA Child Development Center on Sept. 19, 2024, in Annandale, Virginia.

<p>Rachel Robertson is chief academic officer for Bright Horizons. The company operates preschool centers around the world. It uses democratic ideas in its education.</p>
<p>Robertson said that a child starts to be a “real community member” at around age three or four. She said the child starts “<strong>contributing</strong> to the classroom community and thinking a little bit broader about the world.”</p>
<p>At ACCA in Virginia, children are given a lot of <strong>autonomy</strong>. There are hours spent doing free play. Children vote on what they study and eat.</p>
<p>On a recent day, one classroom had just finished studying sand because the children wanted to know about it after they visited beaches over the summer. The children also tried different apples and voted on which apples the school should order.</p>
<p>The ACCA said the decision-making process is meant to <strong>affirm</strong> to children that their thoughts and the thoughts of their classmates are valuable.</p>
<p>Reporters with the Associated Press recently visited an ACCA classroom. The reporters found the children taking a vote on who the best <strong>character</strong> was on <em>Paw Patrol</em>, an <strong>animated</strong> TV series.</p>
<p>The three- and four-year-old children were choosing between two finalists: a German shepherd named Chase who wears a police uniform, and Skye, who wears a pink “pup pack.”</p>
<p>Educators at ACCA say they are teaching ideas of civics to students early. Their goal, they say, is to raise good citizens and strengthen democracy.</p>
<p>The students are not learning about the structure and rules of government. But teachers say they are working with students on how to solve problems with classmates, how to deal with anger or disappointment and how to think of the needs of others.</p>
<p>Mary Folks is a teacher at ACCA. She said, “We're all here to help develop these children to become better citizens...to be better problem-solvers and to be better equipped socially, emotionally...”</p>
<p>María-Isabel Ballivian is the preschool's executive director. She said she looks for ways to remind students that they are American. For example, she holds a large Fourth of July gathering.</p>
<p>Ballivian said, “If we give them now a sense of belonging, that's going to be a tool that they will have to become <strong>resilient</strong> once they face discrimination.”</p>
<p>Ballivian added, “I don't see how we can change the adults...But I do know, if we work hard, we can prepare our children for a better future.”</p>
<p>As for the class vote at ACCA, they narrowly supported Skye in their vote for best <em>Paw Patrol</em> character.</p>

<p>Takosangba Pongen could see until he was 14 years old. He has been blind for the 13 years since.</p>
<p>But, nobody would know that by watching Pongen perform on the piano.</p>
<p>Pongen said playing the piano helped him after he lost his sight. “It opened a window to see the world. It gives me energy and hope to go forward,” he said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Takosangba Pongen, 27, a blind pianist, rehearses during the two-day Brillante Piano Festival in Bengaluru, India, Sunday, Sept. 29, 2024.

(AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi) </span></div>
<p>Recently, he performed at the Brillante Piano Festival in Bengaluru, the capital of the southern Indian state of Karnataka.</p>
<p>Pongen plays by ear. He taught himself to play, assisted by piano play training on YouTube that he began using in 2020. He said he would like to be a professional musician someday.</p>
<p>But he is having difficulty finding a place that teaches piano to people with sight, or vision, problems.</p>
<p>Pongen first noticed his vision problems at school. He could not see clearly enough to read words on the<strong> blackboard </strong>in the room.</p>
<p>Then he remembers having difficulty seeing the small, glass balls called marbles that he liked to play with.</p>
<p>A medical operation to treat the problem failed, worsening his vision. By 14, Pongen was blind.</p>
<p>Pongen says that he sometimes wishes he could see but adds that he also accepts his condition as “God's plan.” He believes he is meant to serve as a model in how to face difficulty, lending support to others through example.</p>
<p>"If a blind man can do it, why can't others who are fully able,” Pongen said.</p>
<p>Brillante organizers said they believe in the “power of music as an agent of social development.” Pongen is a part of their “Specially Abled Musicians” program.</p>
<p>He played Nocturne in B Flat Minor, a work written by Frederic Chopin. Pongen said Chopin is one of his favorite writers of music.</p>
<p>“I love music that is expressive and emotional,” he said.</p>
<p>Pongen came more than 3,000 kilometers to Bengaluru. He traveled with his sister, Imlibenla, by his side to play at Brillante Festival, the fifth of its kind. His heart was racing, he said, when the program director, Khyochano TCK, presented him to the other musicians.</p>
<p>The nervousness returned as his performance time arrived. Pongen said he took a deep breath to calm himself.</p>
<p>Then, Imlibenla gently guided him onto the stage. She helped to seat him in front of the piano.</p>
<p>From there, he played beautifully.</p>

<p>The Nobel Committee has brought attention to worldwide inequalities by awarding its economic prize to three Americans: Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson.</p>
<p>The Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three won the 2024 Nobel Economics Prize “for studies of how <strong>institutions</strong> are formed and affect <strong>prosperity</strong>.”</p>
<p>Committee chair Jakob Svensson said, “Reducing the <strong>vast</strong> differences in income between countries is one of our time's greatest challenges.” He added that their research has provided “a much deeper understanding of the root causes of why countries fail or succeed.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announces the Nobel Prize in economics, which goes to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson, in Stockholm, Sweden, October 14, 2024.

<p>The wealthiest 20 percent of the world's countries are now around 30 times richer than the poorest 20 percent, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted. The difference continues although poor countries have become relatively richer.</p>
<p>In 2021, the World Inequality Report said that the poorest half of the world's population owned just two percent of wealth while the richest 10 percent controlled 76 percent of wealth.</p>
<p>Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Robinson conducts his research at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Their findings are included in the 2012 book <em>Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty </em>written by Acemoglu and Robinson.</p>
<p>In their work, the winners studied the city of Nogales, which sits on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Despite sharing the same geography, climate, many of the same ancestors and a common culture, life is different on either side of the border. In Nogales, Arizona, to the north, people are relatively wealthy and live long lives; most children complete high school. To the south, in Mexico's Nogales, Sonora, people are much poorer, and the city suffers from organized crime and corruption.</p>
<p>The difference, the economists said, is a U.S. system that protects property rights and gives citizens a say in their government.</p>
<p>The book includes evidence from ancient Rome to modern-day Nogales. It says that “inclusive institutions” make countries richer. It also says democracy, the rule of law and the protection of property rights prevent a small ruling class from owning most resources and wealth.</p>
<p>Reached by the academy in Athens, Greece, the Turkish-born Acemoglu said he was surprised and shocked by the award. He said the research honored by the prize underscores the value of democratic institutions.</p>
<p>“I think broadly speaking the work that we have done favors democracy,” he noted.</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the prize in memory of Alfred Nobel. The prize was established after Nobel's death.</p>

            <title>Scientists Map Fruit Fly Brain to Learn Its Functions (2024/10/15)</title>

<p>A group of international scientists recently announced they had made a map of the whole “brain” of an adult fruit fly.</p>
<p>They said the <strong>milestone</strong> would provide new knowledge about the brains of all animals including humans.</p>
<p>The research gives details of more than 50 million connections between 139,000 neurons, which are nerve cells in the brain of the fruit fly.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A handout microscopic image of a fruit fly released August 11, 2006. (REUTERS/CSIRO/Handout)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/50658aca-3e9c-45d2-b150-fcbd756a4c69_cx0_cy22_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A handout microscopic image of a fruit fly released August 11, 2006.

<p>The scientific name of the animal is Drosophila melanogaster. It is often used in scientific experiments, especially studies of nerve cells.</p>
<p>The researchers wanted to find out exactly how the brain cells operate when they are healthy and normal.</p>
<p>Sebastian Seung was one of the leaders of the research, which was published as a series of studies in <em>Nature</em>. Seung is a professor at Princeton University in New Jersey. He said, “You might be asking why we should care about the brain of a fruit fly. My simple answer is that if we can truly understand how any brain <strong>functions</strong>, it's bound to tell us something about all brains.”</p>
<p>The brain of a fruit fly is small — less than one millimeter wide. But some scientists are very interested in them. “It's beautiful,” said Cambridge researcher Gregory Jefferis.</p>
<p><strong>What the map showed</strong></p>
<p>The researchers created what they called a “wiring <strong>diagram</strong>” of an adult fruit fly. It is also called a “connectome” map. The goal was to create a map that shows how neurons connect to one another and how they operate.</p>
<p>Similar research has been done with simpler forms of life. For example, scientists have mapped the “brain” of a worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. They have also mapped the neural material of the <strong>larval</strong> form of the fruit fly. But the adult fruit fly was more complex. The idea was to link the neural connections to the behavior of the animal.</p>
<p>Mala Murthy was another co-leader of the research from Princeton. Murthy said, “One of the major questions we're addressing is how the wiring in the brain, its neurons and connections, can <strong>give rise to</strong> animal behavior.”</p>
<p>One of the studies in the series examined the brain <strong>circuits</strong> involved in walking. It discovered how flies halt. Another studied the fly's network of neurons associated with tasting and also grooming circuits. These circuits are behind the behavior in which a fly uses its leg to remove dirt from <strong>antennae</strong> on its head.</p>
<p>One of the studies examined how a fly processes motion and color information. And still another looked closely at how parts of the fly's brain were connected. That study discovered that a large group of neurons called “hub neurons” might help speed up the flow of information.</p>
<p>The researchers created the map by following how both sides of the brain were organized and linked the circuits they identified to behaviors. They also identified classes of cells in the fly's brain and examined the chemical connections between neurons known as synapses.</p>
<p>The international collaboration of scientists called FlyWire Consortium carried out the research.</p>

            <title>Study: Pregnancy Changes the Brain (2024/10/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>When a brain scientist at the University of California, Irvine<strong> </strong>got pregnant at the age of 38, she saw a rare chance. <strong>Neuroscientist</strong> Liz Chrastil wanted to see how her brain changed while she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Chrastil was among a group of researchers who presented their findings in a new study. It offers the first detailed map of one woman's brain through the steps of pregnancy, also called <strong>gestation</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A pregnant woman stands for a portrait in Dallas, May 18, 2023. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/ff7d21d1-ad31-4ac5-bb8d-0ca31222ca4d_cx3_cy13_cw94_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A pregnant woman stands for a portrait in Dallas, May 18, 2023. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)</span></div>
<p>Researchers say that motherhood affects nearly every part of the brain.</p>
<p>The researchers studied the effects of pregnancy in only one person: Chrastil. But their study has started a large international research project that aims to <strong>scan</strong> the brains of hundreds of women. The study could one day provide information about disorders<strong> </strong>like postpartum depression. Postpartum means after birth has taken place.</p>
<p>Chrastil said it has been a very long process. “We did 26 scans before, during and after pregnancy...” She said some of the findings were very noteworthy, or in her words “remarkable.” Chrastil is co-writer of the study that researchers published in <em>Nature Neuroscience </em>in September.</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of the parts of the brain studied had reductions in the amount of gray matter, where thinking takes place. This is an average of about four percent of the brain. This amount is nearly the same as the amount of reduction that happens during puberty. Puberty is the biological changes that cause a person to become a fertile adult.</p>
<p>However, the researchers said the reduction is probably not a bad thing. It might mean that networks of interconnected nerve cells called “neural circuits” are preparing for a new time in a woman's life.</p>
<p>The team began following Chrastil shortly before she became pregnant through <strong>in vitro fertilization</strong>. During the pregnancy and for two years after she gave birth, they continued doing <strong>MRI</strong> brain scans and blood tests to see how her brain changed. During this time, Chrastil's sex <strong>hormones</strong>, like estrogen, increased and decreased. Some of the changes continued past pregnancy.</p>
<p>Emily Jacobs is with the University of California, Santa Barbara and was also a co-writer of the study. Jacobs said earlier studies had taken scans of the brain before and after pregnancy. But she said, none had shown changes in the brain as they were taking place.</p>
<p>Unlike past studies, this one centered on many inner areas of the brain as well as the <strong>cerebral cortex</strong>, the outermost area, said Joseph Lonstein. He is a professor of neuroscience and <strong>psychology </strong>at Michigan State University and was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>Lonstein said it is “a good first step to understanding much more about whole-brain changes that could be possible in a woman across pregnancy and postpartum.”</p>
<p>Research in animals has linked some brain changes with qualities that could help the animal care for an infant. The new study does not deal with what the changes mean in terms of human behavior.</p>
<p>However, Lonstein said that it does describe changes in brain areas involved in social cognition, or thinking. This is how people act with others -- for example, how they understand their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>The researchers have partners in Spain, and they are developing what they call the <strong>Maternal</strong> Brain Project. The Ann S. Bowers Women's Brain Health <strong>Initiative</strong> and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative support the project. The researchers say they hope scientists can use findings from more than one woman to predict problems such as postpartum depression.</p>
<p>“There is so much about the neurobiology of pregnancy that we don't understand yet,...” Jacobs said.</p>
<p>She added that this is not because women and pregnancy are too complex. More is not known about pregnancy and the brain, she said, because “biomedical sciences have historically ignored women's health.”</p>

            <title>Some US Cities Use Sheep, Goats to Control Plant Growth (2024/10/15)</title>

<p>Some American communities and universities have been experimenting with sheep and goats to keep plant growth under control.</p>
<p>Along the Cumberland River near Nashville, Tennessee, visitors on boats watch the large buildings of the city in the distance. But they also can see something few expected: hundreds of sheep eating grass, or grazing, along the river.</p>
<p><strong>Sheep to remove unwanted plants </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A flock of sheep called the Chew Crew move along the Cumberland River bank Tuesday, July 9, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn.

<p>Zach Richardson oversees the sheep. His business is called Nashville Chew Crew. Richardson said sometimes the boats will go out of their way to let passengers get a closer look at his sheep. The group of sheep can be seen grazing a few hundred meters away from places where many people live and work.</p>
<p>The joy people get from watching sheep eat is partly why the creatures are becoming popular workers in some urban areas.</p>
<p>“Everybody that comes out here and experiences the sheep, they enjoy it more than they would someone...with a<strong> leaf blower</strong> or a <strong>weed eater</strong>,” Richardson said.</p>
<p>Using sheep to control plants is not a new method. But more American communities are choosing sheep to deal with problems such as invasive <strong>species</strong>, wildfire risks, native plant protection, and to keep historic places in good condition.</p>
<p>In 2017, Nashville's parks department paid for the Chew Crew to control unwanted plant growth at Fort Negley. The Union Army built the fort during the U.S. Civil War. Unwanted plants, or weeds, were growing between and along its stones. Tools like lawnmowers could easily damage the stones.</p>
<p>Sheep now graze in an area of about 61 hectares of city property yearly, including in the historic Nashville City Cemetery.</p>
<p>Jim Hester is assistant director of Metro Nashville Parks. Speaking about the sheep, he said, “It is a more environmentally <strong>sustainable</strong> way to care for the greenspace and oftentimes is cheaper than doing it with handheld equipment and <strong>staff</strong>."</p>
<p>Dogs watch over the Chew Crew's sheep. The dogs spend their whole lives with the sheep and keep visitors and animals from getting too close. The group of sheep, or flock, is made up of hair sheep, a kind of animal that naturally releases its hair fibers and is often used for meat.</p>
<p><strong>Santa Barbara fire protection </strong></p>
<p>Santa Barbara, California, has been using sheep for about seven years to protect land<strong> buffers</strong> that can slow or stop the spread of wildfires.</p>
<p>“The community loves the grazers and it's kind of a great way of community engagement,” said Monique O'Conner, open space planner for the city's parks and recreation.</p>
<p>The grazed areas can change how fire moves, said Mark vonTillow, the wildland specialist for the Santa Barbara City Fire Department.</p>
<p>VonTillow said that, if a fire hits a grazed area, “The fire behavior reacts <strong>drastically</strong> and drops to the ground.” He added, “That gives firefighters a chance to attack the fire.”</p>
<p>Some universities have tried using goats and sheep on their properties. In 2010, weeds were overtaking an area at the University of Georgia that was not used by students or staff. The weeds were pushing out native plants, said Kevin Kirsche, the school's director of sustainability.</p>
<p>Rather than using chemicals or mowers, Kirsche said the university hired Jennif Chandler to send in a<strong> herd</strong> of goats.</p>
<p>“Bringing the goats to the site was an <strong>alternative</strong> means of removing invasive plants in a way that was nontoxic to the environment and friendly to people,” Kirsche said.</p>
<p>At the time, Richardson, the owner of Chew Crew, was a student at the University of Georgia studying landscape architecture. He got the idea to create his own goat grazing business. The goats became the most popular four-legged creatures on campus, he said.</p>
<p>Richardson, who moved his company to Nashville after finishing his studies, now prefers sheep over goats. Sheep have closer group ties and are not as likely as goats to climb and explore.</p>
<p>“I'll never own another goat,” he admitted. “It's like trying to fence in water.”</p>
<p>But sheep are not an answer for all cities and their lands, O'Conner said. “We want to educate the public on why we're choosing to graze where we're grazing,” she added.</p>
<p>Hundreds of sheep can affect the environment by spreading seeds. The city of Santa Barbara does environmental studies before bringing in grazers since the process can also affect birds.</p>
<p>“Throwing like 500 sheep into an area is a much larger<strong> impact</strong> on the land and those soils than our native <strong>herbivores</strong> would have,” O'Conner said.</p>

            <title>Study: 610 Kinds of Birds Have Disappeared in Past 130,000 Years (2024/10/14)</title>

<p>New research says that 610 bird <strong>species</strong> have died off over the past 130,000 years.</p>
<p>For instance, the Kaua'i 'ō'ō, a Hawaiian songbird, was declared <strong>extinct</strong> just last year.</p>
<p>The recent research also suggested that an “ongoing biodiversity crisis” that requires urgent study is taking place.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A flock of Common Teal fly across a wetland on a winter day on the outskirts of Srinagar on January 22, 2018.

<p>Bird species have a special purpose within the environment. When a bird species disappears, nothing remains to do its job, suggested Tom Matthews of the University of Birmingham in England. Matthews was the lead writer of the study that appeared recently in the publication Science.</p>
<p>Matthews said that birds do many important jobs in an environment. These jobs include spreading seeds, eating insects, or reusing dead material. Vultures, for example, eat the flesh of dead animals.</p>
<p>Matthews said a good example of the importance of birds is "on the islands of Mauritius and Hawaii, where all or almost all the native...birds that eat fruit...have gone extinct."</p>
<p>He explained, "In eating the fruits and then moving around, birds will <strong>disperse</strong> the seeds of the plants the fruits belong to.” The lack of seed spreading can have secondary effects, Matthews said. For example, Mauritius now has many threatened tree species.</p>
<p>Most of the documented extinctions have taken place on islands.</p>
<p>The loss of living areas for birds can have big effects given the limited area involved. Many island birds are flightless, meaning they cannot fly away to escape <strong>predators</strong>.</p>
<p>As a result, flightless birds are easily hurt by new predators, such as rats or cats, Matthews suggested.</p>
<p>Human hunting of birds was a big reason behind the disappearance of different bird species in the past. Bird hunting remains a big problem in some areas. Capturing birds for the songbird trade is a big problem, particularly in Southeast Asia, Matthews said.</p>
<p>Some areas and species had more exact reasons for bird disappearances. For example, avian malaria, introduced by people, has resulted in large numbers of extinctions in Hawaii where the birds possessed no natural immunity.</p>
<p>Matthews suggested that the effects of a changing climate on birds remains a “big unknown.”</p>
<p>Many birds have been lost over time.</p>
<p>The large flightless “elephant birds” were native to Madagascar. The bird is believed to have disappeared after people arrived. That includes Aepyornis maximus. It was about 3 meters tall and was possibly the largest bird that ever existed.</p>
<p>The flightless moa birds, native to New Zealand, including the South Island giant moa, also disappeared after humans came to the islands.</p>
<p>North America's passenger pigeon numbered in the billions but was hunted to extinction.</p>
<p>The researchers said the 610 bird species combined represented 3 billion years of evolutionary history. Each lost species is like cutting off a branch from the tree of life.</p>
<p>The number 610 is "likely a large underestimate" of avian extinctions, Matthews said. This is because of a lack of data from some areas and the fact some lost species may not have left behind bones or other evidence.</p>
<p>Matthews added, "the <strong>vast</strong> majority of extinctions over the last 50,000 years are <strong>attributable</strong> to human actions."</p>
<p>About 11,000 bird species now exist. The researchers projected future extinctions of more than 1,000 species over the next two hundred years.</p>
<p>"So even if you don't care about the moral and <strong>ethical</strong> concerns regarding the loss of species, these extinctions are important for other reasons, such as the loss of species that helped the environment to <strong>function</strong> effectively," Matthews added.</p>

<span class="datetime">13 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A European spacecraft has been launched to explore an <strong>asteroid</strong> struck in an earlier planetary defense mission by the American space agency NASA.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA's) Hera spacecraft launched October 7 from NASA's Cape Canaveral in Florida. The spacecraft, or probe, was carried to space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
<p>Hera is headed to the asteroid Dimorphos. NASA crashed its DART spacecraft into the space rock in 2022 in an area about 11 million kilometers from Earth. The NASA mission was an experiment to test a method for changing the orbit of asteroids that might one day threaten Earth.</p>

<p>NASA has said its own studies of the crash <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/new-studies-show-nasa-s-asteroid-crash-test-was-highly-successful/6998173.html" target="_blank">showed it was successful</a> because the force of the strike changed the asteroid's orbit around a larger asteroid, called Didymos. Data showed the strike reduced the orbital period of Dimorphos by 33 minutes.</p>
<p>But the Hera mission seeks to closely examine Dimorphos to get more details on how the asteroid was changed in the strike by DART. Data collected by the ESA spacecraft will be used together with information gathered by NASA to develop future planetary defense plans.</p>
<p>American astronomer Derek Richardson, from the University of Maryland, told reporters before the launch, "The more detail we can <strong>glean</strong> the better as it may be important for planning a future <strong>deflection</strong> mission should one be needed.”</p>
<p>Officials from ESA have described the $400 million mission as a “crash <strong>scene</strong> investigation.” Hera project manager Ian Carnelli said the spacecraft was “going back to the crime site and getting all the scientific and technical information.”</p>
<p>Hera's trip to the asteroid is expected to take about two years. Next year, the probe plans to get a big gravitational push as it flies past Mars. It should arrive in the area around Dimorphos in December 2026.</p>

</span>
<p>Before it was hit by DART, Dimorphos circled a larger asteroid from about 1,189 meters out. Scientists believe the orbit is now closer and that Dimorphos changed its shape. Astronomers have also found evidence the asteroid is likely moving differently.</p>
<p>Examinations of the DART mission have suggested that rather than being a single hard rock, Dimorphos was more of a collection of <strong>rubble</strong> pieces held together by gravity. Investigators have said they believe the DART crash might have "completely deformed" the asteroid.</p>
<p>Ignacio Tanco is the flight director for the Hera mission. He told The Associated Press that some large rocks and other materials could still be following the asteroid. This, he said, could present a damage risk to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>“We don't really know very well the environment in which we are going to operate,” Tanco said. "But that's the whole point of the mission is to go there and find out.”</p>
<p>Hera will be equipped with two nanosatellites. One will land on Dimorphos and capture data on the asteroid with radar. The other will study the makeup of Dimorphos from farther out.</p>
<p>ESA and NASA will use the data to create plans for a possible asteroid strike that could cause wide destruction on Earth. Astronomers believe an asteroid wider than one kilometer – which could cause a worldwide disaster – is estimated to strike Earth about every 500,000 years.</p>
<p>An asteroid around 140 meters – which is a little smaller than Dimorphos but could still take out a major city – is predicted to hit Earth around every 20,000 years.</p>
<p>Currently there are no known 140-meter asteroids on a path to strike Earth. However, scientists have said only 40 percent of those space rocks are believed to have been identified.</p>

            <title>Italian Family Aims to Prove Its Painting Is a Picasso (2024/10/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/italian-family-aims-to-prove-its-painting-is-a-picasso.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By </span><br/><span class="datetime">13 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A family in Italy hopes to prove that a painting found long ago on the island of Capri is the work of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.</p>
<p>The family has been gathering scientific evidence to support the claim. It wants officials of the Picasso <strong>estate</strong> to confirm Picasso as the painting's creator.</p>
<p>A man found the painting in a load of waste he took possession of as a <strong>junk</strong> dealer more than 60 years ago. He hung the picture in his home for a long time. Later, it hung in a restaurant in Pompei, Italy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A painting is seen at a restoration laboratory in Milan, Italy, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3dd3f6c1-85ef-4b95-aa69-75819262b414_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A painting is seen at a restoration laboratory in Milan, Italy, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)</span></div>
<p>Then the man's son, Andrea Lo Russo, began to investigate the painting that, he said, his mother described as “<strong>ugly</strong>.”</p>
<p>He said he first came to think the painting was important after seeing a picture of a Picasso painting in a schoolbook. Later, as a young adult, Lo Russo and his brother took the painting to Paris. They showed it to experts at the Picasso Museum there.</p>
<p>“They looked, and they said, ‘it is not possible,'” Lo Russo remembered. The brothers refused the museum's offer to keep the painting for further study, he said.</p>
<p>Lo Russo said that his research into the painting's <strong>origin</strong> sometimes connected him with dishonest people. He said some people tricked<strong> </strong>him<strong> </strong>for money. One situation led officials to investigate him as a possible trafficker of false artwork.</p>
<p>That investigation ended after he produced paperwork confirming his effort to identify the family's painting.</p>
<p>After more than 20 years of trying, Lo Russo believes that recent tests carried out by the Swiss-based Arcadia Foundation prove that his painting is from Picasso.</p>
<p>Luca Marcante is a trained chemist who started the Arcadia Foundation in 2000 to investigate artwork. Marcante said laboratory tests show the paints used were like those Picasso used in one period of his career.</p>
<p>Most recently, a handwriting expert confirmed that the name written in the upper left corner of the painting is Picasso's handwriting, Marcante said.</p>
<p>For the art world, however, only one group can <strong>authenticate</strong> the painting as Picasso's work: the Picasso Administration in Paris. But, it has not answered a series of requests over the years.</p>
<p>Marcante said that he is preparing to share the most recent findings with them. He explains it this way: “You need to understand, they get dozens of inquiries every day from private people believing they have found a Picasso.”</p>
<p>The Picasso Administration chose not to speak to the Associated Press about the painting.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tete du femme </strong></em></p>
<p>Marcante said the painting is similar to <em>Tete du femme</em>,<em> </em>a 1949 painting that is believed to be a Picasso. It is part of a digital collection overseen by Sam Houston State University in Texas.</p>
<p>Adding to the mystery, Marcante said there is photographic evidence that Picasso visited the ruins of Pompeii in 1917. Marcante also said it is likely the artist visited Capri in the 1940s.</p>
<p>But expert Enrique Mallen doubts the painting is really Picasso's work. He said, “From what I know of studying Picasso for 30 years, he would never do an identical copy of his own work.”</p>
<p>The only record of <em>Tete du femme</em> is documentation from a 1967 book, which said the painting was in a private collection in Turin, Italy. Mallen said there is no other evidence of the painting.</p>
<p>Marcante called <em>Tete du femme</em> “a ghost painting, because no one has ever seen it.” He added, “The only real one is ours, that we have examined in a scientific manner...”</p>
<p>Lo Russo said that his family has not decided what to do with the painting if it is confirmed as a Picasso. Many people are asking about it now since news about the painting spread in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“We are <strong>confused</strong> ourselves,” he said.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>One of the best things about traveling to a new country is learning about new traditions and customs. They can be very different from our own.</p>
<p>When visiting a foreign county, it is smart to follow the local social rules and customs of the people who live there. This can make your stay easier and more enjoyable.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A street vendor sells hats in front of the Colosseum in Rome, Monday, July 17, 2023. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0a00-0242-d9e1-08db86e11944_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A street vendor sells hats in front of the Colosseum in Rome, Monday, July 17, 2023.

<p>Today we talk about <strong>fitting in </strong>with the way local people do things. We talk about an expression that goes all the way back to ancient Rome:</p>
<p><u>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</u></p>
<p>This expression means that when we visit a place, we should follow the customs and norms of that place. This expression shows an <strong>attitude</strong> or <strong>mindset</strong>: You are willing to change your way of doing things to fit in with those around you.</p>
<p>The place does not have to be a new country. It can simply be a new situation or environment. For example, let's say you usually speak very loudly. But when visiting an art museum or library, you whisper in a low voice. You follow the rules of that place. <u>When in Rome ...</u></p>
<p>English speakers often shorten the expression to <u>“when in Rome...”</u></p>
<p>This expression has another meaning. When you are in an unfamiliar situation, you should follow the lead of those who know the rules. These people know how to <strong>behave </strong>with others. They know how to play the game. They know how to work within the system. They don't do things differently. They<strong> blend</strong><strong> in</strong>.</p>
<p>But what does Rome have to do with following other people's customs? Several websites describe how the expression may have begun. And if they are correct, this expression is very old.</p>
<p>Here is how the story goes:</p>
<p><em>During the time of the Roman Empire more than 1500 years ago, a Christian leader, Saint Augustine, moved from Rome to Milan. Once in the new city, he found some parts of religious life to be different. For example, in Rome he <strong>fasted,</strong> or did not eat, on Saturday. But in Milan, people did not fast on Saturday. Another church leader, Saint Ambrose, gave him some advice. St. Ambrose said that when he goes to Rome he fasts on Saturdays. But when he is in Milan, he does not. Problem solved.</em></p>
<p>This good advice, or proverb, has survived over the years. Some word experts say it first appeared in English around 500 years ago.</p>
<p>But we still use it to this day -- either to give advice or to describe a situation where we have to change our behavior to fit in.</p>
<p>Let's hear another example.</p>
<p><em>A: How was your trip to see your brother's family?</em></p>
<p><em>B: It was really fun. Different but fun. </em></p>
<p><em>A: How was it different?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, they live in the country and love to hunt and fish. So, that's what I did all week. It was great! </em></p>
<p><em>A: I am so surprised. I didn't think you were the <strong>outdoorsy</strong> type.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I'm not! But <u>when in Rome ...</u></em></p>
<p><em>A: With that attitude, it's <strong>no wonder</strong> you had a fun trip!</em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>A series of powerful hurricanes have affected millions of people in the United States in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Some people are wondering if scientists could control extreme weather events. However, experts say hurricanes are far too powerful for humans to control.</p>
<p>Climate change is leading to increasingly powerful storms. This has led to greater attention on the possibilities of geoengineering.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Bayou West resident and friend try to salvage items from her home after an apparent tornado touched down on the central beach community after Hurricane Milton in Vero Beach, Fla., Oct.11, 2024.

<p>Geoengineering involves futuristic ideas for <strong>reversing</strong> or lessening climate change. But many scientists have serious concerns about unwanted results.</p>
<p>Hurricanes are an example of the uncontrollable, disordered power of Earth's weather. Experts say there is no clear evidence from research to show humans might be able to control such strong storms.</p>
<p>Kristen Corbosiero is a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany. Corbosiero is a weather expert, or meteorologist. She said: "If meteorologists could stop hurricanes, we would stop hurricanes. If we could control the weather, we would not want the kind of death and destruction that's happened."</p>
<p><strong>Weather experts' opinions on controlling hurricanes</strong></p>
<p>National Hurricane Center tropical <strong>analysis</strong> chief Chris Landsea said that a fully developed hurricane releases heat energy that is the equal to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes. That is more than all the energy used at a given time by human beings.</p>
<p>Chris Field is director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment in California. He said scientists are learning of the many ways that climate change is making hurricanes more powerful and destructive. Warmer oceans add energy and more water to the warming atmosphere. That water becomes strong rainfall.</p>
<p>Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbac said the amount of energy a hurricane generates is much more than humans have the power to control. But people have still made attempts to control the storms.</p>
<p><strong>Historical efforts to control hurricanes</strong></p>
<p>Jim Fleming is a professor at Colby College in Maine. He has studied historical efforts to control the weather. He said humans do not even come close to having the practical technology to successfully control the weather.</p>
<p>Fleming described one attempt in 1947. The General Electric company partnered with the U.S. military to drop dry ice from Air Force planes into the path of a hurricane to try to weaken it. It did not work.</p>
<p>Some attempts or ideas could even make the storms worse or cause greater harm. One especially dangerous idea was to use a nuclear bomb, which would cause radiation and not be strong enough to change the storm, Kristen Corbosiero said.</p>
<p>Bringing cooling <strong>icebergs</strong> or adding chemicals to cause rain also are ideas that do not work, scientists say.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering the climate</strong></p>
<p>Modern geoengineers would operate differently. Today's geoengineers are thinking about how to <strong>reverse</strong> the damage humans have already caused.</p>
<p>Scientists in the field say one of the most promising ideas they see based on computer models is <strong>solar</strong> geoengineering. The method would involve lifting small particles into the upper atmosphere to return some of the sunlight back into space, cooling the planet a little. Still, supporters of the idea know that it comes with risks.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) announced it was forming an <strong>ethics </strong>agreement for climate intervention. The AGU is the largest society of scientists who study climate issues.</p>

            <title>How to Improve Your Spelling (2024/10/12)</title>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Guillermo in Argentina about how to spell words in English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/4ec92eba-4c0f-40d5-9a0e-3106d24bba11_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>When I hear some new words in English, I can find their meaning, but for me, the spelling is always difficult. Can you please give me [some] advice?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Guillermo</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Guillermo.</p>
<p>English spelling can be difficult for several reasons. For many letters in the English alphabet, a letter can represent several sounds.</p>
<p>Let's listen to the sound the letter “A” makes in each of the following six words:</p>
<p><em>cat</em></p>
<p><em>day</em></p>
<p><em>father</em></p>
<p><em>ball</em></p>
<p><em>many</em></p>
<p><em>attack</em></p>
<p>Can you hear the difference between the two letters “A” of the last word? Let's listen again.</p>
<p><em>attack</em></p>
<p>The first syllable made the quick schwa sound “/<strong><i></i>601;/</strong>”.</p>
<p>Because an English letter can make different sounds, words that have similar spellings can sound different from each other, as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>lemon </em>and<em> demon</em></p>
<p><em>daughter </em>and<em> laughter</em></p>
<p><em>war </em>and<em> far</em></p>
<p>In addition, words that have different spellings can sound the same. These are called homophones, as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>pause </em>and<em> paws</em></p>
<p><em>rode </em>and<em> road</em></p>
<p><em>deer </em>and<em> dear</em></p>
<p>But that's not all. In many words, some letters are silent—they are not pronounced at all, like the letter “b” at the end of the word “climb”.</p>
<p>You can see from all of the above examples that you cannot only use the sounds of words to know how to spell them. So, what should you do?</p>
<p><strong>Spelling rules</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, English does have some general rules for spelling.</p>
<p>For example, a famous rule that children learn in school is “<em>I</em> before <em>e</em> except after <em>c.”</em> This gives us the spelling of words such as:</p>
<p><em>piece</em></p>
<p><em>niece</em></p>
<p><em>receive</em></p>
<p>But be careful! There are still many words in English that break the spelling rules. The word “science,” for example, breaks the “I before e” rule. For words such as these, you simply have to memorize how to spell them. And how can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Memorizing words</strong></p>
<p>The best way to help your memory is to read as much as possible and practice writing. Writing can test how well you know how to spell. Most computer programs also include a spell-checker, where misspelled words are underlined in a color. This helps you see any spelling mistakes you have made and also shows you the correct spelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing patterns</strong></p>
<p>In addition to rules, there are spelling <strong>patterns</strong>. You can group words into the pattern they follow. For example, some words that have the spelling -ough include:</p>
<p><em>rough, tough, cough, though, </em>and <em>bought</em>.</p>
<p>Notice, however, that with these examples, the letters -ough made three different vowel sounds:</p>
<p><em>rough, cough, though</em></p>
<p>This again shows the need to memorize spellings because the sound of the word will not always tell you how to spell it.</p>
<p><strong>Having fun</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, becoming good at spelling can be enjoyable. Think of it like a game or other activity you enjoy. Over time, you will feel good as you learn to spell more and more words. There are many books, websites, and apps designed for spelling practice. Try to use these and practice your spelling.</p>

<p>South Korean writer Han Kang won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday. The Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee said her work “confronts historical <strong>traumas</strong> and exposes the <strong>fragility</strong> of human life.”</p>
<p>Born in 1970, Han Kang is the first South Korean to win the literature prize. Kang began her career in 1993 with the publication of several poems in <em>Literature and Society</em>. She published her first story in 1995 with <em>Love of Yeosu.</em></p>
<p>In 2016, Kang won the Man Booker International Prize for <em>The Vegetarian.</em> It tells the story of a woman's decision to stop eating meat and her family's worry about her mental health. The <strong>novel</strong> was the first of her books to be translated into English and was seen as her major international breakthrough.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Han Kang speaks to the media after winning the Man Booker International prize for fiction for her book 'The Vegetarian' in London, Tuesday, May, 16, 2016.

<p>In a talk with the Booker Prizes, published last year, Kang said the book was written during a difficult period in her life. She questioned whether she could finish the story or even survive as a writer.</p>
<p>"I was suffering from severe <strong>arthritis</strong>...To this day, I feel awkward when I hear about the novel's ‘success,'” she said.</p>
<p>In the novel <em>Human Acts</em>, Kang explored the 1980 killing of hundreds of students and unarmed civilians by the South Korean military in the city of Gwangju, where she grew up.</p>
<p>"In seeking to give voice to the victims of history, the book confronts this episode with <strong>brutal</strong> actualization and, in so doing, approaches the <strong>genre</strong> of witness literature," the Academy said.</p>
<p><strong>One of two South Korean Nobel winners</strong></p>
<p>Kang is the second South Korean to win a Nobel Prize. Former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his efforts to restore democracy in the South and improve relations with North Korea.</p>
<p>The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too centered on European and North American writings. It has also been awarded mainly to male writers. Kang is only the 18th woman to receive the award among more than 100 winners.</p>
<p>Past winners of the prize include well-known writers like Irish poet W.B. Yeats, American writer Ernest Hemingway and Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez. In 2016, American singer Bob Dylan also received the prize “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”</p>
<p>Mats Malm is Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy. He told reporters, “I was able to talk to Han Kang over the phone. She was having an ordinary day, it seems, she had just finished <strong>supper</strong> with her son."</p>
<p>The prize comes with a money award of $1.1 million.</p>

<p>Powerful crime groups in Southeast Asia use the messaging app Telegram widely, the United Nations said in a report on Monday. It said the app's use led to major changes in the way such groups carry out large criminal operations.</p>
<p>The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) produced the report. The investigators say stolen data, including credit card information, passwords and <strong>browser</strong> history, are openly traded on the app. The app has many channels and little content supervision, the report said.</p>
<p>Criminals on the app also sell tools used for cybercrime, including so-called <strong>deepfake</strong> software and data-stealing <strong>malware</strong>. And, criminal <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> exchanges carry out business on Telegram also, the report said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Telegram app logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 27, 2024. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/4b0d8111-f03c-44a1-b2cc-c8cfacb24f2a_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Telegram app logo is seen in this illustration taken, August 27, 2024. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)</span></div>
<p>"We move 3 million USDT stolen from overseas per day," the report quoted one advertisement as saying in Chinese.</p>
<p>There is "strong evidence of underground data markets moving to Telegram and <strong>vendors</strong> actively looking to target transnational organized crime groups based in Southeast Asia," the report said.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia has emerged as a center for a multibillion-dollar online crime industry that targets victims across the world. Many industry members are Chinese criminal groups that operate from large, protected complexes using trafficked workers. The industry makes between $27.4 billion to $36.5 billion yearly, the UNODC said.</p>
<p>In August, French police arrested Telegram's leader Pavel Durov in Paris. Officials charged him with permitting criminal activity on the site, including the online spread of sexual images of children.</p>
<p>Telegram, which has close to 1 billion users, did not immediately answer a request for comment</p>
<p>Following his arrest, Durov said the app would surrender users' IP addresses and phone numbers to French officials making legal requests. He also said the app would remove some tools that have been abused for illegal activity.</p>
<p>The report said the huge amount of profit earned by criminal groups in the area led them to change their operating methods. They established new business models and added technologies to their systems, including malware, generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes, officials say.</p>
<p>The UNODC said it had identified more than ten deepfake software service providers “targeting criminal groups involved in cyber-enabled <strong>fraud</strong> in Southeast Asia."</p>

            <title>Study: US Hurricanes Much Deadlier Than Government Estimates (2024/10/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A new study says hurricanes in the United States are hundreds of times deadlier than government estimates say. In fact, the research finds, they result in more American deaths over the long term than car accidents or wars.</p>
<p>The study found the average storm that hits the U.S. <strong>contributes</strong> to the early deaths of 7,000 to 11,000 people over a 15-year period.</p>
<p>Solomon Hsiang is a climate economist at Stanford University in California. Hsiang co-wrote the study with Rachel Young of the University of California Berkeley.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This GOES-16 GeoColor satellite image taken at 12:15 p.m. EDT and provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows Hurricane Milton in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Oct. 8, 2024.

(NOAA via AP)</span></div>
<p>“After each storm there is sort of this surge of additional <strong>mortality</strong> in a state that's been <strong>impacted </strong>that has not been <strong>previously</strong> documented or<strong> associated</strong> with hurricanes in any way,” Hsiang said.</p>
<p><em>Nature</em> magazine published the study.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers take a wider look </strong></p>
<p>The research considers hurricane deaths in a new way: through examination of long-term public health and economic effects of what is called <strong>excess</strong> mortality. The investigators looked at individual state death rates following 501 separate storms in the United States between 1930 and 2015. Their research shows a sudden rise or “bump” in death rates after each storm.</p>
<p>Similar examinations are done for heat waves and other health threats like pollution and disease, Hsiang said. They compare death rates to pre-storm times while accounting for other influences that could be causing change to those rates, he said.</p>
<p>Hsiang said additional research is needed to learn how storms contribute to deaths after the bad weather passes. But he theorized that storms cause major stress as well as environmental changes, including the spread of poisonous substances. He also said the economic cost of storms can leave people unable to pay for health care and other necessities.</p>
<p><strong>Early deaths</strong></p>
<p>“When someone dies a few years after a hurricane hit them, the cause will be recorded as a heart attack, stroke or respiratory failure,” said Texas A&amp;M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. He was not part of the study but has done similar research on heat and cold deaths.</p>
<p>Hsiang said he and Young were surprised when they examined hundreds of bumps and found they stretch out over 15 years.</p>
<p>It's “almost like a <strong>trickle</strong> of mortality, like each month we're talking about five to 10 individuals who are dying earlier than they would have otherwise," Hsiang said.</p>
<p>These deaths are of people who did not realize their health issues were connected to storms that took place years earlier. But, Hsiang said, that is what the data shows: "They would not have died at those times had the storm not arrived.”</p>
<p>The numbers proved so high that the researchers kept looking for mistakes in their work. “It took years for us to really fully accept that this was happening," Hsiang said.</p>
<p><strong>How big are the numbers?</strong></p>
<p>Storms are a factor in between 55,000 to 88,000 excess deaths each year, the study found. Over the 85 years included in the study, the team found that between 3.6 million and 5.2 million people died in connection with storm experience. That is more than the two million car accident deaths over that same period, the study said.</p>
<p>Hsiang said he and Young saw a <strong>trend</strong> of increasing hurricane-connected deaths, mostly as a result of population growth. Beginning in 2000, there was a big jump in the total volume of storms hitting large populations, he said.</p>

            <title>Tech Tip: Instagram’s New Tools to Protect Young Users (2024/10/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/tech-tip-instagram-s-new-tools-to-protect-young-users.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Meta's Instagram service recently introduced some built-in tools designed to protect young users. The changes also give parents more control over their children's accounts to improve safety and limit the amount of time spent on the social networking <strong>app</strong>.</p>
<p>Instagram <a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/#:~:text=Teens%20under%2016%20will%20need%20their%20parent's%20permission%20to%20use,to%20turn%20on%20parental%20supervision.">says</a> the new tools aim to “<strong>reassure</strong> parents that teens are having safe experiences.” The main change was the establishment of Teen Accounts, which Meta says was developed “with parents and teens in mind.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press offers the following tips as a guide for parents to get the most out of the new tools.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, students use their cellphones as they leave for the day the Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts High School in downtown Los Angeles, Aug. 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/170a62cc-b678-4c17-bb1e-a11dbfe92812_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, students use their cellphones as they leave for the day the Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts High School in downtown Los Angeles, Aug. 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>What limits will young users have? </strong></p>
<p>Instagram already restricts anyone under 13 from signing up for the service. Now, teen accounts will <strong>automatically</strong> be set to private. That means they will have to accept or reject requests from new followers. Other users will not be able to see a teen user's posts and videos or communicate with the account.</p>
<p>Teens will also face messaging restrictions. They can only receive direct messages from people they are following or who follow them. But they can still send messages to other accounts.</p>
<p>Teen Accounts will also restrict certain kinds of material, or content. This will include sensitive subjects such as videos of people fighting or content that pushes methods to improve appearance. In addition, Instagram's anti-bullying tools will be set to the highest level to prevent offensive words and phrases in comments and direct message requests.</p>
<p>To restrict usage time, teens will get a message to stop using the app after it has been open for more than an hour. This message can be ignored, however.</p>
<p><strong>Can the new limits be changed?</strong></p>
<p>The new limits will be turned on automatically for all teens. But 16 and 17-year-olds will have the ability to turn them off. Children under 16 will need parental permission to do so.</p>
<p>Teens might also seek to lie about their age to get around the restrictions. But Meta has made it more difficult for them to do so. Young users are required to confirm their ages by uploading an identification card or by sending a short video of themselves.</p>
<p>Instagram says it will also begin testing artificial intelligence (AI) software early next year that will aim to prevent false birth dates from being accepted.</p>
<p><strong>New controls for parents </strong></p>
<p>If a parent does not think the limits for their child are strong enough, they can add more protective controls. For example, a parent has the ability to see who their teen has traded messages with within the past seven days.</p>
<p>The new tools also provide controls for parents to set daily limits for Instagram use. A parent can also block a teen from using Instagram during specific times of the day and follow subjects they are seeing.</p>
<p><strong>How to set up parental controls</strong></p>
<p>To set up additional controls, a parent first needs to set up family <strong>supervision</strong> on his or her account. On the mobile app, this can be done by going into settings and scrolling to find the family center to activate the tools.</p>
<p>Next, the Teen Account will have to invite a parent. This will be in the form of a link the teen can send by text message to the parent. After accepting the invite, the teen user has 48 hours to confirm the parent's response.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the teen settings right away?</strong></p>
<p>The restrictive tools will be automatically activated for anyone under 18 who now signs up for Instagram in the U.S., Britain, Canada and Australia. For existing accounts, the restrictions will be put in place by mid-November.</p>
<p>The protections will be available for teens in the European Union's 27 countries beginning later this year. And the rest of the world will get Teen Accounts for Instagram in January. Meta says it will also bring the changes to other services like Facebook next year.</p>

<p>Three scientists who developed methods to predict the structure of proteins and build new ones have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
<p>The winners were American David Baker, a professor at the University of Washington; Briton Demis Hassabis, head of Google's DeepMind research laboratory in London; and American John Jumper, a top researcher at DeepMind. The lab centers on artificial intelligence (AI) methods.</p>
<p>Protein is one of the most important substances to life on Earth. Baker succeeded in building new kinds of proteins. Hassabis and Jumper solved a problem that had existed for 50 years. They were finally able to use AI to predict the structure of proteins.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This combo of pictures show American biochemist David Baker, from left, American researcher John Jumper and Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind Technologies, the AI division behind Gemini.

<p>The Nobel Committee for Chemistry said the discoveries “hold enormous potential.”</p>
<p>For example, committee members said the ability to build new proteins could lead to the discovery of new drugs and vaccines. It could also help scientists develop extremely small materials, called nanomaterials, and small sensors.</p>
<p>Heiner Linke is Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. He said the award honored research that made connections for the first time between amino acid sequences and protein structures.</p>
<p>“That was actually a grand challenge in chemistry, and in particular biochemistry” for many years, Linke said.</p>
<p><strong>Designing and predicting proteins</strong></p>
<p>Baker first designed a new protein in 2003. Since then, his research group has produced many different proteins. “It seems that you can almost construct any type of protein now with this technology,” said Professor Johan Aqvist of the Nobel committee.</p>
<p>The committee said Hassabis and Jumper created an AI model called AlphaFold2. It has been able to predict the structure of nearly all 200 million proteins researchers have identified.</p>
<p>Linke said, “Proteins are the molecules that enable life. Proteins are building blocks that form bones, skin, hair and tissue.” He added, “To understand how life works, we first need to understand the shape of proteins.”</p>
<p>Linke said that in 2020, Hassabis and Jumper were able to use AI methods to finally “<strong>crack the code</strong>.” That made it possible to predict the complex structure of “any known protein in nature.”</p>
<p>There are many possible uses for the technology. Researchers should be able to use it to better understand how organisms develop resistance to antibiotics. They might also be able to create images of chemical substances called enzymes that can break down plastic.</p>
<p>The committee said Baker had developed “computational tools” that enable scientists to design new proteins with new shapes and <strong>functions</strong>.</p>
<p>Baker noted that Hassabis and Jumper's work in AI had greatly helped his team.</p>
<p>“The <strong>breakthroughs</strong> made by Demis and John on protein structure prediction really highlighted to us the power that AI could have,” he said. “And that led us to <strong>apply</strong> these AI methods to protein design and that has greatly increased the power and <strong>accuracy</strong>.”</p>
<p>Baker was asked during a phone call with Nobel officials and reporters if he had a favorite protein. He said it would be difficult to choose. But he noted that one designed during the pandemic proved to be effective in protecting against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“And I've been very excited about the idea of a <strong>nasal spray</strong>, of little designed proteins, that would protect against all possible pandemic viruses.” Baker said.</p>
<p>Hassabis is a leader in Britain's technology industry. He received a knighthood earlier this year for his work in AI. He helped establish DeepMind in 2010. Google later bought the lab.</p>
<p>DeepMind first gained wide attention by developing an AI system that was able to defeat the human world champion in the Chinese game of Go faster than expected.</p>
<p>This year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry is worth about $1 million. Half of the prize will go to Baker. Hassabis and Jumper will share the other half.</p>
<p>Award ceremonies for the 2024 Nobel Prize winners will be held on December 10.</p>

<p>Unpredictable rains and increasing heat are making life more difficult for the people of Rayanpet, a village in southern India. The conditions are also damaging the rice crops grown there.</p>
<p>P. Ravinder Reddy, a former soldier, started farming on his family's land 16 years ago. He said, "We used to know when it would rain and for how long.”</p>
<p>That meant they used to know when to plant. Now, he said, it is not so predictable. Sometimes there is too much rain. Sometimes there is no rain at all.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="P.

<p>Agricultural research organizations in India have been working for years to engineer rice seeds that can survive in a changing climate. Reddy has been experimenting with new kinds of rice for the past five years. The new rice plants are producing more grain with less water. They are also more disease resistant.</p>
<p>Reddy says he has planted them across part of his 10-hectare field. He still grows some of the older kinds because there is a demand for them. But he said, “I think in a few years, we will use only these <strong>tougher</strong> seeds."</p>
<p>India is one of the world's largest producers and <strong>consumers</strong> of wheat and rice. Research organizations in that country and around the world have worked for years to produce seeds that are better able to handle <strong>drought</strong>, unseasonal rains, plant diseases and more.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a United Nations report said more than 700 million people suffered from hunger last year. More than one-third of the worldwide population does not have the money to buy healthy foods.</p>
<p><strong>Defending against climate shocks</strong></p>
<p>India has nearly 120 million farmers. Most have less than two hectares of land. Unpredictable rainfall, rising temperatures and increased <strong>pest </strong>problems all threaten their ability to grow food.</p>
<p>Experts say the dangers to rice include increasing salt content in groundwater, heavy rainfall over short periods, long periods of drought and increasing nighttime temperatures.</p>
<p>Some farmers are turning to methods of natural farming to deal with climate change. But that can mean reduced <strong>yields</strong>. India's federal government is also urging the use of climate-<strong>resilient </strong>seeds that result in better yields.</p>
<p><strong>Government research support</strong></p>
<p>Ashok Kumar Singh is former director of New Delhi-based Indian Agriculture Research Institute. He has overseen the creation of many successful rice varieties that withstand pests and plant diseases. His organization has helped release more than 2,000 climate-resilient kinds of seed in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>"We really need these seeds to deal with these multiple <strong>issues </strong>created by global warming," Singh said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi released 109 climate-resilient seeds for several different crops. India's federal government has announced plans to make sure at least 25 percent of rice-growing fields in the country will be planted with climate-resilient seeds in the coming winter crop season.</p>
<p>In Rayanpet village, Reddy is preparing to plant rice seeds for the winter season in a few weeks.</p>
<p>"It is good to keep trying new seeds, as after some time all of them will have some issue or the other," Reddy said. “If the government can also make sure we get good prices for our crops after harvest, that would help farmers like us a great deal.”</p>

<p>Two early developers of artificial intelligence (AI) have won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
<p>American John Hopfield is with Princeton University in New Jersey. Geoffrey Hinton is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honored them for helping “to develop methods that are the foundation of today's powerful machine learning.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The 2024 Nobel Prize winners in Physics, professor John Hopfield, left, of Princeton University, and professor Geoffrey Hinton, of the University of Toronto, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2024.

(Princeton University via AP and Noah Berger/AP Photo)</span></div>
<p>The 76-year-old Hinton is known as the Godfather of artificial intelligence for his part in developing machine learning. However, he also has warned that AI has created threats to humanity.</p>
<p>Ellen Moons is a member of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Moons said the two scientists “used fundamental <strong>concepts</strong> from <strong>statistical</strong> physics to design artificial <strong>neural</strong> networks that <strong>function</strong> as <strong>associative memories</strong> and find <strong>patterns</strong> in large data sets.”</p>
<p>Moons added that their research has been used to make progress in physics but has also become part of people's daily lives. Technologies like facial recognition and language <strong>translation</strong> are used every day.</p>
<p>Hinton predicted that AI would have a “huge influence” on civilization and will bring improvements to productivity and health care. He told reporters and Royal Academy officials that, “It would be comparable to the Industrial Revolution.”</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution was a period of intensive development of machines and manufacturing that started more than 250 years ago in Britain.</p>
<p>Hinton said, “Instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it's going to exceed people in intellectual ability.” But Hinton also expressed concern about the possible bad results of AI, especially noting, in his words, “the threat of these things getting out of control.”</p>
<p>The Nobel committee also recognized the possible damage the discoveries that it was honoring could cause. Moons said AI's “development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.”</p>
<p><strong>What they did</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, Hinton helped to develop a method known as backpropagation, which is used to “train” computers to learn.</p>
<p>Later, he headed a team at the University of Toronto that won the ImageNet computer competition in 2012 for designing a “neural network.”</p>
<p>Hinton and AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won the Turing Award in 2019. It is the top award in computer science. That year, Hinton told the Associated Press about the reaction he and his fellow researchers received over their work.</p>
<p>“They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly.”</p>
<p>Hopfield is now 91 years old. The Nobel committee said he “invented a network that uses a method for saving and recreating patterns.”</p>
<p>Hinton used Hopfield's network to create a new network using a different method known as the Boltzmann machine. The committee said this “machine” can learn to recognize elements in a particular kind of data.</p>
<p>“What fascinates me most is still this question of how mind comes from machine,” Hopfield said in a video posted online by The Franklin Institute after it awarded him a physics prize in 2019.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Physics is valued at $1 million. Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel created the prizes to honor discoveries that help humanity. The first prizes were awarded in 1901.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the prize in chemistry will be announced, on Thursday, the prize for literature, and Friday, the peace prize. And, the Nobel for economics will be announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The winners receive their prizes in ceremonies held on December 10.</p>

            <title>Do Students in American Schools Read Long Books Anymore? (2024/10/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Teachers in many English classes across America are having students read fewer full-length books.</p>
<p>Recently, the Associated Press explored the issue in education.</p>
<p>It reports that students instead are given only short parts of books. Educators said this is because they believe current students have shorter attention <strong>spans </strong>than those of the past. The teachers might feel pressure to prepare students for state and nationwide examinations know as standardized tests. They also might believe that short pieces of writing will help students in the modern, digital world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Chris Stanislawski, 14, of Garden City, N.Y., didn't finish any books in his 8th grade English class, in part because their google classroom had detailed summaries of each chapter of every book.

<p>The National Council of Teachers of English is a professional organization for teachers based in Champaign, Illinois. In 2022, the group released a statement about reading. “The time has come to decenter book reading and <strong>essay</strong>-writing as the <strong>pinnacles</strong> of English language arts education,” the group said.</p>
<p>Seth French helped write the statement. He said the idea was not to remove books but to teach media <strong>literacy</strong> and have students read things in which they are interested. French taught an English class before becoming a dean at Bentonville High School in the state of Arkansas. He had students read plays, poetry and articles but only one book as a class.</p>
<p>He said, “A lot of our students are not interested in some of these texts that they didn't have a choice in.”</p>
<p>Not everyone thinks English reading should involve only short, digital pieces of writing.</p>
<p>Maryanne Wolf studies the human brain at UCLA in Southern California. Wolf said deep reading is important to strengthen connections in the brain tied to critical thinking skills, background knowledge and empathy.</p>
<p>She said educators must give students a chance to learn through what she described as “<strong>immersion</strong> into the lives and thoughts of others.”</p>
<p><strong>Less reading</strong></p>
<p>There is not a lot of information on how many books American students are required to read in school. But in general, students are reading less.</p>
<p>Federal data from last year shows 14 percent of young people said they read for fun every day. In 2012, that percentage was 27 percent.</p>
<p>Some teachers say reduced reading has its roots in the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Kristy Acevedo teaches English at a vocational high school in New Bedford, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>“There was a <strong>trend</strong>, it happened when COVID hit, to stop reading full-length novels because students were in <strong>trauma</strong>; we were in a pandemic. The problem is we haven't quite come back from that,” she said.</p>
<p>Other teachers blame standardized testing and the influence of education technology.</p>
<p>Some students struggle to read. Only one third of fourth and eighth graders reached reading <strong>proficiency</strong> in the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress.</p>
<p>Leah van Belle is the director of the non-profit literacy coalition 313Reads in Detroit, Michigan. Van Belle said, when her son read the book <em>Peter Pan</em> in elementary school, it was too difficult for most children. She said her son's school does not have a library.</p>
<p>Still, she said it makes sense for English classes to use shorter reading material.</p>
<p>“As an adult, if I want to learn about a <strong>topic</strong> and research it, be it personal or professional, I'm using interactive digital text to do that,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Too many things to do</strong></p>
<p>Even in schools with many resources, time is always in short supply.</p>
<p>Terri White teaches at South Windsor High School in Connecticut. White no longer assigns the book <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> to her class.</p>
<p>She assigns about one third of the book and provides a synopsis, or a very short version, of the rest. White says the reason is that the class has to move quickly so she can teach all the required material.</p>
<p>White also assigns less homework because students have sports and other activities. She said she wanted her class to be “more about helping student become stronger and more critical readers, writers and thinkers, while taking their social-emotional well-being into account.”</p>
<p>The synopses method alone, however, can harm student critical thinking skills says Alden Jones, a literature professor at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Jones assigns fewer books than before but gives more small tests to make sure students are reading.</p>
<p>“We don't value the thinking time that we used to have. It's all time we could be on our phone accomplishing tasks,” she said.</p>
<p>Will Higgins is an English teacher at Dartmouth High School in Massachusetts. Higgins said he still believes in teaching the <strong>classics</strong>. But he said students do not have enough time, so teachers have cut back on the number of books they teach.</p>
<p>“We haven't given up on <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. We haven't given up on <em>Hamlet </em>or <em>The Great Gatsby</em>,” he said. But Higgins admitted giving up on assigning a long book like <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">07 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Two Americans have won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of genetic material called microRNA.</p>
<p>Victor Ambros is a professor at the University of Massachusetts and Gary Ruvkun is a Harvard University professor.</p>
<p>The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, a group of 50 professors, decided to award the two for identifying genetic molecules that help control how genes work.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo combo shows 2024 Nobel Prize winners in physiology or medicine Gary Ruvkun, American molecular biologist, left, and Victor Ambros,, Oct. 7, 2024, in Newton, Mass.

<p>The Nobel Assembly said the discovery is “proving to be <strong>fundamentally</strong> important for how organisms develop and <strong>function</strong>.”</p>
<p>In explaining the importance of the work, the group said it “revealed a completely new <strong>principle</strong> of gene regulation that turned out to be <strong>essential</strong> for multicellular organisms, including humans.”</p>
<p><strong>RNA and microRNA</strong></p>
<p>RNA takes genetic information from DNA through a process called transcription. RNA then becomes involved in protein production or other activities within the cell.</p>
<p>Ambros and Ruvkun found that microRNA, or very short chains of molecules, are needed for normal genetic development. The committee said changes in the way that microRNA functions can lead to major genetic changes, or mutations, over time. Nobel's website said the changes can lead to diseases such as cancer, diabetes and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Ambros carried out research that helped lead to the discovery at Harvard University. Ruvkun researched at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p><strong>Early research</strong></p>
<p>At first, Ambros and Ruvkun were interested in genes that control when genetic developments take place. These developments ensure that different kinds of cells develop at the right time.</p>
<p>The scientists studied the genetic material of a one-millimeter-long worm C. elegans which is commonly used for research. They studied two mutant strains of worms that displayed defects in the timing of activation of genetic programs during development. They wanted to identify the mutated genes in the worms and what the genes did.</p>
<p>After some time, they finally found that microRNA controlled the mutation. They also believe that this mutation has permitted organisms to change, or evolve, over hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Dr. Claire Fletcher is a cancer researcher with Imperial College London. Fletcher said the discovery of microRNA has opened new ways for treating cancer.</p>
<p>Fletcher said that microRNA provides genetic instructions that tell cells to make new proteins. “MicroRNA <strong>alters</strong> how genes in the cell work,” said Fletcher, who is not associated with the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>“We can take a microRNA that we know alters the activity of that gene and we can deliver that particular microRNA to cancer cells to stop that mutated gene from having its effect,” Fletcher added.</p>
<p>Last year's Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology was also awarded for developments related to RNA. Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman were recognized for discoveries that enabled messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccines for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is valued at about $1 million. Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes to recognize important discoveries that have aided humanity.</p>
<p>Thomas Perlmann is the Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee. He said it took a long time before Ruvkun came to the phone, but he was “happy, when he understood what it was all about.”</p>

            <title>Severe Obesity Increases in US (2024/10/8)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">07 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Body weight continues to be a big public health issue in the United States. New government research suggests that the condition of having far too much fat stored in the body – severe obesity – has increased greatly over the past ten years.</p>
<p>The U.S. obesity rate is about 40 percent, says a 2021-2023 study of about 6,000 people. Almost one in 10 of those questioned reported severe obesity, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found. Women were nearly two times as likely as men to report severe obesity.</p>
<p>The overall obesity rate appeared to decrease in comparison to the 2017-2020 survey. But the change was not considered <strong>statistically </strong>meaningful. In other words, the numbers are small enough that there is a mathematical chance the rates did not truly drop.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A subject's waist is measured during an obesity prevention study in Chicago on Jan. 20, 2010.

<p>Dr. Samuel Emmerich is the CDC public health officer who led the latest study. He said it is too soon to know whether new treatments for obesity, including weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound, can help ease the disease.</p>
<p>“We simply can't see down to that detailed level to <strong>prescription</strong> medication use and compare that to changes in obesity <strong>prevalence</strong>,” Emmerich said. He added, “Hopefully that is something we can see in the future.”</p>
<p>The results show that the overall obesity rate in the U.S. has not changed much in ten years. The rate of severe obesity climbed from almost eight percent in the 2013-2014 study to almost 10 percent in the most recent one.</p>
<p>Before that, obesity had increased quickly in the U.S. since the 1990s, federal studies showed.</p>
<p>Measures of obesity and severe obesity are based on the body mass index (BMI), a computation involving height and weight. People with a BMI of 30 are considered obese. Those with a BMI of 40 or higher have severe obesity.</p>
<p>Solveig Cunningham is an Emory University global health professor who specializes in obesity.</p>
<p>Cunningham said, “Seeing increases in severe obesity is even more alarming because that's the level of obesity that's most highly associated with some of the highest levels of <strong>cardiovascular </strong>disease and <strong>diabetes</strong> and lower quality of life.”</p>
<p>Cunningham, who was not involved in the new study, said it is not clear why rates of severe obesity are going up. Cunningham also said it is not clear why severe obesity rates were higher among women.</p>
<p>Reasons could include the effects of hormones, the effects of childbearing or other causes that require further study, she said.</p>
<p>The new study also found that obesity rates varied by education. Almost 32 percent of people with a bachelor's degree or higher reported having obesity. In comparison, about 45 percent of those with some college or less had obesity.</p>
<p>The new report follows the release earlier this month of data from U.S. states and territories that showed that in 2023, the rate of obesity differed widely by place.</p>
<p>The highest obesity levels were in West Virginia. Around 41 percent of adults in the state are obese.</p>
<p>The lowest levels were in Washington, D.C., with less than 24 percent of adults being obese.</p>
<p>Obesity rates were highest in the Midwest and the South.</p>
<p>All U.S. states and territories had obesity rates higher than 20 percent. In 23 states, more than 1 in 3 adults had obesity, the data showed. Before 2013, no state had a rate that high, said Dr. Alyson Goodman, who leads a CDC team focused on population health.</p>
<p>Color-coded maps show the obesity rates across the U.S.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, when you look at all that red, it's really discouraging,” Goodman said.</p>
<p>But, she added, recent attention on understanding obesity as a metabolic disease and new drug treatments give her hope.</p>
<p>Preventing obesity is most important, Cunningham said, starting in early childhood. And for people already dealing with obesity, preventing additional weight gain should be the goal.</p>

<p>A playhouse in London, Britain and a theater from Osaka, Japan, are working together to prove cultural differences between the two countries are only on the surface.</p>
<p>London's Charing Cross Theatre and Osaka's Umeda Arts Theater first worked together on a performance in 2019. After a break caused by the pandemic, they are jointly <strong>staging</strong> two plays in London this month. The plays are rooted in Japanese culture and deal with secretive relationships, but the concerns are universal.</p>
<p>Actor Susan Momoko Hingley spoke of Japan's export of culture, including films and television series. She told the Reuters news agency, "It's really about getting great stories from all sorts of different cultures to Britain and to the West."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Actors Susan Momoko Hingley and Mark Takeshi Ota perform in the production of " arts="" britain="" handout="" in="" london="" mark="" one="" reuters="" senior="" september="" small="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/97f2e708-09d8-4469-b08f-9ba0d885327d_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" step="" theater="" via=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Actors Susan Momoko Hingley and Mark Takeshi Ota perform in the production of "One Small Step" in London, Britain, September 27, 2024.

<p>She stars in <em>One Small Step,</em> written by Takuya Kato. It tells the story of a couple working for a company that is colonizing the moon. The plot becomes more complex with the news the woman is pregnant. It raises concerns <strong>audiences</strong> almost anywhere can relate to about motherhood, career and inequality between men and women.</p>
<p><strong>All about equality</strong></p>
<p>Kato, who is also the play's director, said, "In terms of equity, I think nowadays many people often say that we are <strong>striving</strong> for fairness within companies, within societies and between individuals."</p>
<p>"But I think it is something that we understand with our heads but might not necessarily <strong>grasp</strong> it with our hearts,” he added.</p>
<p>The London production, Kato said, gave new life to his play "at the <strong>intersection</strong> of two different cultures." He noted that for Japanese creative industries, the market within Japan may not be enough to support them. Working with companies in other countries helps the theater companies and expands knowledge of the culture.</p>
<p>"If we don't grow the part of coproductions, which we have traditionally struggled with, it would be difficult to survive as both an industry and culture in the future," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Second play to come</strong></p>
<p>Following <em>One Small Step</em>, which runs until October 9, Charing Cross Theatre will host <em>Tattooer </em>later in the month. The play, by another Japanese writer, Takuya Kaneshima, tells the story of a tattoo artist.</p>

            <title>Study: Replanting Same Trees Cannot Replace Burned Forests (2024/10/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Camille Stevens-Rumann recently sat on the ground and measured small trees to see how much they had grown in seven months.</p>
<p>She found they had grown five to 10 centimeters. Her team had planted several different kinds of trees, known as evergreens, two years ago in an area of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, which had burned in a fire in 2020.</p>
<p>Stevens-Rumann and other researchers want to learn the relationship between tree growth and <strong>elevation</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Colorado Forest Restoration Institute researcher at Colorado State University touches a test seedling in June 2024, in Bellvue, Colorado.

<p>Researchers say there are not enough small trees or seeds from living trees to replace burned trees. Even if there were enough, they say the U.S. does not have the workers to plant and care for them.</p>
<p>The Forest Service said the biggest delays they meet while replanting on public land are preparing environmental and cultural studies and preparing burned areas, so they are safe to plant. That can take years.</p>
<p>Stevens-Rumann said, "We're in a place of such <strong>drastic</strong> climate change that we are not talking about whether or not some of these places will be a different kind of forest, but whether or not they will be forests at all."</p>
<p><strong>Hotter fires</strong></p>
<p>In the past, the U.S. was able to replant burned forests. But the researchers say larger, more intense fires are destroying trees that normally provide seeds. They say the fires leave burn <strong>scars</strong> so large trees cannot naturally regrow.</p>
<p>Solomon Z. Dobrowski is a University of Montana forest management expert. He said more areas in the West need replanting after fires than can be replanted. He said at least 1.5 million hectares need to be replanted but officials are unable to do so. He said that number could <strong>triple</strong> by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted tree planting</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Hurteau is a forest ecologist at the University of New Mexico. He studied the way scarred forests had been replanted after a fire in 2011 at Los Conchas. That fire destroyed huge areas of ponderosa pine trees. Hurteau found most of the seedlings, or very young trees, had died from earlier replanting.</p>
<p>As a result, he planted seedlings of different <strong>species</strong> at several elevations and on hillsides facing different directions. Now he is watching carefully for changes in the soil and water.</p>
<p>Researchers say seedling survival is less likely at lower elevations. It is hotter, drier and more open there. Replanting the same trees in the same areas is likely to fail.</p>
<p>Jason Sieg is acting supervisor of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests &amp; Pawnee National Grassland. He said the Forest Service rules require planting the same species at the same elevations as before a fire. But, he said, it is clear the agency will "need to be <strong>flexible</strong> moving forward."</p>
<p>For now, that might mean replanting at different elevations or collecting seeds from another place. Over time, researchers say it could require planting trees that are not native to the area. The idea has been debated but is gaining support.</p>
<p>"I've seen people go from saying, 'Absolutely, we cannot move trees around' to, 'Well, let's maybe let's try it at least, and do a few experiments to see if this will work,'" said Stevens-Rumann.</p>
<p>Environmental groups are working on private land burned by the Cameron Peak fire. They are replanting ponderosa pines 150 meters higher than where they used to grow, said Megan Maiolo-Heath. Maiolo-Heath is a spokesperson for the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed.</p>
<p>So far, 84 percent of trees planted there last year are still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with replanting</strong></p>
<p>The Forest Service is modernizing how it grows young trees. It is also studying ways to grow more or work with private industry, states and groups like the New Mexico Reforestation Center.</p>
<p>Experts say trees might never return to some areas. But it is important that the U.S. does as much as possible in a thoughtful way.</p>
<p>"Trees live for hundreds of years so we need to be thinking about what's right as we plant trees today," Hurteau said.</p>

            <title>NASA Follows Asteroid Moving Closer to Earth from Sun’s Orbit (2024/10/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Scientists have discovered a small <strong>asteroid</strong> that recently moved closer to Earth's orbit. The object was first observed August 7 by two astronomers from Spain's Complutense University of Madrid.</p>
<p>The asteroid, named 2024 PT5, is believed to be about 10 meters long. It usually orbits around the sun. But Earth's gravitational forces recently pulled the object closer to our planet.</p>
<p>Scientists sometimes call such objects “mini-moons.” This is because they behave similarly to the permanent moon orbiting Earth when they are captured by gravity. But they are much smaller and only temporarily stay in Earth's orbit.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This file image shows a supermoon with a partial lunar eclipse rises over Lake Michigan in Chicago, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/e23bba79-51ea-4edd-8299-bfd781d42074_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This file image shows a supermoon with a partial lunar eclipse rises over Lake Michigan in Chicago, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2024.

<p>The American space agency NASA said <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2024/10/02/nasa-to-track-asteroid-2024-pt5-on-next-close-pass-january-2025/">in a statement</a> that 2024 PT5 is “not quite a mini-moon” because it will never be fully captured by Earth's gravity. However, it described the asteroid as “an interesting object” the agency plans to follow, or track, with radar-equipped telescopes. NASA noted the traveling asteroid presented no danger to Earth.</p>
<p>NASA and its international partners continuously search the skies for what scientists call near-Earth objects. Such objects include asteroids and <strong>comets</strong> that come within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit.</p>
<p>The search system, called ATLAS, involves four different telescopes. Two of the telescopes are based in Hawaii. Another operates in Chile and the other sits in South Africa. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://atlas.fallingstar.com/">explains</a> that ATLAS is designed to search the whole sky several times each night looking for moving objects.</p>
<p>2024 PT5 was identified by the telescope observing station in Sutherland, South Africa. The discovery was made by two astronomers from Complutense University of Madrid – Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos. They recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad781f">described</a> the find in the publication <em>Research Notes of the</em> <em>American Astronomical Society</em>.</p>
<p>The Spanish astronomers said it appeared 2024 PT5 is part of a group of near-Earth objects belonging to the Arjuna asteroid belt. The objects in this asteroid belt are believed to be “surrounding the path followed by the Earth-moon system,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Such objects are likely more common than we think, said Richard Binzel, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was not involved in the latest research.</p>
<p>Binzel told The Associated Press, “This happens with some <strong>frequency</strong>, but we rarely see them because they're very small and very hard to <strong>detect</strong>.” But he noted that in recent years, progress in space observation technologies had made it possible to identify more of these moon-like objects.</p>
<p>Binzel added that currently, it is not known whether the asteroid broke off from a larger asteroid. He said the space rock might even be a piece of our moon “that got <strong>blasted</strong> out.” NASA said such an asteroid could have been created by our moon being struck by an asteroid a very long time ago.</p>
<p>One of the discovering scientists, Carlos de la Fuente Marcos, told the AP in an email that because of its size and brightness, 2024 PT5 can only be seen from Earth with special equipment.</p>
<p>NASA said teams at the agency's Center for Near Earth Object Studies are continually tracking the movements of 2024 PT5. The center expects the asteroid to remain at a distance about nine times farther away from Earth than the moon. Scientists say it will remain gravitationally linked to Earth until November 25.</p>
<p>NASA plans to use its large Goldstone Solar System Radar observer to follow the asteroid. The object is set to make another close pass of Earth in January 2025, when it should stay about five times the distance between Earth and the moon. 2024 PT5 is then expected to turn away from Earth “as it continues its orbit around the sun,” NASA said.</p>
<p>After that, the asteroid is not expected to pass close by Earth until 2055.</p>

            <title>Japan’s Kojima Has History of Making Blue Jeans (2024/10/7)</title>

<p>In the Japanese town of Kojima, the main road is named Jeans Street.</p>
<p>This street is where people from around the world come to visit. The drink machines at the train station have images of <strong>jeans </strong>on them. The roads are painted blue, with the lines at the edges colored pink and white, the<strong> trademark </strong>of Kojima jeans' <strong>seams</strong>.</p>
<p>With about 40 jeans manufacturers and stores, including cafes, the area gets about 100,000 visitors a year, the Japan National Tourism Organization said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Shigeru Uchida, a weaver at Momotaro Jeans, holds a wooden shuttle next to a vintage loom machine in Kojima, Okayama prefecture, Japan, on Sept. 4, 2024.

<p>Japanese jeans are often costly, dark and <strong>durable</strong>. Although a small part of the global jeans market, Japanese jean makers have developed a <strong>reputation</strong> for quality and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Kojima is where popular <strong>brands </strong>like Big John are made. The city now supplies international clothing brands, including Gucci.</p>
<p>Emma McClendon of St. John's University in New York said that the Japanese industry has not taken a mass marketing path. Instead, the jean industry pays careful attention to creating quality products that collectors might like.</p>
<p>In Kojima, Jeans Street is small and uncrowded. Each company in the area is small, hiring about 100 people.</p>
<p>What you will find are workers taking pride in “monozukuri,” or “making things.” The term suggests careful attention to detail.</p>
<p>This idea can be found throughout Japan, from carmakers to the local tofu store.</p>
<p>“More like making a <strong>kimono</strong>” is the way Yoshiharu Okamoto, a <strong>dyeing craftsman</strong> at Kojima-based manufacturer Momotaro Jeans, puts it.</p>
<p>His hands and nails are colored blue from putting threads of cotton into a big container of coloring called dye.</p>
<p>He knows by smell and feel the right state of the indigo coloring, which he compares to a living thing. He says it is a 365-days-a-year job, as the dye has to be checked and mixed every day.</p>
<p>“It's not that easy to get this special color,” Okamoto told the Associated Press recently. “It's my life.”</p>
<p>The dark color is so special it has earned the name “Japan blue" or “tokuno blue,” meaning “especially <strong>concentrated</strong> blue.”</p>
<p>Jeans made in Kojima are costly. The jeans can cost from $230 per pair to $1,400 or more.</p>
<p>Thomas Stege Bojer is founder of Denimhunters, an online site for people who like jeans and the cotton material they are made out of — denim.</p>
<p>He says Japanese brands use “raw denim” that ages well and lasts a long time. He pointed to the jeans as part of a movement known as “slow clothing."</p>
<p>The idea is to produce fewer, but higher quality pieces of clothing. The movement came as a reaction to low-cost, mass-produced clothes.</p>
<p>“We just make too many clothes...I think, and we need to slow down,” Bojer said from his home near Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>McClendon said the Japanese industry is “shifting the <strong>conversation</strong> around jeans to be about <strong>heritage</strong> elements, about educating consumers on historical details as a form of quality.”</p>
<p>Momotaro Jeans, for example, come with a lifetime guarantee. Tears and other problems get fixed at no cost, within reason.</p>
<p>Japan Blue Co., which runs Momotaro, a brand that began in 2006, said yearly sales totaled about $11 million for the latest year. About 40 percent of sales come from outside Japan.</p>
<p>Masataka Suzuki, president and chief operating officer at Japan Blue, said the area has a strong industrial history.</p>
<p>In the past, industry centered around sewing heavy materials, including military clothes and obi sashes for kimonos, as well as the cotton and indigo-dyeing native to the area.</p>
<p>The jeans are for life, Suzuki said. The jeans slowly change depending on how they are worn and how the wearer lives.</p>
<p>“We want to create a product that is a<strong> testament</strong> to a person's life,” he said.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program, we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples, notes on usage, and sometimes, we use them in short conversations.</p>
<p>Today we talk about the sweet dish at the end of a meal -- the dessert. One of the most famous kinds of dessert is pie. With a <strong>buttery crust</strong> and sweet fillings like apple, berries, or banana cream, a well-made pie is a dreamy food, indeed.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This photo shows citrus pumpkin meringue pie in Concord, New Hampshire, October 12, 2015.

<p>And that gives us the expression <u>pie in the sky</u>.</p>
<p>Imagine a perfect pie coming down to you from the sky. That is like a dream. And a <u>pie in the sky</u> is a dream, too.</p>
<p>Anything described as<u> pie-in-the-sky</u> is fun to daydream about but is very unlikely to happen. When we act in a <u>pie-in-the-sky</u> manner, we are being <strong>foolishly optimistic</strong>.</p>
<p>Any industry or area of life can have <u>pie-in-the-sky</u> ideas. So, you can use this expression for different situations.</p>
<p>In business, let's say a company has lost money for two straight years. But the company chief promised increased earnings in the coming year. Her claims, as they say, were simply <u>pie in the sky</u>. She had no business plan or data to support them.</p>
<p>An unpublished writer may have <u>pie-in-the-sky</u> dreams about her book being turned into a multi-million dollar film project.</p>
<p>A teacher may have <u>pie-in-the-sky</u> wishes that all his students complete their homework on time.</p>
<p><u>Pies in the sky</u> are empty promises or empty wishes. They are wishful thinking. They are as unlikely as tasty pies falling from the sky.</p>
<p>American English has another similar expression: <u>pipe dream</u>. The expression is also used to describe a plan, hope, or wish that is highly unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>However, this expression does not come from a tasty <strong>bakery</strong>. Word experts say it started in <strong>opium dens</strong>. Here, people would smoke opium in long pipes and then fall into a dreamlike state where nothing seemed real.</p>
<p>Now let's hear two friends using the expressions <u>pipe dream</u> and <u>pie in the sky</u>.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, did you hear about Sarah? She's moving to Spain! </em></p>
<p><em>B: Really? Last week, she told me she was having trouble paying her <strong>rent</strong>. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, she told me this morning that she's moving to Madrid to open a bakery. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Sarah? Open a bakery? That sounds like a total <u>pie in the sky</u> to me. She can't even make toast.</em></p>
<p><em>A: You know, it sounded like <u>a pipe dream</u> when she told me. She didn't have details. Just a lot of dreamy talk. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, if she wants to turn her <u>pie-in-the-sky</u> bakery dream into a reality, I'd advise her to do one thing first – learn how to bake. </em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>Spanish scientist Pilar Bosch has found a way to use bacteria to repair 18th-century paintings.</p>
<p>Bosch, a microbiologist, tells Reuters she got the idea for the method while considering possibilities for a paper toward her doctoral degree. During this process, she discovered someone else's paper that suggested bacteria can be used to <strong>restore</strong> artworks.</p>
<p>At around the same time, Bosch learned that her mother was struggling to find a good method for restoring 18th-century paintings. The paintings, by Spanish artist Antonio Palomino, sat in Santos Juanes – one of the oldest <strong>churches</strong> in the city of Valencia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Jose Luis Regidor, restorer and director of the project, joins Pilar Roig Picazo and Pilar Bosch Roig for a picture at the Church of Santos Juanes, in Valencia, Spain, September 16, 2024.

<p>Bosch said her mother, Pilar Roig, noted how difficult the restoration process at the church was. One reason was the <strong>glue </strong>used to remove the paintings from the walls in the 1960s. The substance was nearly impossible to remove completely.</p>
<p>"My mother had a very difficult problem to solve and I found a paper about bacteria used to clean frescoes in Italy," Bosch said. A fresco is a kind of painting that often appears across a large wall.</p>
<p>Bosch added she decided to write her doctoral paper on the same subject. That was more than ten years ago. Today, she gets to work with her mother on the church restoration. They are using the bacteria method to remove glue from artworks. The $4.46 million project is being financed by local organizations.</p>
<p>The process involves feeding small amounts of the glue – made from animal collagen – to the bacteria. After a time, the bacteria begins to naturally produce enzymes to break down the glue.</p>
<p>The mother-daughter team then mixes the bacteria with a natural algae-based substance, called a gel, and places it onto the paintings. They say that after about three hours, the gel mixture is removed, leaving the paintings glue-free.</p>
<p>Bosch's mother, now 75, noted that in the past, restorers of artworks had to use traditional cleaning methods that "took hours and damaged the painting." She noted that several other relatives in the family also work in art restoration. Bosch agreed, saying the work "certainly runs in the family."</p>
<p>Bosch has also used her bacteria removal process in other restoration projects in Italy and Spain. And, she is now training other scientists to use a different kind of bacteria to clear walls of painted <strong>graffiti</strong>.</p>

<p>
<em>Our story today is called "A Municipal Report." It was written by O. Henry and first published in 1904. Here is Shep O'Neal with the story.</em></p>
<p>It was raining as I got off the train in Nashville, Tennessee -- a slow, gray rain. I was tired so I went straight to my hotel.</p>
<p>A big, heavy man was walking up and down in the hotel lobby. Something about the way he moved made me think of a hungry dog looking for a bone. He had a big, fat, red face and a sleepy expression in his eyes. He introduced himself as Wentworth Caswell -- Major Wentworth Caswell -- from "a fine southern family." Caswell pulled me into the hotel's barroom and yelled for a waiter. We ordered drinks. While we drank, he talked continually about himself, his family, his wife and her family. He said his wife was rich. He showed me a handful of silver coins that he pulled from his coat pocket.</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/4d1679b4-84c6-4de2-929e-448ae4c5044c_w100_r1.png"/></div>
<p>By this time, I had decided that I wanted no more of him. I said good night.</p>
<p>I went up to my room and looked out the window. It was ten o'clock but the town was silent. "A nice quiet place," I said to myself as I got ready for bed. Just an ordinary, sleepy southern town."</p>
<p>I was born in the south myself. But I live in New York now. I write for a large magazine. My boss had asked me to go to Nashville. The magazine had received some stories and poems from a writer in Nashville, named Azalea Adair. The editor liked her work very much. The <strong>publisher </strong>asked me to get her to sign an agreement to write only for his magazine.</p>
<p>I left the hotel at nine o'clock the next morning to find Miss Adair. It was still raining. As soon as I stepped outside I met Uncle Caesar. He was a big, old black man with fuzzy gray hair.</p>
<p>Uncle Caesar was wearing the strangest coat I had ever seen. It must have been a military officer's coat. It was very long and when it was new it had been gray. But now rain, sun and age had made it a <strong>rainbow</strong> of colors. Only one of the buttons was left. It was yellow and as big as a fifty cent coin.</p>
<p>Uncle Caesar stood near a horse and carriage. He opened the carriage door and said softly, "Step right in, sir. I'll take you anywhere in the city."</p>
<p>"I want to go to eight-sixty-one Jasmine Street," I said, and I started to climb into the carriage. But the old man stopped me. "Why do you want to go there, sir? "</p>
<p>"What business is it of yours?" I said angrily. Uncle Caesar relaxed and smiled. "Nothing, sir. But it's a lonely part of town. Just step in and I'll take you there right away."</p>
<p>Eight-sixty-one Jasmine Street had been a fine house once, but now it was old and dying. I got out of the carriage.</p>
<p>"That will be two dollars, sir," Uncle Caesar said. I gave him two one-dollar bills. As I handed them to him, I noticed that one had been torn in half and fixed with a piece of blue paper. Also, the upper right hand corner was missing.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair herself opened the door when I knocked. She was about fifty years old. Her white hair was pulled back from her small, tired face. She wore a pale yellow dress. It was old, but very clean.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair led me into her living room. A damaged table, three chairs and an old red sofa were in the center of the floor.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair and I sat down at the table and began to talk. I told her about the magazine's offer and she told me about herself. She was from an old southern family. Her father had been a judge.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair told me she had never traveled or even attended school. Her parents taught her at home with private teachers. We finished our meeting. I promised to return with the agreement the next day, and rose to leave.</p>
<p>At that moment, someone knocked at the back door. Azalea Adair whispered a soft apology and went to answer the caller. She came back a minute later with bright eyes and pink cheeks. She looked ten years younger. "You must have a cup of tea before you go," she said. She shook a little bell on the table, and a small black girl about twelve years old ran into the room.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair opened a tiny old purse and took out a dollar bill. It had been fixed with a piece of blue paper and the upper right hand corner was missing. It was the dollar I had given to Uncle Caesar. "Go to Mister Baker's store, Impy," she said, "and get me twenty-five cents' worth of tea and ten cents' worth of sugar cakes. And please hurry."</p>
<p>The child ran out of the room. We heard the back door close. Then the girl screamed. Her cry mixed with a man's angry voice. Azalea Adair stood up. Her face showed no emotion as she left the room. I heard the man's rough voice and her gentle one. Then a door slammed and she came back into the room.</p>
<p>"I am sorry, but I won't be able to offer you any tea after all," she said. "It seems that Mister Baker has no more tea. Perhaps he will find some for our visit tomorrow."</p>
<p>We said good-bye. I went back to my hotel.</p>
<p>Just before dinner, Major Wentworth Caswell found me. It was impossible to avoid him. He insisted on buying me a drink and pulled two one-dollar bills from his pocket. Again I saw a torn dollar fixed with blue paper, with a corner missing. It was the one I gave Uncle Caesar. How strange, I thought. I wondered how Caswell got it.</p>
<p>Uncle Caesar was waiting outside the hotel the next afternoon. He took me to Miss Adair's house and agreed to wait there until we had finished our business.</p>
<p>Azalea Adair did not look well. I explained the agreement to her. She signed it. Then, as she started to rise from the table, Azalea Adair <strong>fainted</strong> and fell to the floor. I picked her up and carried her to the old red sofa. I ran to the door and yelled to Uncle Caesar for help. He ran down the street. Five minutes later, he was back with a doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor examined Miss Adair and turned to the old black driver. "Uncle Caesar," he said, "run to my house and ask my wife for some milk and some eggs. Hurry!"</p>
<p>Then the doctor turned to me. "She does not get enough to eat," he said. "She has many friends who want to help her, but she is proud. Mrs. Caswell will accept help only from that old black man. He was once her family's <strong>slave</strong>."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Caswell." I said in surprise. "I thought she was Azalea Adair."</p>
<p>"She was," the doctor answered, "until she married Wentworth Caswell twenty years ago. But he's a hopeless drunk who takes even the small amount of money that Uncle Caesar gives her."</p>
<p>After the doctor left I heard Caesar's voice in the other room. "Did he take all the money I gave you yesterday, Miss Azalea?" "Yes, Caesar," I heard her answer softly. "He took both dollars."</p>
<p>I went into the room and gave Azalea Adair fifty dollars. I told her it was from the magazine. Then Uncle Caesar drove me back to the hotel.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I went out for a walk before dinner. A crowd of people were talking excitedly in front of a store. I pushed my way into the store. Major Caswell was lying on the floor. He was dead.</p>
<p>Someone had found his body on the street. He had been killed in a fight. In fact, his hands were still closed into tight <strong>fists</strong>. But as I stood near his body, Caswell's right hand opened. Something fell from it and rolled near my feet. I put my foot on it, then picked it up and put it in my pocket.</p>
<p>People said they believed a thief had killed him. They said Caswell had been showing everyone that he had fifty dollars. But when he was found, he had no money on him.</p>
<p>I left Nashville the next morning. As the train crossed a river I took out of my pocket the object that had dropped from Caswell's dead hand. I threw it into the river below.</p>
<p>It was a button. A yellow button...the one from Uncle Caesar's coat.</p>

            <title>Obviously and Apparently (2024/10/5)</title>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Martha about the usage of two adverbs commonly used in spoken English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3391f298-20c9-41e5-832c-c2614fac2c5b_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>I'm wondering if you could help me [explain] the difference between “obviously” and “apparently.”</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Martha</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Martha. I'm happy to answer this question.</p>
<p>Let's look at the adjective form of these words first.</p>
<p>If something is “obvious,” that means it is easy to see or understand. For example, it is obvious that an elephant is bigger and heavier than a dog. But some things are only obvious if you have enough experience or knowledge. For example, if a car needs fixing, it may be obvious to a skilled worker what repairs are needed. But the repairs might not be obvious to a person who lacks experience with cars.</p>
<p>The adjective “apparent” also describes something that is easy to see or understand. But we probably use the word “apparent” less often than the word “obvious.” “Apparent” can sound a little more <strong>formal</strong> than “obvious” in some situations.</p>
<p>Both “obvious” and “apparent” can be followed by the preposition “to” plus an object pronoun, as in the following examples:</p>
<p><em>It's obvious to me that he is unhappy.</em></p>
<p><em>It was apparent to him that no one in the office had the right skills for the job. </em></p>
<p>Next, let's look at the adverbial forms: “obviously” and “apparently.”</p>
<p>Unlike the adjective forms, these two words differ in terms of how easily we can understand or know something.</p>
<p>When we use the word “apparently,” we are expressing the idea that we think we know something is true. However, this idea is usually based on information we have heard or read rather than our own direct experience.</p>
<p>For example, if you say, “Apparently, he's not a very good teacher,” that means you have heard reports that the person is not a good teacher. At the same time, you do not know for sure if it is true. That is because you do not have direct experience yourself with the teacher.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you say, “He's obviously not a very good teacher,” that means you have—or think you have—enough information to be sure that you are correct. It also means you think others should easily understand or agree with what you are saying.</p>
<p>We can use “obviously” or “apparently” as the first word in a sentence, followed by a comma, as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>Obviously, we need to practice more if we want to improve.</em></p>
<p><em>Apparently, it's hard to find a good restaurant in that area. </em></p>
<p>We can also place these adverbs next to the verb:</p>
<p><em>She apparently needs a lot of help.</em></p>
<p><em>He obviously feels very strongly about this issue. </em></p>

            <title>Argentine Town Struggles with Parrot Invasion (2024/10/4)</title>

<p>The Argentine town of Hilario Ascasubi near the country's Atlantic coast has a problem not many places have ever had.</p>
<p>It has too many parrots.</p>
<p>Biologists say thousands of the green-yellow-and-red birds have invaded the town. These experts say deforestation has driven the birds' migration.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Parrots stand on an switch box and cables in the town of Hilario Ascasubi in Argentina on September 23, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>The problem is that the birds bite the town's electric <strong>cables</strong>. This is causing electricity outages. People living in the town are also unhappy about the birds' noise making and the birds' droppings, or waste that is getting everywhere.</p>
<p>Daiana Lera is a biologist. She said much of Argentina's forestland has been lost over the years. As a result, the parrots are going into the cities.</p>
<p>“The hillsides are disappearing, and this is causing them to come closer to the cities to find food, shelter and water,” Lera said.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the parrots have started to arrive in the autumn and winter to seek refuge. Local people say, at times, there are up to 10 parrots for each of the town's 5,000 human <strong>inhabitants</strong>. Only during the summer do the birds migrate south to the <strong>cliffs</strong> of Patagonia for <strong>breeding</strong> season.</p>
<p>Images show hundreds of birds <strong>perched</strong> on electric cables, buildings and churches.</p>
<p>Ramón Alvarez is a local reporter for Radio Taxi Fm. About the parrots, he said, “They bite and damage the cables, water can get into the wires when it rains....”</p>
<p>That affects Alvarez directly. “It goes without saying that when the power goes out, there is no radio,” he said.</p>
<p>The locals have tried different methods to scare away the birds, such as noise and even laser light. But nothing has worked.</p>
<p>“We need to start to restore our natural environments,” Lera said. “But until that happens, we have to think of strategies that allow us to live together in the most <strong>harmonious</strong> way possible in our towns.”</p>

<p>Edgar Tapia works on the Homeless Outreach Team of San Francisco, California. He goes to places where people are living in the streets and tells them there is space for them in city shelters. He recently went into one San Francisco neighborhood on that mission.</p>
<p>He came to a group of <strong>tents</strong>, calling out greetings and offers of food and water bottles. He asked if anyone was interested in moving indoors. He had eight available beds in city shelters, he told them.</p>
<p>He reminded them that city street cleaners would be coming soon to clear the sidewalk.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Members of the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team talk to a homeless person in the Mission District, Sept. 10, 2024, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Terry Chea)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/16a0d647-15c6-4b64-8e48-439e2b26e5b1_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Members of the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team talk to a homeless person in the Mission District, Sept. 10, 2024, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Terry Chea)</span></div>
<p>One woman in a tent asked for health care kits and clothing. "Can we get some <strong>socks</strong>?" she asked.</p>
<p>Finding people to enter the city shelter is not an easy job. There are more shelter beds than ever before. San Francisco's <strong>mayor, </strong>London Breed, has said she will no longer permit people living outdoors when they know there is a place to stay indoors.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to stay on the street</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a person wants to move inside, but there are no beds. Other times, a bed is open but the person refuses the offer. Reasons include use of drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>But outreach workers keep trying.</p>
<p>Jose Torres is a Homeless Outreach Team <strong>manager</strong>. He said that people on the street sometimes want to stay with their friends or dislike the shelter.</p>
<p>"Sometimes we get lucky and they accept the one thing we have available, and if that doesn't work, we try something else," he said. "It's that 'try again, try again' system."</p>
<p>Tapia was happy because a man he had been talking to for two months said he may be ready to accept a place in a shelter. The first time they talked, Tapia said, the man asked no questions and showed little interest. But the next time, the man asked what the shelters were like.</p>
<p>Tapia said, "I want to see these people off the streets. I want to see them do good."</p>
<p>The 41-year-old woman who asked for socks said her name was Mellie M. She said her group wants hotel rooms or an apartment. She wants a secure place to stay because she was raped while homeless.</p>
<p>"In order for us not to live in tents anymore," she said, "they need to give us a place that we can call home."</p>
<p>When Torres, the manager, arrived in one neighborhood, he got good news from other outreach workers. They told him that a <strong>client</strong> was moving into his own small apartment. That client is 71-year-old Larry James Bell.</p>
<p>Outreach worker Ventrell Johnson got emotional thinking about Bell. Just eight months ago, Bell was living under a plastic sheet. Johnson had gotten Bell a bed in a homeless shelter. Now, Bell was ready for his own place.</p>
<p>"I'd like to have a house one day," Bell said.</p>
<p>When Bell leaves the shelter, another bed becomes available for someone else. Johnson noted that people are a little more likely to accept shelter beds; now the city is pushing to remove the tents and temporary shelters from the streets.</p>
<p>By the end of their workday, outreach workers had found seven people for seven shelter beds.</p>

<p>For VOA Learning English, this is <em>Everyday Grammar</em>.</p>
<p>Today we are going to talk about different ways of expressing quantity in English.</p>
<p>A <strong>quantifier </strong>is a word or number that shows an amount or number. You probably already know how to use common quantifiers like <em>much</em> and<em> many</em>. For example:</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/80470000-c0a8-0242-8421-08daad1f2a99_cx2_cy0_cw97_w100_r1.png"/></div>
<p><em>How many apples would you like?</em></p>
<p><em>How much fruit would you like?</em></p>
<p>The quantifier<em> many</em> is used before <em>apples</em>, which is a <strong>count noun</strong>. <em>Much</em> is used before <em>fruit</em>, a <strong>noncount noun</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure you understand the difference between <strong>count nouns </strong>and <strong>noncount nouns </strong>before you study quantifiers. You can learn about count and noncount nouns in <a class="wsw__a" href="/preview/en-US-LEARN/a/3193621.html">last week's episode of Everyday Grammar</a>.</p>
<p>Quantifiers are adjectives and adjective phrases that go before nouns. They give information about <em>how much</em> or <em>how many</em> of an item you are talking about. Some quantifiers, like <em>many,</em> go only before count nouns. Others, like <em>much,</em> go only before noncount nouns. And a few quantifiers can go before count or noncount nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers only used with count nouns</strong></p>
<p><em>One, each </em>and<em> every</em> are examples of count noun quantifiers.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>One movie that I enjoy is “The Godfather.”</em></p>
<p><em>Each child is special.</em></p>
<p><em>Every member of the country club is rich.</em></p>
<p>With plural count nouns, just add <em>of the</em> between the quantifier and the noun it describes.</p>
<p><em>One of the boys is from China.</em></p>
<p><em>Each of the cars has air conditioning.</em></p>
<p><em>Every one of the students is smart.</em></p>
<p>Notice that <em>boys, cars</em> and<em> students</em> are plural nouns. But the verbs that follow them are singular. In most situations, <em>one, each and every</em> make the subject singular, even if the subject contains a plural noun.</p>
<p>This tricky rule confuses native speakers and English learners alike.</p>
<p>There are a few quantifiers related to the number <em>two</em>. You can say <em>I have two shoes</em>, <em>I have a couple of shoes, I have both shoes, </em>and<em> I have a pair of shoes</em>.</p>
<p>If you have more than two countable items, you can use <em>several, a few, many </em>and<em> a number of</em>.</p>
<p><em>I have several <strong>assignments</strong> due this week.</em></p>
<p><em>There are a few Thai restaurants in my town.</em></p>
<p><em>There are many ways to practice English.</em></p>
<p><em>A number of the cars are imported.</em></p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers only used with noncount nouns</strong></p>
<p>Now let's move on to quantifiers that only work with noncount nouns: <em>a little, much </em>and<em> a great deal of</em>. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em>Could you loan me a little money?</em></p>
<p><em>The old woman has much wisdom to share.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a great deal of oil in Saudi Arabia.</em></p>
<p><em>Little</em> can go before a count noun if it is used as an adjective. For example, “The little boy is playing.” In this example,<em> little</em> does not refer to a number or quantity; it refers to the size of the boy.</p>
<p><strong>Quantifiers used with both count and noncount nouns</strong></p>
<p>There are several “safe” quantifiers that can go with both count and noncount nouns. <em>Some</em> is the most popular. <em>Most, plenty of, all </em>and <em>any </em>are other <strong>options</strong>. Listen for the quantifiers in these examples:</p>
<p><em>He cut some wood. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>Most Americans speak English. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>I have plenty of money. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>All children are special. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>Do you have any coffee? (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p>To refer to the<strong> absence </strong>or <strong>lack of</strong> something, simply use <em>no</em> before a count or noncount noun.</p>
<p><em>There was no rice left. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>There were no books in the library. (count noun)</em></p>
<p><em>She had no love for her ex-husband. (noncount noun)</em></p>
<p><em>No, when used as a quantifier, has the same meaning as zero.</em></p>
<p><em>Lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> are very popular quantifiers — maybe too popular. Some English teachers do not like them. They think that <em>lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> are overused and <strong>unsophisticated</strong>. You should avoid <em>lots </em>and<em> a lot of</em> in formal writing. Native speakers usually shorten <em>a lot of </em>to<em> “</em>a lotta” in casual speech.</p>
<p><strong>Few/a few vs. little/a little</strong></p>
<p>Listen carefully to these two sentences:</p>
<p><em>I have a few friends.</em></p>
<p><em>I have few friends</em>.</p>
<p>What is the difference? The first sentence contains the article <em>a</em>. This little word makes a big difference in meaning.</p>
<p><em>I have a few friends</em> <strong>focuses</strong> on a positive idea. The speaker is satisfied with the number of friends he has. The second sentence, <em>I have few friends</em>, focuses on a <strong>negative</strong> idea, his lack of friends. The speaker wishes he had more friends.</p>
<p>It might help to think of<em> few</em> as a half-empty glass of water. <em>A few</em> is like a half-filled glass of water. The amount of water is the same. But the speaker's attitude about the amount of water is different. <em>Few </em>and<em> a few</em> are only used before count nouns.</p>
<p>The same <strong>positive</strong>-negative <strong>distinction </strong>applies to <em>a little </em>and<em> little</em>. Use <em>little</em> and<em> a little</em> before noncount nouns.</p>
<p><em>I have a little money means the speaker has some money.</em></p>
<p><em>I have little money means the speaker does not have enough money.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of <em>little</em>, we have <em>little</em> time left for today's program. We hope you learned a few tips about how to use quantifiers.</p>

            <title>Everest Growing Taller than Expected (2024/10/3)</title>

<p>Mount Everest, standing 8.85 kilometers above sea level, is Earth's tallest mountain.</p>
<p>And Mount Everest is still growing.</p>
<p>Mount Everest and the rest of the Himalayas are continuing on an upward movement that began at their birth around 50 million years ago. The mountains are a product of a collision between Eurasia and the Indian subcontinent.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Mount Everest or Sagarmatha (top), the highest peak in the world with an altitude of 8.848 meters is seen in this aerial view next to Mount Ama Dablam (bottom R) on April 22, 2007.

<p>But Everest is growing more than expected. And, scientists now think they know the reason why.</p>
<p>Everest's growth has to do with the major joining, or merger, of two nearby river systems. The Kosi river joined with the Arun river around 89,000 years ago, the researchers estimated.</p>
<p>This change in the area's river system has led to Everest gaining around 15-50 meters in height.</p>
<p>That suggests an upward movement rate of about 0.2-0.5 millimeters per year.</p>
<p>The geological process at work, researchers said, is called isostatic rebound.</p>
<p>Isostatic rebound involves the rise of land masses on Earth's <strong>crust</strong> when the weight of the surface declines. The crust, Earth's outermost part, floats atop hot, semi-liquid rock.</p>
<p>In this case, the joining of the rivers resulted in increased <strong>erosion</strong> which carried off large amounts of rock and soil. This reduced the weight of the area near Everest.</p>
<p>"Isostatic rebound can be likened to a floating object adjusting its position when weight is removed," said Jin-Gen Dai of China University of Geosciences in Beijing.</p>
<p>Dai is one of the leaders of the study published recently in Nature Geoscience.</p>
<p>"When a heavy load, such as ice or eroded rock, is removed from the Earth's crust, the land beneath slowly rises in<strong> response</strong>, much like a boat rising in water when cargo is unloaded," Dai added.</p>
<p>The researchers, who used numerical models to study the development of the river system, estimated that isostatic rebound accounts for about 10 percent of Everest's yearly upward movement, or uplift rate.</p>
<p>This geological process is seen in other places around the world.</p>
<p>"A classic example is in Scandinavia, where the land is still rising in response to the melting of thick ice sheets that covered the <strong>region</strong> during the last Ice Age. This process continues today, affecting coastlines and landscapes, thousands of years after the ice retreated," Dai said.</p>
<p>Study co-writer Adam Smith, a University College London doctoral student, said GPS measurements show the continued rising of Everest and the rest of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>This uplift is faster than the continued surface erosion caused by wind, rain and river flow. As this erosion continues, Everest's uplift rate from isostatic rebound may increase, Smith said.</p>
<p>Neighboring mountains, including Lhotse, the world's fourth highest, and Makalu, the fifth highest, also get a boost from the same process. Lhotse is experiencing an uplift rate similar to Everest. Makalu has a slightly higher uplift rate.</p>
<p>Dai said that the research shows our planet's changing nature. Even a seemingly unchanging element like Mount Everest is "subject to ongoing geological processes, reminding us that Earth is constantly changing, often in ways<strong> imperceptible</strong> in our daily lives."</p>
<p>Earth's rigid outer part is divided into large plates that move slowly over time. The Himalayas rose following a collision between two plates.</p>
<p>Everest is located on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It was named for George Everest, a 19th century British <strong>surveyor</strong> in India.</p>
<p>"Mount Everest occupies a <strong>unique</strong> place in human consciousness," Dai said.</p>
<p>"Physically, it represents Earth's highest point," giving it a lot of importance simply because of its size, Dai explained.</p>
<p>He added that Everest has cultural importance to local Sherpa and Tibetan communities. Worldwide, Dai said, the mountain represents a big test for human endurance.</p>

            <title>Short Corn Is Growing Stronger in US Midwest (2024/10/3)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/short-corn-is-growing-stronger-in-us-midwest.mp3"/>

<p>Fields of tall corn plants are a common thing to see in the Midwest United States in late summer. They are as much a part of rural America as big red <strong>barns</strong> and cows.</p>
<p>But soon, tall corn plants might become shorter, replaced by plants only half as tall.</p>
<p>Cameron Sorgenfrey is a farmer in the Midwestern state of Iowa. He has been growing newly developed short corn for several years. His neighbors sometimes have questions about his smaller corn plants.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cameron Sorgenfrey holds a tall corn stalk next to a short corn stalk along one of his fields, Monday, Sept. 16, 2024, in Wyoming, Iowa.

</span></div>
<p><strong>Changing agriculture</strong></p>
<p>"As you drive across the Midwest, maybe in the next seven, eight, 10 years, you're going to see a lot of this out there," Sorgenfrey said. “I think this is going to change agriculture in the Midwest," he added.</p>
<p>Bayer Crop Science developed the short corn and tested it on 12,141 hectares in the Midwest. One promise the company made to farmers was a kind of corn that could survive powerful windstorms. The corn is not only shorter, but it also has a larger base. It can withstand winds of up to 80 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>The smaller plants can grow closer together than taller kinds. That means farmers can grow more corn on the same amount of land, which increases their profits. This will help farmers facing lower corn prices in recent years. The smaller plants could also lead to less water use.</p>
<p>Dior Kelley is an assistant professor at Iowa State University. She is researching different possibilities for growing shorter corn. She said that because corn is the largest crop in the United States, more widespread use of the small kind will have a large effect.</p>
<p><strong>Huge difference</strong></p>
<p>"It is huge. It's a big, <strong>fundamental</strong> shift," Kelley said.</p>
<p>Last year, American farmers grew more than 363 million metric tons of corn. Most was used for animal feed, the fuel additive ethanol, or exported to other countries.</p>
<p>Scientists have long tried to develop better kinds of corn plants. But it has become more important for corn to grow even in very hot weather or when there is a lack of rain. Strong winds are another danger. In August 2020, a strong windstorm in the Midwest caused $11 billion in damage. It flattened both trees and corn plants only weeks before harvest time.</p>
<p>Kelley said she likes the idea of short corn. But she warns that short plants have their own problems to consider. For example, corn cobs that grow closer to the soil could be more at risk to diseases or mold.</p>
<p>Brian Leake is a Bayer spokesperson. He said the company has been developing short corn for more than 20 years. In a few years, he hopes farmers will be growing short corn everywhere.</p>

            <title>Stair-climbing: A Sure Way to Burn Calories (2024/10/2)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>If you are trying to lose weight, climbing <strong>stairs</strong> as a regular exercise might be for you.</p>
<p>Stairs are available in many places. And research shows stair-climbing is more effective than walking on level ground.</p>
<p>“Overall, it is a fact that stair-climbing gets you fit faster and <strong>consumes</strong> more <strong>calories</strong>,” said Lauri van Houten, vice president of the International Skyrunning Federation. The organization oversees a number of activities that involve climbing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this photo provided by ISF/Meeting, runner Yuri Yoshizumi competes during a race of Stairclimbing World Championships in Osaka, western Japan, on Nov. 19, 2023. (ISF/MEETING via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a5dd6596-206c-4b2f-90a3-272760d69d07_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - In this photo provided by ISF/Meeting, runner Yuri Yoshizumi competes during a race of Stairclimbing World Championships in Osaka, western Japan, on Nov. 19, 2023. (ISF/MEETING via AP)</span></div>
<p>“How many calories will I burn is the question everyone wants to know,” van Houten said. “Here's the good news: The overall energy <strong>expenditure</strong> of the exercise depends on your weight. Therefore, the more you weigh, the more you burn,” she said.</p>
<p>Research shows you burn about 20 times more calories going up stairs than walking on flat ground. Even going down stairs, you burn around five times more because your muscles have to work to slow the body.</p>
<p>That might be all you need to know if you are trying to lose weight.</p>
<p>Dr. Alberto Minetti of Italy's University of Milan has done a large amount of research on human movement — including stair-climbing. It is an exercise everyone can do and does not cost money, he said.</p>
<p>Minetti did the math to explain why going up stairs is so effective for burning calories in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>“To move 1 kilogram of body mass over one <strong>horizontal </strong>meter, you expend 0.5 calories,” he said.</p>
<p>But, he added, “If you move 1 kilogram of body mass <strong>vertically</strong> on stairs it's 10 calories. So it's 20 times the calories moving vertically rather than horizontally.”</p>
<p>Trained as a doctor, Minetti has spent his career as a researcher. He suggested that older people and beginner stair climbers watch their speed.</p>
<p>Minetti does his own stair-climbing at his home in Milan. He said he often takes a few deep breaths before going up the many stairs.</p>
<p>In a scientific study, Minetti makes the point that using your arms in stair-climbing adds extra power. <strong>Handrails</strong> offer safety, too.</p>
<p>The study notes that handrails are available along most stairs in very tall buildings. Using them increases “the muscle mass involved..." by getting the arms involved, the study shows.</p>
<p>“They are relatively small muscles in the arms, but better than nothing,” Minetti said.</p>
<p>If stair-climbing were an Olympic sport, Australian Suzy Walsham would own gold medals.</p>
<p>She has won 10 races up New York City's Empire State Building — officially 1,576 stairs — and five climbs up the Eiffel Tower. Overall, Walsham has won more than 100 international stair races, and was once considered the top woman in the sport.</p>
<p>When she was living in Singapore, Walsham climbed up her 29-story building — 37 times straight. It took over four hours with short breaks for coffee or water. She covered a vertical distance of 3,200 meters.</p>
<p>Walsham told the Associated Press that stair-climbing is a good form of exercise for many kinds of people.</p>
<p>“Many people struggle to run as they age,” she said, noting the exercise is “harder on the joints.”</p>
<p>She said stair training is a great substitute for running.</p>
<p>Stairs are everywhere — one flight, two flights at home, inside very large buildings, in stadiums, at work, in shopping malls, in the subway.</p>
<p>Stair-climbing does not take much time. It is easy to build up, adding a few flights of stairs every day or week. Stair-climbing can also help improve balance.</p>
<p>And it can easily become part of an exercise plan.</p>
<p>Yuri Yoshizumi won last year's women's division of the Stairclimbing World Championships in her native Osaka, Japan. She completed the 285-meter climb — 1,610 stairs — in 10 minutes, 20.06 seconds.</p>
<p>“Stair-climbing is an easy sport for beginners and the general public to get into,” Yoshizumi told the Associated Press in an email. She said the exercise helps to “strengthen your muscles and your cardiovascular system in a short amount of time.”</p>
<p>Yoshizumi noted that cities usually have many public stairways for people to climb.</p>
<p>“Just using the stairs instead of the <strong>escalators</strong> at (subway) stations and department stores is a good way to get some exercise,” she said.</p>

<p>Elections officials across Pennsylvania have begun testing their voting machines using a method known as <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong> testing. It will be important to know how the machines will perform under the pressure of the hard use they will experience during the election.</p>
<p>All election equipment used by Pennsylvania <strong>counties</strong> is put through this pre-election “stress test.” A stress test is a way to find out how something performs under pressure.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law requires all its counties to conduct logic and accuracy testing before any election. All other states do similar testing.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Voting equipment at the Allegheny County Election Division is prepared to be moved to polling sites.Thursday, Nov. 3, 2022.

</span></div>
<p>Forrest Lehman is director of elections and registration in one Pennsylvania county. "Really, we are testing the voting system end to end," he said. "It's almost like we're running a small-<strong>scale</strong> election."</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>During logic and accuracy testing, election officials create <strong>sample</strong> ballots. Some of these are made to fail or cause errors in the machines. The officials put the samples through the machines to make sure they are counting votes accurately and noting errors.</p>
<p>Mark Lindeman is director of policy and strategy at Verified Voting, a group that studies voting technology in the U.S. He said that “logic and accuracy testing, combined with post-election <strong>audits</strong> of the voted ballots” show that “voting machines are doing what they're supposed to do.”</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for Election Day</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania counties have until 15 days before the election to confirm that they have completed the logic and accuracy test.</p>
<p>County officials must tell the heads of local political parties when and where they are doing the testing. The Pennsylvania Department of State says counties should also notify the public. The public can choose to observe the testing.</p>
<p>Snyder County Director of Elections Devin Rhoads said his county's testing is set to begin in October and finish in three days.</p>
<p>Rhoads said anybody who wants to watch Snyder County's testing is welcome.</p>
<p>"We're open and <strong>transparent</strong>," Rhoads said. "If I have a person who is questioning or doesn't believe in the system,” he says, he will show them how it works.</p>
<p>Other county election officials say they will run their tests over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>After the testing, officials reset the machines and keep them in a secure location until they go out to the voting places for Election Day.</p>
<p><strong>All eyes on Pennsylvania, other swing states</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania is considered an important swing state in this year's presidential election. A swing state is a state where candidates from the nation's two main political parties share similar levels of support among voters. This year, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and former Republican President Donald Trump are both seeking to win Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes.</p>
<p>Election Day in the U.S. this year is November 5.</p>

            <title>Use Habit Stacking to Help Get Healthy (2024/10/1)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">30 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>A woman in Portland, Oregon started her daily exercise <strong>habit</strong> with one activity – walking her dog. Lindsay Kee then added movements to this daily activity. Before leaving on the walk, she did some standing stretches. On her return, she did other exercises such as <strong>jumping jacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Over time, Kee added more exercises around the dog walk. She said adding exercises to an existing activity took the pressure off of creating a whole new daily exercise. And now more than a year later, she <strong>consistently</strong> exercises around the dog walk.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Habit stacking could be walking a pet and listening to news, a book, or podcast. Here a woman looks at her device while walking her dogs in a park in Tallinn, Estonia, Dec 16, 2020.(AP Photo/Raul Mee)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/196bc8da-45e6-42da-85f2-616f61a2223c_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Habit stacking could be walking a pet and listening to news, a book, or podcast.

<p>Kee said, “I've found it to be really effective in helping me be consistent with things that I really do want to do.”</p>
<p>What Kee did is called habit <strong>stacking</strong>. Writer S.J. Scott created this term for his 2014 book of the same name. The idea behind habit stacking is to attach something you want to start doing to something you already do every day.</p>
<p>A common example is <strong>flossing</strong> your teeth after brushing them. However, you can use habit stacking in many areas of your daily life. Kee, for example, places her <strong>vitamins</strong> next to the coffee machine. This helps her remember to take them every morning.</p>
<p>Exercise experts say habit stacking is especially helpful if you are trying to increase exercise time.</p>
<p>Dana Santas is a movement expert who has trained more than 50 professional sports teams. She combines exercise habits with personal health care. For example, Santas does <strong>push-ups</strong> before every <strong>shower.</strong> And she does leg exercises while brushing her teeth. She says that her electric toothbrush makes a sound every 30 seconds to remind her to brush different teeth. But she uses the reminder to change her exercises. “It's perfect,” she added.</p>
<p>Two minutes of exercise may not get you in shape. But, experts say every little bit helps. Experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest getting 150 minutes of <strong>moderate</strong> activity, like a fast walk, every week. Or you could also get 75 minutes of very energetic<strong> </strong>activity, like jogging, every week. The health experts also suggest two days a week of strength training.</p>
<p>Most people find keeping new habits difficult. And while habit stacking is not a perfect solution, it does help with one barrier -- decision-making.</p>
<p>Gretchen Rubin is the writer of <em>Better Than Before: Mastering the Habits of Our Everyday Lives</em>. She said habit stacking is one of the best ways to start and keep new habits. The technique helps to remove the barrier of deciding when or if to do something.</p>
<p>Rubin shared a story of her college days. To help her stay active, she would only shower if she had exercised that day.</p>
<p>She suggested combining the new, or what she calls “shaky,” behavior with something you have to do or deeply want to do.</p>
<p>“So you have to do the <strong>shaky</strong> habit before you get to the strong habit,” Rubin said. If she wants to listen to a podcast, her strong habit, she must do it while exercising on a running machine. For her, this will strengthen her shaky habit.</p>

            <title>Pennsylvania Bakery Is Ready with Election Cookie Poll (2024/10/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>People are driving from hours away to buy cookies at Lochel's Bakery outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And orders for its red and blue cookies are coming in from as far away as the American state of Alaska.</p>
<p>They come to<strong> </strong>buy the 10-centimeter round cookies in blue and white showing the name of the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. Or, they want the red and white cookies with the name of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>These are not your everyday cookies. At Lochel's Bakery, the sale of each Harris 2024 or Trump 2024 cookie counts as a vote for the candidate. The candidate with the most cookies sold is considered the winner of its “cookie <strong>poll</strong>.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Cookies, with Harris and Trump labels on, are on display at Lochel's Bakery in the town of Hatboro in suburban Philadelphia, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>The sale of cookies and the cookie poll began in the 2008 presidential election as a joke between the bakery owners and their <strong>customers</strong>. The cookie poll correctly predicted Barack Obama as the winner in 2008 and 2012 and Trump as the winner in 2016. But in 2020, more customers bought cookies named after Trump, who lost that year's election to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Kathy Lochel is one of the bakery's owners. She said the cookie poll is meant to be fun. “It's definitely not scientific. It's just a... way... to take the pressure off with what is going on with the election,” Lochel added.</p>
<p>Helene Moran recently bought Trump cookies on her 82nd birthday. Moran said she bought each time Trump ran for election. “He's my sweetheart, I love him so much,” she said.</p>
<p>Lochel said the bakery is selling even more cookies this year than in 2020. “These cookies are being shipped all over the United States right now, so much so that they're on <strong>back order</strong>, so we're about three to four weeks back,” Lochel said.</p>
<p>It helps that Lochel's Bakery is in the moderate and heavily populated <strong>suburbs</strong> of Philadelphia. The bakery is also in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, where support for Trump and Harris is evenly split among voters. Whichever candidate wins more battleground states will likely win this year's election.</p>
<p>The sale of Trump cookies may have increased after he shared a story about the cookie poll on social media. As of September 24, Trump was leading Harris in cookie sales, 12,558 to 889 — a far bigger lead than real election polls of likely voters have found.</p>
<p>Lochel says that while the real election includes attack advertising and name-calling, the cookie-buying public has been much nicer.</p>
<p>“The people that are coming into our store, whether they're buying red or blue cookies, they're friendly, they joke, they laugh, they buy other things,” Lochel said.</p>

            <title>A Century of Changes As Jimmy Carter Turns 100 (2024/10/1)</title>

<p>Former president of the United States Jimmy Carter is turning 100 on October 1.</p>
<p>The 39th president is celebrating the century mark at his home in Plains, Georgia, where he was born in 1924. He is currently in <strong>hospice </strong>care.</p>
<p>Carter's small southern town is much like it was when he was a boy. But America, and the world overall, has seen major changes over his long life.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Former President Jimmy Carter teaches Sunday School class at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown, Aug. 23, 2015, in Plains, Ga. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/af220553-de37-4fd0-bc3e-87fa5f6bb33c_cx0_cy15_cw91_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Former President Jimmy Carter teaches Sunday School class at Maranatha Baptist Church in his hometown, Aug. 23, 2015, in Plains, Ga. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>Changes everywhere, but not Plains</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. population is almost three times larger than it was in 1924. America grew from about 114 million people to about 330 million today. The world population grew even faster, from 1.9 billion to more than 8.1 billion, during the same period.</p>
<p>That great increase has not reached Plains, Georgia, however. The town of 500 people in the 1920s, now has closer to 600. Much of its local economy revolves around Carter, its most famous son.</p>
<p><strong>Red state, blue state</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Carter first ran for president in 1976 against then-President Gerald Ford. That election marked the first time the television network NBC started using a red-and-blue electoral map to cover the election results.</p>
<p>The colors have since become a permanent part of the American political language. The color blue represents the Democratic Party and red represents the Republican Party.</p>
<p><strong>Shopping</strong></p>
<p>In 1924, there was no Amazon to order goods online. But Americans could order a build-it-yourself house from a Sears <strong>catalog</strong> for $2,025. That amount was a little below the average worker's yearly earnings.</p>
<p>There was no <strong>superstore</strong> like Walmart. But people could buy bread, milk, and other things at small, local general stores.</p>
<p>Prohibition, the ban on making and drinking alcohol, had been national law for four years when Carter was born. He was nine when it ended.</p>
<p>The former president and his late wife Rosalynn were not known as big drinkers. They usually served <strong>wine</strong> as the single kind of alcoholic drink at White House state dinners, mainly to save money. Other kinds of alcohol would increase the cost of the events.</p>
<p>But Carter's brother Billy was known for his beer drinking. When Carter became president, Billy sold his name to a beer manufacturer to produce Billy Beer. News sources reported that Billy Carter received a $50,000 yearly payment for use of his name from one brewer. That would be about $215,000 in today's economy.</p>
<p><strong>Voting rights </strong></p>
<p>The 19th Amendment that extended voting rights to women went into effect in 1920, four years before Carter's birth. And the Voting Rights Act that widened voting rights to Black Americans was passed in 1965.</p>
<p>Now, Carter is set to vote by mail for Vice President Kamala Harris, says his grandson Jason Carter. He added that his grandfather is <strong>excited</strong> about the chance to see Harris make history.</p>
<p>If elected, Harris would become the first female and the first person of South Asian ancestry to lead the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Immigration and isolationism</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Carter was born in a period of <strong>isolationism</strong>, protectionism and white Christian nationalism in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 1922, Congress enacted taxes on imports, called tariffs, to help U.S. manufacturers. After stock market losses in 1929, lawmakers added more tariffs to help farmers.</p>
<p>Five months before Carter was born, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Act of 1924. The law created the U.S. Border Patrol and sharply limited immigration, permitting mostly just Western Europeans to enter. Asians were barred from the country completely.</p>
<p>Congress said the law was meant to “<strong>preserve</strong> the<strong> ideal</strong> of U.S. <strong>homogeneity</strong>.” The militant white supremacist group Ku Klux Klan held large marches in Washington in 1925 and 1926 to gather support.</p>
<p>A century later, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is promising to order the largest <strong>deportation</strong> effort in U.S. history if he wins office.</p>
<p>Trump is also calling for tariffs on all goods coming to America.</p>
<p><strong>Other presidents </strong></p>
<p>Carter has lived through 40 percent of U.S. history since the Declaration of Independence in 1776. When Carter took office, just one president, John Adams, had lived to be 90. Since then, Ford, Ronald Reagan, Carter and George H.W. Bush all reached at least 93.</p>

            <title>Study: Water Sources on Moon More Widespread than Thought (2024/9/30)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A new study suggests sources of water on the moon are more widespread than previously thought.</p>
<p>The study was based on new examinations of data collected by India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. It launched in October 2008 and collected data while orbiting the moon for about a year.</p>
<p>Chandrayaan-1 has already provided evidence of water on the moon. In September 2009, scientists published a study based on data from the Indian space mission. The data showed the presence of molecules linked to water, as well as the substance hydroxyl.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this early Monday, Oct. 5, 2020, file photo, a waning moon is seen at the sky over Frankfurt, Germany. (AP Photo/Michael Probst, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/ea29b6fd-92d5-4daf-8385-3c3f941ced79_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this early Monday, Oct. 5, 2020, file photo, a waning moon is seen at the sky over Frankfurt, Germany.

<p>The American space agency NASA describes hydroxyl (OH) as “a molecule made up of one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom with a free (unpaired) electron.” It notes it is “one of the most reactive gases in the atmosphere” and can help break down other gases in the air.</p>
<p>The 2009 study suggested the water molecules identified by Chandrayaan-1 data were mainly found in the moon's extreme northern and southern areas, known as the poles. Scientists said the data from that study showed most of the water probably existed in large <strong>craters</strong> near the poles where sunlight is blocked.</p>
<p>But new examinations of the data show that water and hydroxyl molecules likely exist over much wider areas of the moon. In addition, the research suggests water is even present in areas of the moon receiving direct sunlight.</p>
<p>The instrument aboard Chandrayaan-1 that captured the molecule data is called the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3). NASA built and operated the instrument. The space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=2008-052A-04">describes</a> M3 as an “imaging spectrometer.” A spectrometer is an instrument used to study the chemical <strong>composition</strong> and structures of substances.</p>
<p>On the Chandrayaan-1 mission, the spectrometer aimed to map the mineral composition of materials on the moon's surface. Researchers examined this data and centered their search on areas outside the lunar poles. They found that the sources of water and hydroxyl are believed to be contained in minerals on or just below the moon's surface.</p>
<p>Scientists involved in the research recently reported their results <a class="wsw__a" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ad5837">in a study</a> published in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The research was led by Roger Clark, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute.</p>
<p>In a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.psi.edu/blog/sources-of-water-and-hydroxyl-are-widespread-on-the-moon/">press release</a> announcing the findings, the researchers noted their discovery was made possible by data that the M3 instrument collected. They explained the instrument provides highly detailed data using imaging and infrared technologies.</p>
<p>The M3 instrument, for example, can identify 85 different colors in its examinations of mineral compositions. This compares to normal digital cameras, which generally only record three colors.</p>
<p>The researchers said, “Just like we see different colors from different materials, the infrared spectrometer can see many (infrared) colors to better determine the composition, including the water and hydroxyl."</p>
<p>The team noted the water might have resulted from heating of rocks and soil or from chemical reactions that combined different hydroxyls to produce water, as well as oxygen.</p>
<p>Clark, from the Planetary Science Institute, said both cratering and volcanic activity can bring water-rich materials to the surface. He noted that both are observed in the newly examined data. “We see a lunar surface with complex <strong>geology</strong> with <strong>significant</strong> water in the sub-surface and a surface layer of hydroxyl.”</p>
<p>The discovery, Clark said, can be helpful to future exploration efforts on the moon. “Future astronauts may be able to find water even near the equator by <strong>exploiting</strong> these water-rich areas.”</p>
<p>He added, “Knowing where water is located not only helps to understand lunar geologic history, but also where astronauts may find water in the future.”</p>
