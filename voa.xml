        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Scientists Find Energy Jets Among the Universe’s Largest Structures (2024/9/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/scientists-find-energy-jets-among-the-universe-s-largest-structures.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Mario Ritter, Jr.</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">25 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Scientists say they have found the largest <strong>jets </strong>of energy ever observed shooting out of a black hole in a distant galaxy.</p>
<p>The jets extend 23 million light years from end to end. That is about 140 times the width of our Milky Way Galaxy. The galaxy responsible is estimated to be 7.5 billion light years from Earth.</p>
<p>The scientists observed the structures using the Low-Frequency Array, or LOFAR, radio telescope network centered in the Netherlands.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated image provided by Caltech, taken by Europe's LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) radio telescope, shows the longest known pair of black hole jets, as reported in the journal Nature. (LOFAR Collaboration/Martijn Oei/Caltech via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/d50af00e-c5a9-4342-81cb-cefac8ae9099_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">This undated image provided by Caltech, taken by Europe's LOFAR (LOw Frequency ARray) radio telescope, shows the longest known pair of black hole jets, as reported in the journal Nature. (LOFAR Collaboration/Martijn Oei/Caltech via AP)</span></div>
<p>Violent, highly energetic events around a black hole in the galaxy are the cause of the jets. A black hole is often the remains of a super-massive star that collapses. It is so massive that even light cannot escape its powerful gravity.</p>
<p>Researchers have named the energy jets Porphyrion after a giant in ancient Greek <strong>mythology</strong>. Porphyrion is 30 percent longer than any other known energy jet.</p>
<p>Martijn Oei of Caltech is an <strong>astrophysicist</strong> and lead writer of the study published in <em>Nature</em>. Oei said, “Jet systems like Porphyrion appear to be among the most energetic <strong>spectacles</strong> that have occurred in the universe since the Big Bang.”</p>
<p>The Big Bang is the event that scientists say marked the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>Astrophysicist Martin Hardcastle of the University of Hertfordshire in English was also a writer of the study. He explained how scientists believe the jets formed.</p>
<p>“The general understanding is that jets are formed when magnetized material falls onto a <strong>rotating</strong> black hole,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the jets “need to be sustained by a continued infall of matter into the black hole, something on the order of one solar mass (the mass of the sun) a year of material.”</p>
<p>However, although they are huge, the jets cannot be seen in visible light. Scientists used radio telescopes to find them. They start small and grow over time, the scientists say.</p>
<p>“We've known for a while that black holes can <strong>generate</strong> these jets. But what is interesting is that to generate a large structure like this, the jets must stay on for a long time — about a billion years,” Hardcastle said.</p>
<p>The Porphyrion jets reach far beyond their home galaxy. Their total output of energy is equal to trillions of stars like the sun.</p>
<p>Oei said that amount of energy is similar to when two <strong>clusters</strong> of galaxies crash into one another, each containing thousands of galaxies.</p>
<p>Hardcastle said the discovery could increase knowledge of magnetic fields in the universe.</p>
<p>He said: “The fact that it extends so far from its parent black hole means that it may be carrying energy, particles and magnetic fields into the <strong>voids</strong> in the cosmic web...”</p>
<p>Such jets also could heat up gas in interstellar space, suppressing the formation of new stars or could damage planets that could hold life, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Scientists say our Milky Way Galaxy has a black hole at its center, but it does not have a jet, and it is not active.</p>
<p>However, the researchers noted that the most important finding of the study might be that black holes can create some of the largest structures in the universe.</p>
<p>“This means that individual black holes can have a sphere of influence that extends way beyond the galaxy in which they <strong>reside</strong>,” Oei added.</p>

            <title>New California Laws Aim to Prevent AI Harm during Elections (2024/9/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/new-california-laws-aim-to-prevent-ai-harm-during-elections.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">25 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>California recently enacted three legislative measures that ban the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create false images and videos during election campaigns.</p>
<p>The laws – which are among the strongest in the U.S. – aim to reduce the use of AI to produce <strong>fake</strong> materials that could mislead voters during elections. California Governor Gavin Newsom <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/17/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-combat-deepfake-election-content/">signed</a> the bills into law last week.</p>
<p>One of the main goals of the California measures is to fight the use of so-called deepfakes. A deepfake is a piece of video or audio created to make it appear that people in it are saying or doing things that they never said. Deepfakes have already been used in political campaigns around the world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks at the opening ceremony for Panda Ridge, the new exhibit at the San Diego Zoo, Aug. 8, 2024, in San Diego.

Gavin Newsom speaks at the opening ceremony for Panda Ridge, the new exhibit at the San Diego Zoo, Aug. 8, 2024, in San Diego. (AP Photo/Derrick Tuskan, File)</span></div>
<p>One of the laws requires large online publishers to either remove or identify content that has been digitally created or changed in an effort to mislead voters during specific election periods.</p>
<p>Another requires any election advertisements that have been created or changed using AI methods to include a message informing the public that the material has been changed.</p>
<p>The third bill bans the publishing of certain kinds of misleading information about campaign activities within 120 days of an election.</p>
<p>All the California measures permit state law enforcement officials to take different forms of action against violators of the laws.</p>
<p>In a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/17/governor-newsom-signs-bills-to-combat-deepfake-election-content/">statement</a> issued after he signed the bills, Newsom said the measures were aimed at “safeguarding the <strong>integrity</strong> of elections.” He added, “It's critical that we ensure AI is not deployed to <strong>undermine</strong> the public's trust through disinformation – especially in today's <strong>fraught</strong> political climate.”</p>
<p>State lawmakers in several other U.S. states have passed similar measures in recent years to prevent deepfakes and misinformation during election campaigns. But critics argue that the laws are difficult to enforce and face numerous legal actions aimed at overturning them.</p>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) reports two of the new California measures immediately faced legal action seeking to block the legislation. One of the lawsuits argues that one of the measures <strong>censors</strong> expressions of free speech and permits anyone to take legal action against material they do not agree with.</p>
<p>That lawsuit was brought by an individual who created <strong>parody</strong> videos that received public attention online. This included changed audio of Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. At least one of the creator's videos was shared by Elon Musk, who owns the social media service X.</p>
<p>The governor's office told the AP the law does not ban <strong>satire</strong> and parody content. Instead, it requires material changed through AI methods to be clearly identified in videos, audio or images. A spokesman for Newsom, Izzy Gardon, said in a statement, “It's unclear why this conservative activist is suing California.” Gardon added that California's measure is nearly the same as laws passed in other states.</p>
<p>But critics – such as free speech activists and Musk – have called the new laws unconstitutional. They have argued they violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which protects speech and other personal freedoms.</p>
<p>Ilana Beller is with Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that seeks to protect individual rights. She told the AP she does not know how effective such laws will be in stopping election deepfakes. Beller noted her group closely follows U.S. measures related to deepfakes and none of them have yet been tested in court.</p>
<p>Some technology experts warn that the laws' effectiveness could be limited by the slow process of court actions. Misleading content, including deepfakes, might not be removed before harm has been done, the experts say. Even if it only takes a court a few days to act against such material, candidates and the election process may have already been hurt, Beller said.</p>

            <title>Alcohol-free Beer Becomes More Popular in Germany  (2024/9/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The head brewmaster for Weihenstephan, the world's oldest <strong>brewery</strong>, has a secret.</p>
<p>The secret is that he really likes to drink alcohol-free beer.</p>
<p>Tobias Zollo is quick to say that he enjoys real beer more. Still, the expert brewer says he enjoys alcohol-free beer when he is working.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Head Brewmaster Tobias Zollo poses behind non alcoholic beer at the Weihenstephan brewery in Freising, Germany, Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/d9f66d8c-3f43-412d-ada9-beeedfd2e5f4_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Head Brewmaster Tobias Zollo poses behind non alcoholic beer at the Weihenstephan brewery in Freising, Germany, Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)</span></div>
<p>Alcohol-free beer has the same taste as usual beer but has fewer calories, he said.</p>
<p>The caloric reduction is a result of the brewery's process of evaporating the alcohol.</p>
<p>“You can't drink beer every day — unfortunately,” he joked recently at the Bavarian state brewery in the German town of Freising, located about 31 kilometers north of Munich.</p>
<p>Zollo is not alone in his enjoyment for alcohol-free beer. The drink has been gaining popularity in recent years as interest in the alcoholic version decreases.</p>
<p>Christian <strong>monks</strong> established Weihenstephan as a brewery in 1040. The operation began to produce non-alcoholic wheat beer and lager in the 1990s. Now those non-alcoholic drinks account for 10 percent of its total beer production. The same is true, generally, across Germany's beer industry.</p>
<p>“The people are unfortunately — I have to say that as a brewer — unfortunately drinking less beer,” Zollo said recently. He spoke the day before the start of Oktoberfest, a 16-day celebration held yearly in Munich.</p>
<p>Zollo said that if there is a way to offer a choice that has “the <strong>crisp</strong> and fresh taste from a<strong> typical</strong> Weihenstephan beer, but just as a non-alcoholic version, we want to do that.”</p>
<p>Celebrants can choose that version at all but two of the 18 large tents at the event. The alcohol-free beer will cost the same as an alcoholic beer.</p>
<p>Oktoberfest celebrant Mikael Caselitz of Munich seemed to approve of the drink choices.</p>
<p>“For people who don't like to drink alcohol and want to enjoy the Oktoberfest as well, I think it's a good <strong>option</strong>,” he said.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old continued, “Sometimes people feel like they have more fun with alcohol, which is not a good thing because you can also have fun without alcohol...If you want to come and drink alcohol-free beer, nobody will judge you.”</p>
<p>Oktoberfest began in the early 1800s.</p>
<p>This year marked the first time an alcohol-free beer garden opened in Munich. “Die Null,” which means “the zero” in German, served non-alcoholic beer and other alcohol-free drinks near the city's main train station this summer.</p>
<p>Walter Ko<i></i>776;nig is managing director of the Society of Hop Research. He said researchers have had to create special<strong> hops</strong> for alcohol-free beer. If brewers use the usual hops for alcohol-free beer, the special smell gets lost when the alcohol is reduced during the brewing process.</p>
<p>But alcohol-free beer buyers do not care about that, Ko<i></i>776;nig said recently as he prepared for Oktoberfest. He explained, “They only want to know that what they are tasting is as good as traditional beers with alcohol."</p>

            <title>US Colleges Cut Programs Because of Budget Deficits, Fewer Students (2024/9/25)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Christina Westman hoped to become a music <strong>therapist</strong> when she came to St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. But that became impossible when the college announced a plan to cut its music department along with 42 other study programs.</p>
<p>The move is part of a wave of program cuts among small and large colleges in the United States. The aim of the cuts is to deal with budget deficits. Causes for the deficits include less government money, rising operational costs and fewer students.</p>
<p>The cuts mean more than reduced budget deficits or job losses. “For me, it's really been <strong>anxiety-ridden</strong>,” said Westman. "It's just the fear of the unknown.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="University student Christina Westman poses at St. Cloud State University, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in St. Cloud, Minn.

<p>At St. Cloud State, most students will be able to finish their degrees before the cuts. But Westman is <strong>transferring</strong> to Augsburg University in Minneapolis.</p>
<p><strong>Colleges are holding on</strong></p>
<p>For years, many colleges avoided making cuts, said Larry Lee. He was acting president of St. Cloud State but left last month to lead Blackburn College in Illinois.</p>
<p>The number of students <strong>enrolling</strong> in college dropped during the pandemic. But officials hoped the number would return to levels that existed before the COVID pandemic. They had used federal aid money to ease budget deficits.</p>
<p>“They were holding on, holding on,” Lee said.</p>
<p>The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center said students have begun to return to two-year community colleges. But the numbers for four-year colleges remain lower than expected. Even without growing concerns about the high cost of college and student debt, the population of young adults in the U.S. is shrinking.</p>
<p>Birth rates fell during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and never recovered. Now smaller classes of high school students are preparing to finish and head off to college.</p>
<p>“It's very difficult math to overcome,” said Patrick Lane, a vice president at the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education.</p>
<p>In addition, the new federal government's financial aid application has created more <strong>confusion</strong>. Millions of students are wondering where to go to college and how to pay for it.</p>
<p>Katharine Meyer is an expert with the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution. She said, “I think a lot of colleges are really concerned they're not going to make their enrollment targets.”</p>
<p>Many colleges like St. Cloud State had already faced budget problems. The university's enrollment rose to around 18,300 students in the autumn of 2020 before steadily falling to about 10,000 students in 2023. Its student population has stopped shrinking. But the budget deficit totaled $32 million over the past two years, forcing the sweeping cuts, Lee said.</p>
<p><strong>Some colleges are closing</strong></p>
<p>Some colleges have taken the more extreme step of closing.</p>
<p>That happened at the 1,000-student Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama, the 900-student Fontbonne University in Missouri, the 350-student Wells College in New York, and the 220-student Goddard College in Vermont.</p>
<p>Cuts, however, are more common. Two of North Carolina's public universities in Asheville and Greensboro plan to cut 14 programs including ancient Mediterranean studies and physics. Arkansas State University announced it was ending nine programs. Three of the 64 colleges in the State University of New York system have also cut programs because of low enrollment and budget problems.</p>
<p>Other schools cutting study programs include West Virginia University, Drake University in Iowa, the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney, North Dakota State University and nearby Dickinson State University.</p>
<p>Experts say it is just the beginning. Schools that are not making cuts now are examining their class offerings. At Pennsylvania State University, officials are looking for similar or under-enrolled programs to cut.</p>
<p><strong>Humanities and small programs affected</strong></p>
<p>The most affected programs are usually smaller ones and those in the humanities, which now have fewer students than 15 years ago.</p>
<p>“It's a humanitarian disaster for all of the <strong>faculty</strong> and <strong>staff</strong> involved, not to mention the students who want to pursue this stuff,” said Bryan Alexander, a Georgetown University senior scholar who has written on higher education. “It's an open question to what extent colleges and universities can cut their way to <strong>sustainability</strong>.”</p>
<p>Terry Vermillion recently retired after 34 years as a music professor at St. Cloud State. He said the cuts are hard to watch after the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We were just unable to really effectively teach music online, so there's a <strong>gap</strong>,” he said. “And, you know, we're just starting to come out of that gap and we're just starting to rebound a little bit. And then the cuts are coming.”</p>
<p>Lilly Rhodes is a music major at St. Cloud State. Rhodes said, “There's no musicians coming in, so when our seniors graduate, they go on, and our <strong>ensembles</strong> just keep getting smaller and smaller.”</p>
<p>“It's a little difficult to keep going if it's like this,” she added.</p>

            <title>Federal Bureau of Investigation: Rate of Violent Crimes in US Down in 2023 (2024/9/25)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Violent crime decreased in the United States in 2023, a new report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation says.</p>
<p>The FBI released its report Monday. The report shows violent crime dropped an estimated three percent in 2023 from the year before. Murders dropped almost 12 percent.</p>
<p>Here is what the Associated Press (AP) said about the FBI report:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An FBI seal is seen on a wall on Aug. 10, 2022, in Omaha, Neb. Violent crime in the US dropped again in 2023, according to FBI statistics. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6b1f8b33-934e-4814-863d-23a51b656a27_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An FBI seal is seen on a wall on Aug. 10, 2022, in Omaha, Neb. Violent crime in the US dropped again in 2023, according to FBI statistics. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)</span></div>
<p><strong>The numbers</strong></p>
<p>Crime increased sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, with <strong>homicides</strong> increasing by nearly 30 percent in 2020 from the year before. That was the largest one-year increase since the FBI began keeping records. Experts said possible reasons for the rise include the huge <strong>disruption</strong> of the pandemic, gun violence, worries about the economy and intense <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
<p>The FBI data show that, in 2022, violent crime across the U.S. decreased to levels near those before the pandemic. Crime continued to decrease last year from 377 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2022 to 364 per 100,000 people in 2023. Deputy Assistant Director Brian Griffith of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division said that rate is a little higher than the 2019 rate.</p>
<p>“Are we looking at crime rates at a return to pre-pandemic levels? I think a reasonable person would look at that and say, ‘Yes, that's what has happened,'” Griffith told the AP.</p>
<p>The largest cities, those with populations of one million or more, recorded the biggest drop in violent crime at almost seven percent. Agencies in communities of 250,000 to almost 500,000 people reported an increase of .3 percent, between 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>Rape decreased more than nine percent while <strong>aggravated assault</strong> decreased nearly three percent. Overall, property crime decreased two percent, but automobile stealing increased 13 percent. There were about 319 motor vehicle thefts per 100,000 people in 2023. That was the largest increase since 2007.</p>
<p><strong>The FBI's data is not complete</strong></p>
<p>The FBI collects data through its Uniform Crime Reporting Program. Not all law enforcement agencies in the U.S. take part in the reporting. The 2023 report is based on data from more than 16,000 agencies, or more than 85 percent of those agencies in the FBI's program. The agencies included in the report protect almost 316 million people across America. And every agency with at least one million people in its <strong>jurisdiction</strong> provided a full year of data to the FBI, the report said.</p>
<p>“What you're not seeing in that number are a lot of very small agencies," Griffith said.</p>
<p><strong>Another crime report</strong></p>
<p>The FBI's findings are similar to the findings of the independent, nonprofit group, Council on Criminal Justice based in Washington, D.C. Earlier this year, it examined crimes rates across 39 U.S. cities. The group said that most violent crimes are at or below 2019 levels. It said that there were 13 percent fewer homicides across 29 cities that provided data during the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.</p>
<p>Another Justice Department report, the National Crime Victimization Survey, was released earlier this month. It said that the violent crime victimization rate rose from about 16 per 1,000 people in 2020 to 22.5 last year. The report said that the rate last year was not <strong>statistically</strong> different from the rate in 2019. It said the rate has dropped a lot since the 1990s.</p>
<p>The FBI report and the Crime Victimization Survey use different study methods and collect different kinds of information.</p>
<p>The victimization survey is carried out every year. It questions about 240,000 people. The FBI's data only includes crimes reported to police. The victimization study aims to record crimes that people did not report to police.</p>
<p>The victimization survey does not include data on murder or crimes against children under 12 years old.</p>

            <title>Reservoir in Poland Praised for Blocking major Flooding (2024/9/25)</title>

<p>A <strong>reservoir</strong> in Poland built to prevent flooding is being praised for doing its job well after major floodwaters hit the area.</p>
<p>The anti-flood reservoir, called the Lower Raciborz Reservoir, sits on the Oder River. It is near the Polish cities of Opole and Wroclaw.</p>
<p>The project was first imagined in 1997, when the “flood of the century” hit the two cities, causing major damage. Work was completed on the water body in 2020.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by the state company Polish Waters shows the Oder River flood waters channeled into the newly-built Lower Raciborz Reservoir in Raciborz, southwestern Poland, Sept. 23, 2024.

<p>Over the past week, heavy rains have created major floodwaters across central Europe. Officials in Poland have struggled to keep waters from flowing out of the Oder River into nearby communities. The Associated Press reported the flooding across central Europe killed at least 24 people.</p>
<p>But people living in Opole and Wroclaw are now crediting the reservoir with saving the areas from severe flooding and destruction. Locals told the AP that the reservoir successfully flattened a huge wave created by the flooded Oder.</p>
<p>Some people who remembered the 1997 flood disaster watched carefully to see whether the newly finished reservoir would effectively do its job. And it did.</p>
<p>The reservoir's performance led to some public attention on social media. Some individuals gave the water body honorable names. These included “National Hero,” "King of Gold” and "Raciborz Reservoir the Great.” Other social media messages suggested the reservoir should be named after Poland's famous football goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.</p>
<p>The anti-flood reservoir was built following <strong>lessons</strong> learned from the severe flooding of 1997. The project took about $520 million to build. Part of the money came from the European Union and World Bank. Two villages had to be resettled to complete the reservoir.</p>
<p>When it opened in 2020, the water body covered 26 square kilometers of wildland. It can hold up to 185 million cubic meters of floodwater.</p>
<p>People living in Opole and Wroclaw said the Oder reached extreme heights. But, they said, the reservoir caught the floodwaters. Water never flowed out into the streets.</p>
<p>Some areas not covered by the reservoir system suffered heavy flooding.</p>
<p>Last week, European Union chief Ursula van der Leyen promised the EU would provide billions of dollars in aid to affected communities in Central Europe. Among other nations suffering severe flood destruction are Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.</p>

            <title>Ways to Protect Yourself from Injures while Walking Your Dog (2024/9/24)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Over the past 20 years, injuries related to dog walking have been on the rise among adults and children in the U.S., Johns Hopkins University researchers say.</p>
<p>The most common kinds of injuries include broken bones, <strong>sprains</strong> and head <strong>trauma</strong>.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2020, the estimated number of adults treated for dog-walking injuries at emergency departments increased from 7,300 to 32,300 a year. That comes from lead researcher Ridge Maxson who spoke to the Associated Press.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Susannah Johnston, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., walks her dog Ellie on Sept. 8, 2024 in Norfolk, Conn.

<p>Of those patients, 75 percent were women. Forty-seven percent were adults between ages 40 and 64.</p>
<p>But that information is only for visits to emergency rooms. Maxson said many people might seek treatment at other healthcare centers for their injuries, including at primary care, specialty or urgent care <strong>clinics</strong>.</p>
<p>He noted that dog ownership has become increasingly common in the United States with about half of households having at least one dog.</p>
<p><strong>How to protect yourself </strong></p>
<p>Safe dog walking involves careful attention and, in some cases, special equipment. That can be especially true in bad weather conditions.</p>
<p>However, multitasking — doing several tasks at once — can be dangerous. That includes using your mobile phone while doing something else.</p>
<p>“You can't really afford to<strong> relax</strong> when you walk a powerfully built dog...You have to pay attention,” said Noel Holston, a dog owner in Athens, Georgia.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, Holston was walking his 30-kilogram dog in a park near his home when a large bird made a noise. His dog did what dogs often do and ran after the bird. That pulled Holston off the sidewalk.</p>
<p>“I stepped into a hole and heard my left ankle snap. The pain was so intense. I almost passed out,” said Holston who is now 76 years old.</p>
<p>Running with a leashed dog is another risk no matter how well trained you think your dog is. The activity is especially dangerous with a dog that is easily surprised or very young. That is what happened to Robert Godosky in New York City.</p>
<p>“My dog...was relatively new to us. He <strong>got spooked</strong> and got in front of me, and I went flying over the dog...I ended up breaking two ribs,” he said.</p>
<p>There are other dangers in rural areas, said Steven Haywood, an emergency room doctor in Corinth, Mississippi.</p>
<p>“Getting struck by vehicles,” he said. “That's definitely the most life-threatening injury when people are walking their dogs.”</p>
<p>Areas like his have many roads without sidewalks or wide shoulders. That is especially dangerous when people wear dark clothes with no reflectors or lights and their animal also does not have such protection.</p>
<p>In addition to lights and reflectors, there are other things that can minimize dog-walking risks.</p>
<p>During snowy or icy weather, wear shoes with good <strong>treads</strong>. Consider wearing shoes with spikes or studs.</p>
<p>Maxson suggests using a non-<strong>retractable</strong> leash of 1.8 to 2.4 meters. “Longer leashes are more likely to get tangled around your legs and cause falls. Retractable leashes can sometimes make your dog more difficult to control.”</p>
<p>They can cause burns when held too close to the body, if they lengthen or retract too quickly.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, dog trainer Shoshi Parks recommends a no-pull harness with a leash clipped to a dog's chest rather than their back. It gives the walker more control and puts less strain on the dog.</p>
<p>Parks suggests holding a leash at your center of gravity, near your torso, hip or thigh. Put your hand through the loop of a leash and hold it a little lower down.</p>
<p>She calls retractable leashes “no go,” meaning you should not use them. They can cause burns when held too close to the body if they lengthen or retract too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to protect yourself </strong></p>
<p>For people with problems balancing or moving around, experts suggest seeking help walking a dog, especially in bad weather. Helpers could include a neighbor, an older child or a professional dog walker.</p>
<p>Haywood and Maxson agreed that balance and strength-training exercises, especially for older adults, can help decrease the risk of falls and broken bones.</p>
<p>And they said working with a dog trainer helps not only the dog but the walker, who can learn to read their dog's body language better.</p>
<p>“Even young, healthy, strong people may have difficulty controlling larger breeds that aren't used to walking on a leash. Any exercise to give strength, give balance, is going to help,” Haywood said. “Make sure you can control the dog that you're walking.”</p>

<p>Cholera is spreading in Sudan as fighting between the military and a <strong>paramilitary </strong>group goes on past 17 months.</p>
<p>Health officials said the disease has killed at least 388 people and sickened 13,000 in the past two months.</p>
<p>The disease is spreading in areas flooded by recent heavy rainfall. The floods have especially affected eastern Sudan where millions of people displaced by war are seeking shelter.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE -People line up in front of a bakery during a cease-fire in Khartoum, Sudan, May 27, 2023. (AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c7c015ef-1dea-412e-b5c2-80483115db30_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE -People line up in front of a bakery during a cease-fire in Khartoum, Sudan, May 27, 2023. (AP Photo/Marwan Ali, File)</span></div>
<p>On Sunday, the Health Ministry said six people had died and about 400 sickened over the weekend. The ministry said the disease has spread to 10 of the country's 18 provinces with the eastern Kassala and al-Qadarif provinces most affected.</p>
<p>Cholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration. The World Health Organization says it can lead to death within hours if not treated. The bacteria spread mainly through <strong>contaminated</strong> water and food.</p>
<p>In 2017, a major outbreak of the disease in Sudan killed 700 people and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months.</p>
<p>Increasing tension between the Sudanese army and the powerful paramilitary group, Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warring in April last year.</p>
<p>The fighting wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas. It has been marked by <strong>atrocities</strong> including mass rape and ethnic killings that could be considered war crimes and crimes against humanity. The United Nations and international rights groups say this is especially the case in the western area of Darfur, which has a history of violence.</p>
<p>The U.N. said at least 20,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been injured. However, rights groups and activists say the numbers are much higher.</p>
<p>The war also created what might be the world's largest displacement crisis at this time. The International Organization for Migration said more than 13 million people have fled their homes since the fighting began. That number includes over 2.3 million who fled to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Seasonal floods and cholera have combined to create a major disaster in Sudan. Recent flooding killed at least 225 people and injured about 900 others, the Health Ministry said. The floods destroyed roads, bridges, and other public systems, and destroyed or damaged more than 76,000 houses, the ministry reported.</p>
<p>A group of international experts called the Famine Review Committee said famine had been confirmed in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people. The camp is about 15 kilometers from North Darfur's capital of al-Fasher. The group said about 25.6 million people — more than half of Sudan's population — could face severe hunger this year.</p>
<p>Fighting is continuing in al-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur that the military still controls. The RSF has been trying to retake it since January.</p>
<p>Last week, the paramilitary force and its allied militias launched a new attack on the city. The military said its forces, aided by rebel groups pushed back the attack and killed hundreds of RSF fighters, including two top commanders.</p>

<p>The American space agency NASA has cleared a spacecraft to launch next month to look for possible signs of life on Jupiter's moon Europa.</p>
<p>Agency officials announced plans for the Europa Clipper spacecraft at a press briefing last week. The launch window for the mission will open October 10. The spacecraft is to launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It will be carried to space aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket built by SpaceX.</p>
<p>The main goal of the mission is for the spacecraft to collect data on whether Jupiter's icy moon could possibly support life. Scientists have identified Europa as a good candidate for holding the right conditions to support life. Several studies have suggested it likely contains a very large ocean beneath its icy surface.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This view of Jupiter's icy moon Europa was captured by the JunoCam imager aboard NASA's Juno spacecraft." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-1529-08db24bc639b_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This view of Jupiter's icy moon Europa was captured by the JunoCam imager aboard NASA's Juno spacecraft.</span></div>
<p>In an online description, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/">says</a> liquid water is necessary for planets or moons to support the “complex chemistry” processes that can make life possible. A huge, salty ocean likely lies beneath Europa's surface and could hold “more water than Earth's oceans combined,” the space agency added.</p>
<p>Scientists have also discovered evidence of chemical compounds and energy forces – including very strong gravity – that could provide the right conditions to support life.</p>
<p>Europa is a little smaller than Earth's moon but is still one of the largest moons in our solar system. It is one of many moons orbiting Jupiter. Astronomers announced in 2023 they had discovered 12 additional moons orbiting Jupiter. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/moons/">says</a> the planet now has a total of 95 confirmed moons.</p>
<p>It is estimated to take six years for the robotic, solar-powered spacecraft to reach Europa. The orbiter is the largest spacecraft built by NASA to investigate another planet. It reaches about 30 meters when fully open. The orbiter is expected to perform many flybys of Europa. Some may get as close as 25 kilometers away from the moon.</p>
<p>After launching, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/meet-europa-clipper/">says</a> Europa Clipper will fly past Mars, then back toward Earth, “using the gravity of each planet to increase its <strong>momentum</strong>.” These kinds of “gravity assists” are expected to provide the needed push to get the spacecraft to Jupiter by 2030.</p>
<p>After reaching Jupiter, Europa Clipper will then spend about one year preparing for the flybys of Europa.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/">says</a> the spacecraft is equipped with nine different scientific instruments. They are designed to collect data from all areas of the moon. None of the instruments themselves were built with the ability to confirm the existence of life forms. But they are designed to investigate Europa's icy surface and the composition of the moon's underground ocean for signs of possible life.</p>
<p>Team leaders say Europa Clipper will also use several cameras – including two using infrared technology – to map the moon in greater detail than in the past. Radar technology will also be used to collect data on the moon's interior and to measure gravity. Together, the instruments and cameras will seek information about Europa's current and past chemistry and <strong>geology</strong>.</p>
<p>Gina DiBraccio is the acting director of NASA's planetary science division in Washington. She told the press briefing the agency is pleased to finally be moving the mission forward after years of planning and preparation. “As an ocean world, Europa is very <strong>intriguing</strong>. And this mission is going to help us to understand a complex piece of our solar system.”</p>
<p>Jordan Evans is Europa Clipper's project manager. He said the last part of the preparation process involved testing of electronic <strong>transistors</strong> widely used on the spacecraft. His team wanted to make sure the transistors could survive the large amounts of radiation Europa Clipper is expected to be hit with in space.</p>
<p>After the tests, Evans said mission leaders were persuaded that the transistors could recover from the effects of heavy radiation during breaks from flybys of the moon. He said this meant all elements of the mission should be able to be carried out as planned.</p>
<p>Evans added, “We are ready for Jupiter.”</p>

            <title>Artists Keep Ancient Japanese Craft Alive (2024/9/23)</title>

<p>Eiko Araki is an expert of the Sanuki Kagari Temari, a Japanese traditional craft. The craft has been passed down for more than 1,000 years on the island of Shikoku.</p>
<p>Araki is at the center of a small circle of women who are working hard to make “temari.” These balls are small artistic objects that have colorful designs. They can take weeks or months to finish. Some cost hundreds of dollars although others are less costly.</p>
<p>The balls are not for sports. They are created as special objects, carrying prayers for health and goodness. They might be treasured like a painting in a Western home.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The temari balls are displayed at Sanuki Kagari Temari in Kawaramachi, Kagawa prefecture, Japan, on Sept. 5, 2024.

(AP Photo/Ayaka McGill)</span></div>
<p>“Out of nothing, something this beautiful is born, bringing joy,” said Araki about the temari. “I want it to be remembered there are beautiful things in this world that can only be made by hand.”</p>
<p><strong>Creating the balls </strong></p>
<p>The area where temari began was good for growing cotton. The round creations continue to be made out of that material.</p>
<p>At Araki's <strong>studio</strong>, which also serves as head office for temari's <strong>preservation </strong>society, there are 140 colors of cotton <strong>thread</strong>.</p>
<p>The women <strong>dye</strong> them by hand, using plants, flowers and other natural ingredients. Outside the studio, cotton thread, in different colors, hangs outside in the shade to dry.</p>
<p>The lengthy process starts with making the basic ball. The careful work with thread called stitching is done on the ball. The outer covering of rice grains, called husks, are cooked and then dried and placed in a piece of cotton. Then the materials are wound with thread, over and over, until, almost magically, a ball appears.</p>
<p>Then the stitching begins.</p>
<p>The balls are surprisingly hard, so each stitch requires a careful, almost painful, push.</p>
<p><strong>New generation </strong></p>
<p>These days, temari is getting new recognition among Japanese and foreigners as well. Caroline Kennedy, for example, took lessons in the ball-making when she was United States ambassador to Japan 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Yoshie Nakamura promotes Japanese handcrafted art in her shop at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Nakamura says she features temari there because of its complex designs.</p>
<p>“Temari that might have been everyday in a faraway <strong>era </strong>is now being used for <strong>interior decoration</strong>,” she said.</p>
<p>“I really feel each Sanuki Kagari Temari speaks of a special, one-and-only existence in the world.”</p>
<p>Araki has come up with some newer designs that feel both modern and historical. She is trying to make the balls more available for everyday life. For example, some of the balls can be used to beautify Christmas trees.</p>
<p>Araki often travels to Tokyo to teach. But mostly she works and gives lessons in her studio.</p>
<p>She started out as a metalwork artist. Her husband's parents were temari masters who worked hard to bring back the artform when it was at risk of dying out.</p>
<p>They were not emotional people. They rarely gave praise and instead always <strong>scolded</strong> her, she remembers. It is a “tough love” teaching method that is common in many Japanese traditional arts, from Kabuki acting to hogaku music. These art forms demand a lifetime of selfless <strong>devotion</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, only a small number of people, all women, can make the temari balls to traditional <strong>standards</strong>.</p>
<p>Araki said that the most difficult issue is training the next generation. She added that it usually “takes over 10 years to train them, so you need people who are willing to continue the craft for a very long time."</p>
<p>But, she explained, “When people start to feel joy along with the hardship that comes with making temari, they<strong> tend</strong> to keep going.”</p>

            <title>Nigeria Aims to Fight Malnutrition with Fortified Bouillon Cubes (2024/9/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/nigeria-aims-to-fight-malnutrition-with-fortified-bouillon-cubes.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/><span class="datetime">22 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>In her small <strong>kitchen</strong>, Idowu Bello looks over a gas cooker while stirring a pot of eba, the thick West African food made from cassava root. Kidney problems and <strong>chronic exhaustion</strong> forced the 56-year-old Nigerian woman to retire from teaching.</p>
<p>Lack of money limits the food Bello has. But doctors have told her to eat a nutrient-rich diet to improve her health and to help her teenage daughter, Fatima, grow.</p>
<p>“Fish, meat, eggs, fruits, vegetables and even milk are costly these days,” Bello said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A worker checks bouillon cubes ahead of packaging at the Sweet Nutrition factory in Ota, Nigeria, Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/78038914-edda-431b-bde9-ee2c66419659_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A worker checks bouillon cubes ahead of packaging at the Sweet Nutrition factory in Ota, Nigeria, Thursday, Sept. 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)</span></div>
<p>But if public health experts and the Nigerian government have their way, Bello and others will soon have a simple <strong>ingredient</strong> they can use to improve their nutrition.</p>
<p>Government officials recently announced rules for adding iron, zinc, folic acid and vitamin B12 to bouillon cubes. The cubes are made from dried meat and vegetables and spices. People usually use them to add taste to soups and stews.</p>
<p>Manufacturers do not yet have to add the four vitamins and minerals to their cubes. But if they choose to add them, the new rules state how they must include them.</p>
<p>The use of <strong>fortified</strong> cubes could help speed up efforts to improve diets lacking necessary micronutrients such as zinc and iron. Public health officials call the lack of such micronutrients “hidden hunger”.</p>
<p>A new report from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation states that fortified cubes could help prevent up to 16.6 million cases of <strong>anemia</strong> and up to 11,000 deaths from <strong>neural tube</strong> defects in Nigeria. Many Nigerian children are also growing less during childhood because of lack of nutrition.</p>
<p>“Everyone uses seasoning cubes,” Bello said as she dropped one in her soup.</p>
<p>A recent Nigerian government study estimated that 79 percent of Nigerian households are food insecure. Extreme heat and changes in rainfall have hurt farming in Nigeria and other countries near the southern part of the Saharan desert.</p>
<p>Helen Keller International (HKI) is a New York-based nonprofit that works to solve problems caused by blindness and malnutrition. It has partnered with the Gates Foundation, businesses and government agencies in Africa to support food fortification.</p>
<p>Augustine Okoruwa is a nutrition expert at HKI. He said the destruction of farmland has caused food prices to increase. That has made it more difficult for people to get animal-based protein into their diet.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, recent economic policies such as the cancellation of gasoline <strong>subsidies</strong> are driving the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in many years. It has become even more difficult for low-earning Nigerians to pay for the food they need.</p>
<p>Around the world, nearly 3 billion people are unable to get enough healthy food. More than 70 percent of them live in developing countries, the World Health Organization says.</p>
<p>The Gates Foundation said that greatly increasing fortified foods would offer a new way to increase micronutrients in foods that people commonly eat in low-income countries.</p>
<p>A study by HKI notes that bouillon cubes are used in nearly every household in countries like Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon. That makes the cubes the “most cost-effective way” to add minerals and vitamins to the diets of millions of people, Okoruwa said.</p>
<p>No Nigerian manufacturers already include the four micronutrients at the amounts stated by the new rules. However, the food industry is showing interest.</p>
<p>Sweet Nutrition, based in Ota, started adding iron to some of its products in 2017. Marketing manager Roop Kumar told The Associated Press that the move was meant to support public health.</p>
<p>Kumar added that the company is testing plans for more fortification with the launch of the new rules.</p>
<p>Okoruwa of HKI said one problem with marketing fortified foods is that many people have received false information about them.</p>
<p>Yunusa Mohammed is the head of the food group at the Standards Organization of Nigeria, the government agency that sets rules for many products people buy. He said educating people about the benefits of fortified products may help push back against the misinformation. He added that there is a need to keep the cost of fortified foods low.</p>
<p>Food fortification is not new in Nigeria. Most of the salt in the country contains iodine. And products such as wheat flour, cooking oil and sugar are fortified with vitamin A by law. But the rule for adding the four vitamins and minerals to bouillon marks the biggest step in fortification.</p>
<p>Company officials, government agencies, research groups and development organizations are working together to support putting the micronutrients in cubes.</p>

            <title>How to Use "Swimming" to Deal with Life's Situations (2024/9/22)</title>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Swimming is a great exercise for staying healthy. But it can also be a life saving skill and help to keep you from <strong>drowning</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in some bodies of water, swimming might be difficult. For example, in very deep, <strong>choppy</strong> or fast moving water swimming can be hard and even dangerous.</p><div class="contentImage"><img a="" alt="A group consisting mostly of women, who call themselves " canada="" chilly="" during="" endorphins="" for="" freezing="" gather="" in="" jan.="" lake="" of="" ontario="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-8f88-08dc17897569_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" sunrise="" swim="" temperatures="" the="" toronto="" waters=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A group consisting mostly of women, who call themselves "The Endorphins", gather for a sunrise swim in the chilly waters of Lake Ontario during freezing temperatures in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Jan. 17, 2024. </span></div>
<p>Choppy water has many small, fast, close waves usually created by wind.</p>
<p>Water currents and <strong>tides </strong>can be very strong. It is easier to swim with them and not so easy to swim against them.</p>
<p>On today's show, we talk about several English expressions that use “swim” to describe different ways to face a situation -- especially danger, difficulty, or any hardship.</p>
<p>Let's start with swimming in rivers. Let's say you jump in a river and swim downstream. That means you are swimming with the current of the water. This makes swimming easier and faster.</p>
<p>So, the expression <u>to swim downstream</u> means using the easy way to get something done.</p>
<p>However, when you swim upstream, you have to fight the flow of the water. In some rivers or other bodies of water, swimming upstream is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>As an expression, <u>swimming upstream</u> means you take a more difficult path to do something. You make it harder for yourself.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p><em>Dealing with money is not my <strong>strong suit</strong>. In fact, last year I was drowning in<strong> </strong>debt. Every month when bills arrived, I felt like I was swimming upstream. So I went to a financial advisor. Now I'm free of debt and staying on a budget. </em></p>
<p>Now, if you are swimming in the ocean, sea, or other large body of water, you may be fighting the tide. <u>Swimming against the tide</u> is another expression. It means you are fighting against very powerful forces. And odds are you will not come out the winner.</p>
<p><u>Swimming with the tide or current</u>, is much easier. Again, this means you have taken an easier path. You have chosen an easier way to do something.</p>
<p>All of these expressions can be used another way. They can also mean that you are going with or against popular opinions or viewpoints.</p>
<p>If you are swimming with the tide or current or swimming downstream, you act the same way as the majority of others. You are <u>going with the flow</u>. That is another common expression – <u>to go with the flow</u>. People who <u>go with the flow</u> are easy-going. They take the popular path without protest.</p>
<p>However, swimming upstream and swimming against the tide or current mean the <strong>opposite</strong>. You are rejecting a popular idea, behavior, or opinion. You are acting against the way the majority of people are acting.</p>
<p>Swimming against the tide is harder. In a sense, you are an <strong>outsider</strong> or <strong>outcast</strong>. You do not have the support of the current or of other people.</p>
<p>Here is an example. If all of your friends are getting married and moving to quiet areas, you may feel the urge to swim with the tide and do the same. Or you could swim against the tide and stay in your small apartment in the center of a busy city with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this<em> Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Britain’s Last Coal-Fired Power Station Set to Close (2024/9/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/britain-s-last-coal-fired-power-station-set-to-close.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">21 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Britain's last coal-fired power station is set to close at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station sits in central Britain's East Midlands area. It has been producing electricity for nearly 60 years.</p>
<p>The planned closure will end pollution-linked coal burning for electricity production in Britain. It also marks the first time a member of the Group of Seven (G7) leading world economies has completely ended coal-fired energy production.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station, which is due to close at the end of the month, is pictured near Nottingham, central England on Sept. 12, 2024. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7cd2219f-eaff-485b-84c4-3d1ff65723aa_cx4_cy18_cw85_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired power station, which is due to close at the end of the month, is pictured near Nottingham, central England on Sept. 12, 2024. </span></div>
<p>The power center operates in the town of Ratcliffe-on-Soar. It has long been one of the area's biggest <strong>landmarks</strong>.</p>
<p>David Reynolds is a 74-year-old retiree. He remembers seeing the station being built as a child before it opened in 1967. He told the French news agency, AFP, "It'll seem very strange because it has always been there." He added, "When I was younger you could go down certain parts and you saw nothing but coal <strong>pits</strong>."</p>
<p>Coal-fueled power production has been an important part of Britain's economic history. It helped drive an Industrial Revolution in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. This helped make the country a world superpower. But the coal-fired centers also led to increased pollution problems across the nation.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, coal burning represented 70 percent of the country's electricity production mix. That level began to decrease in the 1990s. By 2013, coal burning made up 38 percent of the country's electricity production. The rate fell to five percent in 2018 and dropped to one percent in 2023.</p>
<p>Britain's Conservative-led government announced in 2015 it planned to close all coal-fired power stations by 2025 in an effort to reduce carbon <strong>emissions.</strong> Many scientists have linked carbon emissions to planet warming and other climate changes linked to human-related causes.</p>
<p>As of last year, natural gas represented one-third of Britain's electricity production, power operator National Grid ESO reported. The organization also found that a quarter of electricity production came from wind power, while 13 percent was nuclear.</p>
<p>Jess Ralston heads a British policy center called the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. He told AFP that the country's strong push to end coal-fired plants was linked to government requirements as well as a changing economic environment.</p>
<p>"So larger power plants like coal plants had <strong>regulations</strong> put on them...and that meant that it was no longer economically <strong>attractive</strong> to invest in those sorts of plants."</p>
<p>Britain's new Labour government launched its latest energy plan after its election win in July. The plan calls for investing in offshore wind, <strong>tidal</strong> energy and nuclear power. The government has said the aim is to make Britain a world leader in "clean energy."</p>
<p>The planned closure of Ratcliffe-on-Soar on September 30 is seen as an important step in Britain's efforts to decarbonize its electricity system by 2030. The country also plans to become carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>The move makes Britain the first in the G7 to halt all coal powered electricity production. Italy plans to do so by next year, France in 2027, Canada in 2030 and Germany in 2038. Japan and the United States have set no dates for stopping production.</p>

<p>Celebrations across the United States are taking place to mark National Hispanic Heritage Month. </p>
<p>It is a yearly tradition that honors the <strong>diversity</strong> and culture of Hispanic people. The month-long period is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about what Hispanics have given to American culture. It is celebrated each year from September 15 to October 15.</p>
<p>The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America. The latest <strong>census </strong>estimates there are more than 65 million people identified as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Members of the Cathedral City High School Ballet Folklorico pose for photo prior to joining in the Kingdom Day Parade in Los Angeles, Jan. 16, 2023." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b5cb4006-0bf6-4b37-bad9-e82d382a887f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Members of the Cathedral City High School Ballet Folklorico pose for photo prior to joining in the Kingdom Day Parade in Los Angeles, Jan. 16, 2023.</span></div>
<p><strong>A long history</strong></p>
<p>Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law in 1968. The U.S. Library of Congress says every president since Johnson has issued a proclamation for National Hispanic Heritage Month. On September 13, President Joe Biden issued a proclamation recognizing September 15 through October 15, as National Hispanic Heritage Month.</p>
<p>Rachel Gonzalez-Martin is an associate professor of Mexican American and Latino Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. She said the celebration has grown over the past 10 years because of the larger number of Latinos in the U.S. She noted that Hispanic Heritage Month was an official recognition of belonging “that became really powerful."</p>
<p><strong>Many holidays honored</strong></p>
<p>September 15 is the date when some Latin American countries mark their independence days. The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on September 15. Mexico marks its national day on September 16.</p>
<p>Also, during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on September 18.</p>
<p>Alberto Lammers is director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute. He said, "It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S."</p>
<p>Lammers said the four-week period is about honoring the way Hispanic populations have shaped the U.S. in the past and present.</p>
<p>"It gives us a chance to acknowledge how Latinos have been part of this nation for so many centuries," Lammers said. "I think that's what is great about this. It has allowed us to really dig deeper and a chance to tell our stories."</p>
<p><strong>More than one label</strong></p>
<p>Hispanic is a pre-existing term the federal government began using in the 1970s for people whose ancestors came from Spanish-speaking cultures. But some people do not like the term “Hispanic.” They use other terms like "Latino" or "Latinx" which mean different things to different groups.</p>
<p>Events marking National Hispanic Heritage Month are planned in places from California to New York.</p>

            <title>Avant-garde and Vanguard (2024/9/21)</title>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Mohammadreza about the usage of the words “avant-garde” and “vanguard.”</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Avant-garde and Vanguard on Ask a Teacher" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b810a8bf-bfcf-4e8b-bf3f-79f7769990b7_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Avant-garde and Vanguard on Ask a Teacher</span></div>
<p>Could you please explain (the) meaning of avant-garde and vanguard? And what's the difference?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Mohammadreza. I'm happy to answer this question.</p>
<p>We use both of these words to help us describe new ways of doing things or the people involved in those new methods.</p>
<p>However, we can use “vanguard” for more situations than “avant-garde.” “Avant-garde” mostly describes the newest <strong>styles</strong> in the arts — such as writing, music, painting and filmmaking. It can also describe the people who make those new styles. Consider these examples:</p>
<p><em>To some listeners, the music of avant-garde composers may sound strange.</em></p>
<p><em>Her paintings fit within the avant-garde style of the 1960s. </em></p>
<p>We usually use the definite <strong>article</strong> “the” before “avant-garde” to describe the people involved in the new style, as in the following example:</p>
<p><em>This style of filmmaking became popular among the avant-garde. </em></p>
<p>Note that we can use “avant-garde” as either a noun or an adjective. However, “vanguard” is almost always a noun.</p>
<p>“The vanguard” often refers to the people leading new developments. When we use the term “the vanguard,” we usually use the <strong>prepositions</strong> “at,” “in,” or “among” before it, as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>The research team works at the vanguard of computer science.</em></p>
<p><em>The university students were in the vanguard of political change</em>.</p>
<p><em>She is among the vanguard of doctors supporting the new treatment.</em></p>
<p>“Vanguard” also means the advance guard of an army that goes ahead of the main group.</p>
<p>Both “avant-garde” and “vanguard” come from the French language. In fact, English has hundreds of words that come from French. Some examples include <em>coup-d'état</em>, <em>chef</em>, <em>chic</em>, and <em>chauffeur</em>.</p>
<p>For our readers and listeners, do you have a question about American English? Perhaps you would like to know how American English has changed over the years. Or maybe you just need to know how to use particular words. Whatever your question may be, send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="21voa.com">21voa.com</a>.</p>

<p>The United States Congress has honored four women known as the “hidden <strong>figures</strong>” of the space race with its highest civilian award.</p>
<p>The Congressional Gold Medal was presented Wednesday to the families of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson and Christine Darden at the U.S. Capitol. Only Darden is still living. The 82-year-old watched the ceremony from her Connecticut home.</p>
<p>Lawmakers recognized the four Black mathematicians for their critical work early in the space program.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="House Speaker Mike Johnson, center, presents a Congressional Gold Medal posthumously to Joylette Hylick, left, and Katherine Moore, daughters of Katherine Johnson at the Capitol in Washington, Sept. 18, 2024." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/774810ae-f1c8-44dc-91ea-94b7d4c77221_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>They also presented a medal to all the women who worked as mathematicians, engineers and "human computers" in the American space program from the 1930s to 1970s.</p>
<p>Margot Lee Shetterly wrote the 2016 book <em>Hidden Figures</em> about the Black women mathematicians who supported the space program in the 1960s. It was made into a movie of the same name in 2017.</p>
<p>"By honoring them, we honor the very best of our country's spirit," Shetterly said at the ceremony.</p>
<p>The early space program employed hundreds of women to work as mathematicians at what is now NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. But, the Black mathematicians were not permitted to work with the white mathematicians because of racial separation policies at the time. The Black researchers' work went unrecognized for years.</p>
<p>The team used pencils, slide rulers and mechanical calculating machines to calculate the paths of rockets and orbiters in the atmosphere and in space. The path is called the trajectory.</p>
<p>“Our office computed all the trajectories,” Katherine Johnson told <em>The Virginian-Pilot</em> newspaper in 2012. “You tell me when and where you want it to come down, and I will tell you where and when and how to launch it,” she explained.</p>
<p>In 1961, Johnson did trajectory research<strong> </strong>for the Freedom 7 Mission, the first to carry an American into space. The next year, she checked the <strong>calculations</strong> made by a new NASA computer for astronaut John Glenn's planned orbits around the planet.</p>
<p>John Glenn did not trust the new computer. Days before the launch, he told NASA, “Get the girl to check the numbers.” John Glenn become the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962.</p>
<p>Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom – the nation's highest civilian honor<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">–</span> in 2015<span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Her work at NASA helped open doors for many other women to take part in the space program.</span></p>
<p>Dorothy Vaughan rose to become NASA's first Black female supervisor. Mary Jackson was NASA's first Black female engineer. And Christine Darden is best known for her <strong>sonic boom</strong> research.</p>

            <title>Using Discourse Markers in American English (2024/9/20)</title>

<p>
Imagine you are watching an old American movie -- the crime film “Dirty Harry.”</p>
<p>You have heard that one part of the film is very famous in American culture.</p>
<p>You watch the <strong>scene</strong>, which sounds like this:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Using Discourse Markers in American English " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/db01b03d-07d5-4c83-8ecf-e98da144d4f7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Using Discourse Markers in American English </span></div>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">

</span>
<p><em>You go to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky?</em></p>
<p><em>Well, do you, punk?</em></p>
<p>A sudden, strange thought comes to your mind. What is the purpose of the word <em>well?</em></p>
<p>You have heard different English speakers use the word in different ways, but you are not sure what it means.</p>
<p>In our Everyday Grammar report, we will explore the common <strong>adverb</strong> <em>well</em>. We will show you how Americans use it while they are speaking.</p>
<p>Do not fear. Unlike an unexpected meeting with Dirty Harry, this report will be painless!</p>
<p><strong>What are adverbs?</strong></p>
<p>Adverbs are one of the most difficult subjects in English grammar. They are difficult because they represent a large group of words that have different uses.</p>
<p>In general, the definition of an adverb is this: a word that describes a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or a sentence.</p>
<p>Adverbs are often used to show time, place or a way of doing things. They can also show a <strong>degree</strong> or measurement of something.</p>
<p>Consider the sentence, "I really like English grammar." The adverb <em>really </em>changes the meaning of the verb <em>like</em>. The adverb <em>really</em> increases the force of the statement.</p>
<p>There are also sentence adverbs. They limit or describe the meaning of an entire statement.</p>
<p>Sentence adverbs also provide more information about the sentence. These are sometimes called <strong>conjunctive adverbs</strong> or discourse markers. <strong>Regardless</strong> of the name you choose to call them, the purpose is the same: They connect sentences in the same way <strong>coordinating conjunctions</strong> do, but they provide a different kind of information.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>Let's consider the statement:</p>
<p><em>I love English; <u>however,</u> I do not love English grammar!</em></p>
<p>The word <em>however </em>is a conjunctive adverb that shows a <strong>contrast</strong> or comparison is coming.</p>
<p>You can read more about words like these in an earlier Everyday Grammar story called "Contrast and Concession."</p>
<p><strong>The case of "well"</strong></p>
<p>Today we are considering common conjunctive adverbs, or discourse markers, and how they are used in everyday-speech.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the word <em>well</em>. As you heard at the beginning of today's program, <em>well</em> can have a few different uses.</p>
<p><strong>1. Well indicates contrast or disagreement</strong></p>
<p>The first use is to show a contrast or even a disagreement. Consider this line from the ending of the American film “Some Like It Hot.”</p>
<p><em>"You don't understand, Osgood! I'm a man."</em></p>
<p><em>"<u>Well,</u> nobody's perfect..."</em></p>
<p>Here, the speaker uses <em>well </em>to show that a contrast is coming.</p>
<p>The first speaker, the actor Jack Lemmon, expects the second person to become angry when he states he is not a woman, but a man.</p>
<p>But Osgood reacts in an unexpected, or contrasting way. He does not act surprised at all!</p>
<p><strong>2. Wells shows uncertainty </strong></p>
<p>The second use of <em>well </em>is to show <strong>uncertainty</strong>, especially in answers.</p>
<p>Consider this exchange between two friends.</p>
<p><em>Do you mind if I borrow five dollars?</em></p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u></em><em> I'm not sure if I have any money with me...</em></p>
<p>In this example, the second speaker is a little slow in responding. The word <em>well </em>shows that she is not sure if she has the money. Or, maybe she knows she has five dollars, but she does not want to say so.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the point is that <em>well </em>serves as a word that shows movement between the question and the answer. This <strong>transition</strong> shows that there is some uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>3. To show a conversation is ending</strong></p>
<p>The third common use of <em>well </em>is to show a transition to the end of a conversation.</p>
<p>Consider this example. Imagine you are in a business meeting, and your boss makes the following statement:</p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p>In this case, the word <em>well </em>is showing a transition to the end of the meeting. Your boss is showing that he wants the meeting to end soon.</p>
<p>In American culture, this is considered a careful, indirect way to end a conversation.</p>
<p>However, if a speaker directs your attention to the word "well," then the meaning changes. The statement can take on an angry, tense sound.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between these two statements:</p>
<p><em><u>Well,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p><em><u>WELL,</u> this meeting has been very productive.</em></p>
<p>The first statement is a respectful way to end a meeting.</p>
<p>The second statement is a tense, perhaps angry way to bring a meeting to an end. If you heard the second statement in a business meeting, then you should know that something is wrong!</p>
<p><strong>Do you understand the uses of well?</strong></p>
<p>Think back to the movie scene you heard at the beginning of this report. Now that you have learned about the word <em>well, </em>consider what Dirty Harry might have meant.</p>
<p>Like any good crime film, we end with a few questions.</p>
<p>What do you think Dirty Harry meant when he said <em>well?</em> Does he use it in a way that has the same meaning as the uses of <em>well</em> we have discussed, or does he use it in a different way?</p>
<p>Leave your answers in the Comments Section on our website, <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.21voa.com/" target="_blank">www.21voa.com</a>, or on 21VOA.COM.</p>
<p><em>Well,</em> I guess that is all for today's program. Until next time!</p>

            <title>US Police Try AI for Help with Crime Reports (2024/9/19)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By VOA</span><br/><span class="datetime">18 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Some police departments in the United States are experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) tools to help them produce incident reports. Police officers who have tried the AI chatbots praise the technology as a time-saver.</p>
<p>Yet some government lawyers, legal experts, and others have expressed concerns about the AI-produced reports.</p>
<p><strong>A “game changer” </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Captain Jason Bussert demonstrates Draft One, an AI powered software that creates police reports from body cam audio, at Oklahoma City police headquarters on Friday, May 31, 2024 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

(AP Photo/Nick Oxford)</span></div>
<p>One chatbot police are testing uses the same technology as ChatGPT. The company that sells it, Axon, is best known for developing the electroshock weapon called the Taser. It is also the leading supplier of body cameras in the U.S.</p>
<p>Matt Gilmore is a police officer in Oklahoma's capital, Oklahoma City. He describes the AI chatbot as a “game changer” for police work.</p>
<p>Recently, Gilmore and his police dog, Gunner, searched for a group of suspects for almost an hour. In the past, after completing a search, the officer would spend another 30 to 45 minutes writing up a report about the incident. But this time he used AI.</p>
<p>The tool considered all the sounds and radio talk recorded by the microphone attached to Gilmore's body camera. Then it produced a report.</p>
<p>The process took eight seconds.</p>
<p>“It was a better report than I could have ever written, and it was 100 percent accurate. It flowed better,” Gilmore said. The report even documented an event he did not remember: Another officer identifying the color of the car from which the suspects fled.</p>
<p>The new AI product is called Draft One. Axon's founder and CEO Rick Smith said it received the “most positive reaction” of any tool the company has offered.</p>
<p>“They become police officers because they want to do police work, and spending half their day doing data entry is just a <strong>tedious</strong> part of the job that they hate,” Smith said.</p>
<p>But he also noted legal and ethical concerns about the tool.</p>
<p>He said government lawyers prosecuting criminal cases want to be sure that police officers are responsible for writing their reports. Sometimes, officers are called to testify in court about cases they worked on.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutors</strong> “never want to get an officer on the stand who says, well, ‘The AI wrote that, I didn't,'” Smith said.</p>
<p><strong>AI technology concerns</strong></p>
<p>AI technology is not new to police agencies. American police already use such tools to read license plates, identify suspects' faces, recognize the sounds of gunshots, and predict where crimes will happen.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma City, police showed the tool to local prosecutors before using it for criminal cases. The lawyers advised the police to be careful with the tool. For now, it is used only for minor incident reports that do not lead to arrests.</p>
<p>“So no arrests, no <strong>felonies</strong>, no violent crimes,” said Oklahoma City police Captain Jason Bussert, the head of information technology for the 1,170-officer department.</p>
<p>Police in the city of Lafayette, Indiana, have a different policy on the new tool. Police Chief Scott Galloway told the Associated Press that officers can use Draft One for every incident. He said the tool is very popular with the city force. It began using the tool earlier this year.</p>
<p>Police in Fort Collins, Colorado, are also permitted to use the AI tool on any kind of report. However, the head of the force's technology department said the tool does not work well in very noisy parts of the city.</p>
<p>Axon will not say how many police departments are using Draft One. Other companies including Policereports.ai and Truleo offer similar tools. Experts and police officials expect AI-generated reports to become more common in the coming months and years.</p>
<p>Some experts and observers are calling for public discussion about the use of AI tools to write police reports. Chatbots that use AI technology are not mistake-free. Sometimes these chatbots can produce false information.</p>
<p>That issue worries Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at American University.</p>
<p>“I am concerned that <strong>automation</strong> and the ease of the technology would cause police officers to be sort of less careful with their writing,” he said..</p>
<p>Ferguson said a police report is important in determining whether an officer's suspicion supports “someone's loss of liberty.” It is sometimes the only testimony a judge sees in a court case, particularly for minor crimes known as misdemeanors.</p>
<p>Human-created police reports also have problems, Ferguson noted. He said it is not yet known which kind of report writer, human or AI, is more dependable.</p>

<p>When it comes to the business of moving elephants, Dr. Amir Khalil and his team might be the best. The work experience of this Egyptian animal doctor includes possibly the most famous elephant relocation ever.</p>
<p>In 2020, Khalil's team saved Kaavan, an Asian elephant, from years of loneliness at a zoo in Pakistan. They flew him to Cambodia, where he could live a happier life at an elephant <strong>reserve</strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, Kaavan was called the “world's loneliest elephant.” The relocation project was a great success. But Kaavan was not the only elephant that needed help.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Charley, an ageing African elephant, is ready to move from the National Zoological Gardens in Pretoria, South Africa, to his new home.

<p>Next on the list was the last captive elephant in South Africa.</p>
<p>Charley, an aging African elephant, had outlived all the other elephants at a zoo in Pretoria. The zoo was Charley's home for more than 20 years. Wildlife experts say that elephants are <strong>sensitive</strong> animals. And Charley was showing signs of being deeply unhappy since his partner, Landa, died in 2020.</p>
<p>Zoo officials decided he should enjoy his final years in a better place for an old elephant. His new home would be a large private game reserve some 200 kilometers away. There, he would be able to make some new elephant friends.</p>
<p>As an animal rescue specialist at the Four Paws wildlife welfare organization, Khalil was a clear choice for this massive job.</p>
<p><strong>Charley's story</strong></p>
<p>Captured as a young calf in western Zimbabwe in the 1980s, Charley was taken from his <strong>herd</strong>. He spent 16 years in a South African circus. He then spent 23 years as the main <strong>attraction</strong> at Pretoria's National Zoological Garden. Zookeepers estimate Charley is 42 years old. He has spent 40 years in captivity.</p>
<p>“I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of people and children witnessed and enjoyed Charley,” said Khalil. “I think it's time for him to also enjoy life and to live as an elephant.”</p>
<p>Elephants are highly intelligent, highly social animals, Khalil said. While Charley was unhappy, he could also be <strong>naughty</strong> and playful. Khalil compared Charley's last few sad years at the zoo to someone watching the same movie every day, alone.</p>
<p>The technical parts of moving an elephant to a new home are complex. Khalil does not put the elephants to sleep. This is mainly because it is not good for such a big animal. But also, a sleeping elephant is hardly any easier to move.</p>
<p>And so, a process began of <strong>training</strong> an old elephant to step willingly into a large metal transport container. At some point, Khalil and his team would load Charley into this container.</p>
<p>Two other animal doctors, Dr. Marina Ivanova and Dr. Frank G<i></i>246;ritz, worked with Khalil as part of the Kaavan relocation team. They first met Charley two years ago. The meetings were meant to help the doctors decide how ready he was to move. They were also meant to help them earn Charley's trust.</p>
<p>The interactions were carefully controlled. They involved teaching Charley to <strong>respond</strong> to calls to walk up to a “training wall” that has spaces in it for the team to offer him a food reward. In Charley's case, pumpkins, papaya, and beetroot are his favorites.</p>
<p>The same process was finally used to attract Charley into the transport container. It was thought that it might take many months for Charley to learn to step happily into the container. But he was ready to go after less than two weeks of training.</p>
<p>“He was <strong>curious</strong>, and thinking, what is this new toy?” said Ivanova.</p>
<p>In late August, after an hours-long road trip on the back of a truck, Charley moved into his new home at the Shambala private game reserve.</p>
<p>This is a huge change for Charley. So, he will be held in an area separate from the main park for a few weeks to let him get used to his new home, the team said. The park contains wild elephant herds that Charley may join.</p>
<p>Khalil said it is still very rare for captive elephants to be reintroduced to a wild setting. He praised zoo and government officials for permitting this project to go ahead.</p>
<p>“It's a great message from South Africa that even an old elephant <strong>deserves</strong> a new chance,” he said.</p>
<p>At Shambala, Charley will be a wild elephant for the first time in 40 years with thousands of hectares of land to explore. He will have the freedom to take a mud bath. The animal doctors note that elephants are known to have a good memory. So, Charley may remember his life as a calf before he was captured.</p>
<p>Charley is already making contact with the other elephants in the park from his holding pen, Ivanova said. Elephants use deep <strong>rumbles</strong> to communicate. Those deep sounds can be heard five kilometers away.</p>
<p>“I hear him rumbling,” said Ivanova, happily. “We'll help him turn into a wild elephant again.”</p>

            <title>Companies Grow Cocoa Beans in Lab to Produce Chocolate (2024/9/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">17 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Climate change pressures have led some companies to try growing cocoa in new environments to produce chocolate.</p>
<p>Some of the companies have set up growing operations in laboratories to produce cocoa from cell <strong>cultures</strong>. Others are experimenting with non-cocoa substances in an effort to create chocolate <strong>alternatives</strong>.</p>
<p>Higher temperatures worldwide have made it harder to grow cocoa beans in traditional rainforest environments. But worldwide demand remains high for chocolate. So, scientists and businesses are looking to create new products to meet that demand.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Chocolate callets are displayed at the California Cultured office in West Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b024df80-4627-4071-b24c-73c8ec1d04e2_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Chocolate callets are displayed at the California Cultured office in West Sacramento, Calif., Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)</span></div>
<p>California Cultured is a plant cell culture company based in West Sacramento, California. It is growing cocoa from cell cultures inside a lab and plans to start selling its products next year. The process involves putting cocoa bean cells in a container with sugar water. This helps them quickly reproduce and <strong>mature</strong>.</p>
<p>Alan Perlstein, chief executive of California Cultured, spoke to the Associated Press. He said his company's process can produce a harvest in just one week. This compares to six to eight weeks for a traditional harvest. He said the method also uses a lot less water and labor than harvesting cocoa beans in a field.</p>
<p>Perlstein said he sees the demand for chocolate continuing to increase, while the supply decreases. Using alternative processing methods might be the only way to increase the supply of cocoa without causing environmental harm or greatly increasing costs, he said.</p>
<p>Cocoa trees grow about 20 degrees north and south of the equator in areas with warm weather and a lot of rain. But scientists fear further climate change will dry out the land in such areas.</p>
<p>The worldwide market for chocolate is huge. The chocolate market for <strong>candy</strong> worldwide reached $238.5 billion in 2023, research website <em>Statista</em> <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/983554/global-chocolate-confectionery-market-size">reports.</a> Sales in the United States alone reached more than $25 billion in 2023, the National Confectioners Association said. The trade organization represents the candy industry.</p>
<p>The price of cocoa increased earlier this year because of rising demand and West African crop losses from plant disease and weather changes. West Africa produces most of the world's cocoa.</p>
<p>Carla D. Martin is executive director of the U.S.-based Fine Cacao and Chocolate Institute. She told the AP that drops in the world cocoa supply have led some companies to look for ways to replace the <strong>ingredient</strong> that produces the taste of chocolate.</p>
<p>Planet A Foods is once such company in Planegg, Germany. It believes the taste of mass market chocolate is created not only by the bean itself, but also how it is <strong>fermented</strong> and cooked.</p>
<p>The company has tested out many ingredients, from olives to seaweed, to find a possible substitute. It is currently using a mix of oats and sunflower seeds as the best tasting chocolate alternative, said company spokesperson Jessica Karch. Planet A Foods calls the product “ChoViva,” which can be used in place of other ingredients in baked goods.</p>
<p>“The idea is not to replace the high quality, 80 percent dark chocolate, but really to have a lot of different products in the mass market,” Karch told the AP.</p>
<p>Similar efforts can be found in Israel. One company there, Celleste Bio, is taking cocoa bean cells and growing them indoors to produce cocoa powder and cocoa butter.</p>
<p>The company's co-founder, Hanne Volpin, said that within a few years the company aims to be able to produce cocoa no matter what the situation is with climate change and disease. Volpin added, “We only have a small field, but eventually, we will have a farm of bioreactors.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>This autumn, students in the Finnish town of Riihimaki headed back to school with backpacks full of books. This marks a change from recent years.<br/>
今年秋天，芬兰里希马基镇的学生背着装满书籍的背包回到学校。这标志着近年来的一次变化。</p>
<p>For the past 10 years, the Finnish government pushed laptops and other electronic devices in the classroom.<br/>
在过去的10年里，芬兰政府在课堂上推广笔记本电脑和其他电子设备。</p>
<p>Finland's public education system is known for its good results and its readiness to try new teaching methods. Until recently, many schools gave laptops for free to all students from as early as age 11.<br/>
芬兰的公共教育体系以其良好的成绩和乐于尝试新教学方法而闻名。最近，许多学校向最小11岁的所有学生免费提供笔记本电脑。</p>
<p>But Finnish parents and teachers have become increasingly concerned over the effect of screens on children.<br/>
但芬兰的家长和老师越来越担心电子屏幕对孩子的影响。</p>
<p>Riihimaki is a town of about 30,000 people. It sits 70 kilometers north of the capital, Helsinki. In 2018, the town's middle schools stopped using most books. But this school year, schools in Riihimaki are going back to pen and paper.<br/>
里希马基是一个约有3万人的小镇。它位于首都赫尔辛基以北70公里处。2018年，该镇的中学停止使用大部分书籍。但本学年，里希马基镇的学校将回到纸和笔的时代。</p>
<p>"Young people are using phones and digital devices so much these days that we don't want school to be one of the places where children are only staring at screens," said Maija Kaunonen, an English teacher at Pohjolanrinne middle school.<br/>
Pohjolanrinne中学的英语老师麦杰亚·考诺宁说：“现在年轻人使用手机和数字设备的频率太高了，我们不希望学校成为孩子们只盯着屏幕的地方。”</p>
<p>The distractions that come with the use of digital devices make many children restless and unable to give their full attention to learning, Kaunonen said.<br/>
考诺宁说，使用数字设备带来的分心让许多孩子坐立不安，无法全神贯注于学习。</p>
<p>She added, "Most students just did the exercises as quick as they could” so they could then move on to using social media.<br/>
她补充道，“大多数学生只是尽可能快地做练习”，这样他们就可以继续使用社交媒体了。</p>
<p>"And it took them no time at all to change tabs in the browser. So when the teacher came round to them, they could say: 'Yes, I was doing this exercise'."<br/>
“他们在浏览器中切换窗口几乎不需要时间。所以当老师走过来时，他们可以说：‘是的，我正在做这个练习’。”</p>
<p>Across Finland, children's learning results have been slowly getting worse in recent years. In answer, the government plans new laws to ban the use of personal devices, such as phones, during school hours to cut back on screen time.<br/>
近年来，芬兰各地的儿童学习成绩逐渐恶化。作为回应，政府计划制定新的法律，禁止在上课时间使用手机等个人设备，以减少电子屏幕使用时间。</p>
<p>Improved concentration<br/>
提高注意力</p>
<p>One of Kaunonen's students is 14-year-old Elle Sokka. She said she did not always pay attention to the school subjects when learning digitally. Instead, she moved to another web page.<br/>
14岁的艾莉·苏卡是考诺宁的学生之一。她说，在数字化教学时，她并不总是将注意力放在学校科目上。相反，她转到了另一个网页。</p>
<p>Eighth-graders Miko Mantila and Inka Warro, both 14, said their concentration has improved since books returned to the classrooms.<br/>
14岁的八年级学生米克·曼蒂拉和因卡·瓦罗说，自从书本回到教室后，他们的注意力有所提高。</p>
<p>"Reading, for one, is much easier and I can read much faster from books," Mantila said.<br/>
曼蒂拉说：“首先阅读要容易得多，而且我从书本上读得更快。”</p>
<p>"And if you have to do homework late at night, it's easier to go to sleep when you haven't just been looking at a device," Warro added.<br/>
瓦罗补充道：“如果你必须在深夜做作业，那么当你不是一直盯着电子设备的时候就更容易入睡。”</p>
<p>Minna Peltopuro is a psychologist working with the town on the change. She said the total screen time should be cut because Finnish teenagers currently stare at a screen for up to six hours each day on average. She added that too much use of electronic devices comes with both physical and mental risks, such as eye problems and growing anxiety.<br/>
明娜·佩尔托普罗是一名与该镇合作进行改革的心理学家。她说，总屏幕使用时间应该减少，因为芬兰青少年目前平均每天盯着屏幕长达6个小时。她补充说，过度使用电子设备会带来身体和精神上的风险，比如视力问题和日益增长的焦虑。</p>
<p>Peltopuro added that the brain is at risk when trying to do more than one thing at a time. "Especially at a young age, one cannot manage it well," she said.<br/>
佩尔托普罗补充说，当试图同时做多件事时，大脑会面临风险。她说：“尤其是在年轻的时候，人们无法很好地应对它。”</p>

            <title>US Report: Share of Foreign-Born in U.S. Grows to Highest Level in 100 Years (2024/9/18)</title>

<p>Last year, the percentage of U.S. <strong>residents</strong> who were foreign-born grew to its highest level in more than 100 years.</p>
<p>Recently, the U.S. Census Bureau released its yearly American Community Survey that provided detailed numbers.</p>
<p>The American Community Survey follows family life, income, education levels, disabilities, military service, and employment, among other subjects.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A man, part of a group of 50 new United States citizens, takes part in a naturalization ceremony before the San Diego Padres host the Minnesota Twins in a baseball game at Petco Park, Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2024, in San Diego.

<p>The study, or survey, shows the share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023 to 14.3 percent from 13.9 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>International <strong>migrants</strong> have become a main cause of population growth in recent years.</p>
<p>Migrants are increasing their share of the population as Americans are having fewer children compared with years past. The percentage of the foreign-born population in the United States has not been this high since 1910 when it was 14.7 percent. At that time, waves of people came to the U.S. in search of a better life.</p>
<p>Luciana Bracho moved legally to Miami from Venezuela.</p>
<p>“We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have normal services such as water and electricity,” she said.</p>
<p>Bracho's move was part of a special official program known as a <strong>humanitarian parole program</strong>. She came with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. “I like Miami and the <strong>opportunities</strong> that I have had,” she said.</p>
<p>In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of the population growth in the United States. In the 2020s, they have made up almost three-fourths of U.S. growth.</p>
<p>The growth appears to be mainly people coming from Latin America. Their estimated share of the foreign-born population increased to 51.2 percent from 50.3 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>Latin Americans have increased among U.S. residents born in another country. The share of foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia has dropped a little.</p>
<p>Nicole Díaz was an opposition activist in Venezuela. She said she left after her life was threatened. Díaz lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and nine-year-old daughter. Díaz described herself as “100 percent happy” living in South Florida, where the family pays $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p>“After being in different countries, working here is <strong>relaxed</strong>, despite the language,” Díaz said. “But housing is very expensive, and we have been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes for the rent.”</p>
<p>Delaware was among the states with the largest increases in the foreign-born population from 2022 to 2023. The small state went to 11.2 percent from 9.9 percent. Georgia went to 11.6 percent from 10.7 percent. And New Mexico went from 10.2 percent from 9.3 percent.</p>
<p>The share of the foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau numbers do not show whether people are in the United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top political issue in 2024.</p>
<p>The study says the percentage of U.S. residents who say they are Hispanic, no matter what race, increased last year to 19.4 percent from 19.1 percent the year before.</p>
<p>At the same time, those who say they are “non-Hispanic white” dropped from 57.7 percent to 57.1 percent.</p>
<p>The share of U.S. residents who identify as Black dropped a little, from 12.2 percent to 12.1 percent.</p>
<p>And the share of U.S. residents who identify as Asian went from 5.9 percent to 6 percent.</p>
<p>The average age of U.S. residents continues to increase. The median age went from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023.</p>
<p>Americans born after World War II, from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, are known as the “baby boom” generation. They are now senior citizens.</p>
<p>The generation known as “millennials,” those born between the early 1980s and middle 1990s, are entering middle age. While the share of children under age 18 remained the same at 21.7 percent, the share of senior citizens aged 65 and over increased to 17.7 percent from 17.3 percent.</p>
<p>Other numbers show that working from home is decreasing after the COVID-19 pandemic. The share of employees working from home dropped last year to 13.8 percent from 15.2 percent in 2022.</p>
<p>The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus utilities and related costs, grew faster than median home values in 2023 for the first time in 10 years. The 3.8 percent rise in rental costs was the largest yearly increase since at least 2011. However, the share of renter income spent on rent and utility costs remained unchanged at 31 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>That finding suggests that incomes kept up with rent increases, the Census Bureau said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">16 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The four-member crew of a private space flight has returned to Earth after a trip that included the first-ever spacewalks by non-professional astronauts.</p>
<p>American business leader Jared Isaacman organized and paid for the five-day <strong>mission</strong>, called Polaris Dawn. The American company SpaceX was a partner in the operation. It built both the Crew Dragon <strong>capsule</strong> and the Falcon 9 rocket that carried it to space.</p>
<p>The capsule dropped into the Gulf of Mexico near Florida early Sunday as planned.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image made from a SpaceX video shows the start of the first private spacewalk led by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman Thursday Sept. 12, 2024. (SpaceX via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/cde8a4a3-9aac-4069-b0a6-831406bbe973_cx5_cy10_cw74_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image made from a SpaceX video shows the start of the first private spacewalk led by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman Thursday Sept. 12, 2024. (SpaceX via AP)</span></div>
<p>The mission is historic for two reasons. First, Crew Dragon reached a top <strong>altitude</strong> of more than 1,400 kilometers. That was the highest level any crewed mission has reached since the American space agency NASA's Apollo program ended in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Second, two crew members completed spacewalks during the mission. Isaacman was first to pop his head out of the Crew Dragon capsule on September 12. He spent about 10 minutes with the top half of his body outside the capsule as the spacecraft orbited hundreds of kilometers above Earth.</p>
<p>A video camera captured Isaacman saying at the time, "Back at home we all have a lot of work to do. But from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world."</p>
<p>SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis took a turn after Isaacman returned.</p>
<p>During each spacewalk, the astronauts kept their feet positioned inside the spacecraft. They moved their bodies in several exercises to test their spacesuits.</p>
<p>Until Polaris Dawn, only government astronauts and cosmonauts in government service had completed spacewalks.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The other Polaris Dawn crewmembers were SpaceX engineer Anna Menon, and Scott Poteet, a retired American Air Force officer. They did not leave the spacecraft. However, they wore the same kind of spacesuits as Isaacman and Gillis. They needed the protection as the capsule environment was depressurized for the space walks.</p>
<p>Isaacman had said a main goal of the mission would be to test the new spacesuit design in preparation for long-term stays in space. SpaceX has said the suits are equipped with the latest data-gathering instruments, as well as cameras and improved <strong>mobility</strong> systems.</p>
<p>Before the mission launched, SpaceX said the crew planned to carry out a series of experiments aboard the Crew Dragon capsule. Among these were a test of laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's internet satellite system. The laser method – which has also been tested by NASA – is designed to greatly increase space communication speeds.</p>
<p>Many of the experiments dealt with observations of how human health is affected during long space missions. Among these will be tests with special contact lenses containing microelectronics that can continuously identify changes in eye pressure and shape.</p>
<p>Isaacman is the head of payment processing company Shift4Payments. He has an estimated personal worth of $2 billion. Isaacman has not said publicly how much he paid SpaceX for its service.</p>
<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three planned missions under the Polaris program. The second will also use a Dragon capsule, while the third and final is expected to use SpaceX's Starship rocket. SpaceX chief Elon Musk has said his company plans to use Starship to carry future space travelers to the moon and Mars.</p>

            <title>Poisonous Plants Look Like Safe Ones (2024/9/17)</title>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle Report</em>.</p>
<p>Actor Alicia Silverstone worried fans on social media recently. While on a trip to England, she posted a TikTok video of herself tasting a poisonous berry she found along a sidewalk.</p>
<p>Silverstone, who appeared in the 1995 movie <em>Clueless</em>, said she thought the fruit was a tomato. But when she bit into it and found that it had an unusual taste, she realized that it was not the common food.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An employee touches the flower of a Datura Stramonium plant, part of the nightshade family, at The Royal Botanic Gardens in London, Monday, Sept. 22, 2014. The nightshade family is known to have toxins in fruit or in stems and leaves.(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/4bc3b83a-7259-440e-870a-fa7c6e0171be_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An employee touches the flower of a Datura Stramonium plant, part of the nightshade family, at The Royal Botanic Gardens in London, Monday, Sept. 22, 2014. The nightshade family is known to have toxins in fruit or in stems and leaves.(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth, File)</span></div>
<p>Plant expert, Jessica Damiano, recently wrote about poisonous plants that look like common foods for the Associated Press.</p>
<p>She said the fruit that looked like a tomato appears to have been a Jerusalem cherry.</p>
<p>Often sold as a houseplant, all parts of the Jerusalem cherry are poisonous. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says the plant is not only harmful to humans but also to dogs, cats and horses.<strong> </strong>Eating large amounts can be deadly. Silverstone was lucky because she did not swallow the berries.</p>
<p>She is also lucky because the berries were reddish orange. This means they were <strong>ripe</strong>. While all parts of the Jerusalem cherry are poisonous, the plant's unripe berries can be especially dangerous. They can cause problems with the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems. <strong>Symptoms</strong> from eating the fruit include mental <strong>confusion</strong>, stomach pain, high body temperature, <strong>vomiting</strong>, <strong>paralysis</strong> and more.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem cherry is a member of the nightshade family. It is in the same family of plants that includes tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, potatoes and tomatillos. Although the fruits of those crops are safe to eat, their leaves are <strong>toxic</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Other toxic lookalikes</strong></p>
<p>The Jerusalem cherry is not the only toxic plant that looks like a safe one.</p>
<p>The poisonous Carolina horsenettle fruit also looks like a tomato. However, its common name is a <strong>dead giveaway</strong> that it is dangerous. It is called devil's tomato. It is also known as devil's potato to add to the confusion.</p>
<p>Other members of the nightshade family are poisonous in different ways. For example, a plant named deadly nightshade, or belladonna, is so toxic that it was used as a murder weapon in Europe during the Middle Ages, a time more than 500 years ago. Its berries, however, could be mistaken for blueberries.</p>
<p>Pokeweed and Virginia creeper fruits also look like blueberries, and both can be deadly if eaten.</p>
<p>Lilies are toxic, but they look like <strong>edible</strong> wild onion or garlic grasses, especially when they first come out of the ground.</p>
<p>Edible wild onion and garlic grasses have other toxic lookalikes, too -- including a plant sometimes called death camas. These plants grow in lawns and wild areas in the spring, and they are a common cause of livestock poisoning. They are dangerous for humans, too.</p>
<p>Toxic carrot and parsley lookalikes can also make you sick. Wild parsnip has flowers like a carrot and leaves like parsley. Simply touching it can cause a skin problem called photodermatitis. It causes sun sensitivity that can last for a year. Poison hemlock looks similar but is much larger. Eating that plant can lead to breathing problems.</p>
<p>Creeping buttercup looks like flat-leaf parsley. It is an <strong>invasive</strong> plant that can cause severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems.</p>
<p>And the deadly Canadian moonseed can be <strong>confused </strong>with wild grape. However, its taste is so <strong>bitter</strong> that you would likely spit it out before swallowing it. This is a good thing because eating it can lead to death.</p>
<p>If you think you have swallowed a toxic plant by mistake, contact a poison control center in your area or your doctor. There is additional information on the website <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.poison.org">poison.org</a>.</p>
<p>Damiano advises to use common sense with plants you find in the wild. If you are not completely sure that something is food, do not eat it.</p>

            <title>Japan Celebrates Historic Emmy Award Wins for 'Shogun' (2024/9/17)</title>

</span>
<p>Japan is celebrating the record-breaking Emmy Award wins of the American television series <em>Shogun</em>. Many Japanese, however, say they have not watched the series.</p>
<p><em>Shogun </em>is<em> </em>a historical <strong>fiction</strong> that explores the country's warring <strong>dynasties</strong> in the <strong>feudal</strong> period. It crushed all-time records at the television awards ceremony on Sunday in Los Angeles, California. The series won 18 Emmys in all. And it became the first non-English-language winner of the highly sought award for best <strong>drama</strong> series.</p>
<p>Lead actor Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Lord Toranaga, became the first Japanese man to win an Emmy for acting. Anna Sawai became the first woman of Asian ancestry to win an Emmy for acting. She played Lady Mariko.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Some of the cast and crew of 'Shogun,' winner of the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series pose in the press room during the 76th Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, California, on September 15, 2024.

<p>"As a Japanese, I'm happy Sanada won," Kiyoko Kanda, a 70-year-old retiree, told the news group Agence France-Presse in Tokyo. "He worked so hard since he moved to Los Angeles," she said. But she admitted that she has only watched the show's <strong>trailer</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>'Groundbreaking' realism key to ‘Shogun' success</strong></p>
<p><em>Shogun</em> is available only on Disney's streaming platform, which is relatively new in Japan.</p>
<p>"I want to watch it. I'm curious to know how Japan is <strong>portrayed</strong>," Kanda said.</p>
<p>Otsuka, who chose not to give her first name, said she, too, has not watched the show. "But I saw the news and I'm happy he won."</p>
<p>The 63-year-old Sanada began acting at the age of five in Tokyo. He moved to Los Angeles after appearing in <em>Last Samurai</em> in 2003.</p>
<p>Yusuke Takizawa, age 41, also saw only the trailer for <em>Shogun</em>. But he said he could tell the show was a high-quality production.</p>
<p>"I was impressed by the high-spirited acting, the attention to detail and the film technology," Takizawa told AFP outside Osaka Castle, a major historical site where some of the story is set.</p>
<p>"I think many young people will want to try their hand in Hollywood after watching Sanada," he said.</p>
<p><strong>From page to film, again...</strong></p>
<p>Shogun was adapted from a popular 1975 book of the same name by writer James Clavell. The series, filmed in Canada, tells the story of Lord Toranaga, who fights for his life against his enemies alongside Mariko and British sailor John Blackthorne.</p>
<p>A first television production of Shogun came out in 1980 and centered on Blackthorne.</p>
<p>The new <em>Shogun</em> is not. It also breaks away from years of prejudiced representations of Japan in Western entertainment media. Notably, the 2024 production is mostly in Japanese, not English.</p>
<p>Sanada, who also co-produced the series, is credited with bringing a new level of cultural and historical understanding to <em>Shogun</em>.</p>

            <title>The Debate: Will AI Take Away Many Human Jobs? (2024/9/16)</title>

<p>ChatGPT and other <strong>generative AI</strong> tools have raised concerns that<strong> chatbots</strong> will replace many kinds of workers. Writers, <strong>editors</strong>, and <strong>customer </strong>service representatives are among the jobs that could be affected.</p>
<p>But some people are suggesting that AI might not reduce jobs as many people fear. Instead, the technology might turn out to be more like the technological developments of the past, such as the steam engine, electricity or the internet.</p>
<p>Supporters reason that AI might destroy some jobs while creating others. They also say that the technology will probably make workers more productive, <strong>benefiting</strong> themselves, their employers and the economy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Customer Experience Representatives Stanley Solis, center, and other representatives take calls at an Alorica center, Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in San Antonio.

<p><strong>Looking for lessons from history </strong></p>
<p>Nick Bunker is an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, part of a job search website. He said he thinks AI “will affect many, many jobs — maybe every job indirectly” to some degree.</p>
<p>Bunker added that he does not believe the technology is going to lead to a lot of unemployment. “We have seen other big technological events in our history, and those didn't lead to a large rise in unemployment. Technology destroys but also creates. There will be new jobs that come about,” he said.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence gives machines the ability to perform tasks once thought to require human intelligence. The basic technology has existed in early versions for many years.</p>
<p>Some reports say it began with a problem-solving computer program called Logic Theorist. The program was developed in the 1950s at what is now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. More recent examples include voice assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or IBM's chess-playing computer, Deep Blue, which defeated then-world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.</p>
<p><strong>Predictions and current evidence </strong></p>
<p>Sam Altman is the chief of OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Altman said in a discussion at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in May that he believes, “AI is going to eliminate a lot of current jobs, and this is going to change the way that a lot of current jobs function.''</p>
<p>Some people say that AI chatbots are not replacing human workers in a widespread way. Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a company that tracks job cuts, said it has yet to see much evidence of job losses caused by AI.</p>
<p>However, the fear that AI is a threat to some kinds of jobs has a basis in reality.</p>
<p>Suumit Shah is an Indian business owner who announced last year that he had replaced 90 percent of his customer support workers with a chatbot named Lina. Shah's company, Dukaan, helps customers set up e-commerce sites to sell goods online. Shah said the average amount of time it took to answer a customer's question shrank from 1 minute, 44 seconds to “instant.” The chatbot also cut the time needed to resolve problems from more than two hours to just over three minutes.</p>
<p>A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University identified jobs most exposed to AI models. The jobs included telemarketers and teachers of English and foreign languages. But being affected by AI does not necessarily mean losing your job to it. AI can free people to do more creative jobs.</p>
<p>The Swedish company IKEA introduced a customer-service chatbot in 2021 to deal with simple questions. Instead of cutting jobs, IKEA kept 8,500 customer-service workers to advise buyers on interior design and to deal with complex customer calls.</p>
<p>Chatbots can also make workers more efficient. Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University, Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of MIT studied 5,200 customer-support agents at a large company. The agents used a generative AI-based assistant. The AI tool provided valuable suggestions. It also supplied links to useful company documents.</p>
<p>The researchers found that those who used the chatbot were 14 percent more productive than workers who did not use the chatbot. The workers who used AI took more calls and completed them faster. The biggest productivity gains — 34 percent — came from the least-experienced, least-skilled workers.</p>
<p>Alorica is a company in Irvine, California, that runs customer-service centers around the world. The company has introduced an artificial intelligence translation tool that lets its representatives communicate with customers who speak any of 200 different languages and 75 dialects.</p>
<p>The Real-time Voice Language Translation tool also lets customers and Alorica agents speak and hear each other in their own languages.</p>
<p>“It allows (Alorica reps) to handle every call they get,” said Rene Paiz, a vice president of customer service. Paiz added, “I don't have to hire externally' just to find someone who speaks a specific language.</p>
<p>Alorica said it is not cutting jobs. It continues to seek new employees who are comfortable with new technology.</p>
<p>“We are still actively hiring,'' Paiz says. “We have a lot that needs to be done out there.''</p>

<p>The American space agency NASA says it has confirmed the long-suspected existence of an electric field that surrounds Earth.</p>
<p>A rocket named Endurance gathered the information that led to the confirmation. Endurance launched from Norway on May 11, 2022. The launch site was the closest possible to the North Pole.</p>
<p>Endurance reached a top altitude of 768 kilometers. The rocket captured data on the electric field during its 19-minute flight before splashing down in the sea, off the coast of Greenland.</p>

<p>NASA says that since the 1960s, spacecraft flying over Earth's <strong>poles</strong> have recorded collections of particles flowing from the planet's atmosphere into space. But the cause of these outflows long remained a mystery. Scientists lacked the technology and tools to confirm an electric field and further explore it.</p>
<p>But the development in recent years of new observation methods and instruments led NASA to plan the Endurance mission. So the agency built the rocket and a new data instrument and planned the launch.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>NASA scientist Glyn Collinson, an expert in space instrument design, led the Endurance mission.</p>
<p>Collinson <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCM1MaYC5lM&amp;t=29s">explains</a> in a video that scientists believe the electric field they searched for was one of three energy fields affecting Earth. The others are gravitational and magnetic. Scientists are calling the third energy field the “ambipolar electric field.”</p>
<p>A NASA statement <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasa-discovers-long-sought-global-electric-field-on-earth/#h-launching-a-rocket-from-the-arctic">says</a> scientists believe the ambipolar field is an influential driver of the “polar wind.” They described the wind as “a steady outflow of charged particles into space that occurs above Earth's poles.” Scientists believe the ambipolar electric field <strong>counteracts</strong> some of the effects of gravity.</p>
<p>This electric field lifts the charged particles in Earth's upper atmosphere “to greater heights than they would otherwise reach,” NASA said. Scientists had theorized this electric field began at around 250 kilometers high. This is where atoms in our atmosphere break apart into negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. This activity helps form a part of Earth's atmosphere known as the ionosphere.</p>
<p>NASA noted the Endurance mission permitted researchers to successfully identify and measure “a planet-wide electric field thought to be as <strong>fundamental</strong> to Earth as its gravity and magnetic fields.” A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07480-3.epdf?sharing_token=I_iijIlqb3HMon5ISI-xBdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Nyrlc02oJzExWUuDgAFVXFWQm-5tl5ZQFVbDbaRGPu8BS5_R9K9Au1gs-SKWxRrjMbJ2eV5VK-jFk3v5NbIHray3_BN5_uObULF-IXEID0EETe47O4K1uAgQiM7aC8d4E%3D">study</a> describing the team's results recently appeared in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>NASA said studying the ambipolar electric field is important because it “may have shaped our planet's <strong>evolution</strong> in ways yet to be explored.” In addition, the agency said further study of this field can help scientists better understand other planets and possibly find ones with conditions that may support life.</p>
<p>Leader Collinson said that, during the mission, the instrument on the rocket was able to measure an electrical voltage of 0.55 volts. He said this level is very low, about the same voltage used to power a watch <strong>battery</strong>. But, he noted that 0.55 volts was “just the right amount” to explain the outflows of particles driving the polar wind.</p>
<p>Collinson said he finds the results “incredibly important” because the newly confirmed electric field can counter the effects of gravity and “basically lifts the skies up.” He described the field as a kind of “<strong>conveyor belt</strong> that's lifting this atmosphere up into space.”</p>
<p>Alex Glocer is a project scientist for the Endurance mission and was a co-writer of the study. He said he agrees with those findings. “That's more than enough to counter gravity – in fact, it's enough to launch them upwards into space at supersonic speeds,” Glocer said. Supersonic describes speeds that are greater than the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The team said the study results suggest the ambipolar electric field also greatly increases the density of the ionosphere at higher atmospheric positions.</p>
<p>Collinson said, “Any planet with an atmosphere should have an ambipolar field. Now that we've finally measured it, we can begin learning how it's shaped our planet as well as others over time.”</p>

            <title>Brazilian Dog Excels at Footvolley (2024/9/16)</title>

<p>The Brazilian sport of footvolley is a popular activity on sunny days along Rio de Janeiro's coast. But, recently, people stopped to watch one especially exceptional player: a three-year-old named Floki. But the young player is not a child. Floki is a dog.</p>
<p>He is also very good at footvolley.</p>
<p>The rules of footvolley are almost the same as <strong>beach</strong> volleyball. However, the game requires a lower <strong>net</strong> and a soccer ball replaces the volleyball. Similar to soccer, the rules bar players from using their hands on the ball.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The border collie named Floki plays footvolley, a combination of soccer and volleyball, on Leblon beach in Rio de Janeiro, Sunday, Sept. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/88b6f09c-68d1-4e0b-a6e8-1ab7456b930e_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The border collie named Floki plays footvolley, a combination of soccer and volleyball, on Leblon beach in Rio de Janeiro, Sunday, Sept. 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)</span></div>
<p>Not a problem for the four-legged Floki. He jumps up and hits the ball with his mouth.</p>
<p>Floki has become popular on social media in Brazil, with hundreds of thousands of followers on services such as Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p>Floki's owner, Gustavo Rodrigues, is a footvolley trainer, or coach.</p>
<p>Floki entered Rodrigues' life as a <strong>puppy</strong> and demonstrated his sporty qualities early on. At just 2 months old, he started playing with small balloons. He would jump in the air to reach them.</p>
<p>Rodrigues started Floki out on an exercise called “altinha.” It involves a group standing in a circle and passing a soccer ball through the air for as long as possible.</p>
<p>In 2023, Floki started playing the complex, competitive game of footvolley.</p>
<p>Footvolley players need skills such as <strong>agility </strong>and timing. Just two people must cover an entire half court. This requires quick and surefooted moves on soft sand under the hot sun.</p>
<p>Floki was a natural. A star was born.</p>
<p>Rodrigues, age 26, said about Floki, “He does things that even some professionals don't — like positioning on the court."</p>
<p>Rodrigues added that, during play, Floki always “turns toward the ball to always hit it straight on.”</p>
<p>It is clear this high-energy dog lives for this game. Even when resting on the beach, Floki was paying careful attention to a nearby footvolley competition.</p>
<p>When playing, he makes dog sounds to communicate with Rodrigues. Floki barks to let his human teammate know he is open for a pass. The dog appears to understand the basic rules of the game.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he surprises the other team with an unexpected drive of the ball over the net. He scores a point and then he jumps into Rodrigues' arms to celebrate.</p>
<p>One of the watchers on a recent Sunday was Luiza Chioli, who had traveled to Rio from Sao Paulo. She already knew the famous Floki from TikTok. She said she was surprised that the real dog was as good at footvolley as the videos had suggested.</p>
<p>“Seeing social media, we had thought it was just cuts, that they used the best takes,” said Chioli, 21. “But we saw he played, performed the whole time, did really well. It's really cool.”</p>
<p>Proposals for partnerships and business deals with Rodrigues and Floki followed the dog's growing stardom. The two live in the capital Brasilia. However, they often travel to Rio and other Brazilian states for games, marketing appearances and social media work.</p>

            <title>In Greece, Village Appears when Lake Dries Up (2024/9/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A sunken Greek village has begun to reappear after water levels dropped in the lake that covered it. Extreme hot, dry weather is blamed for the disappearing Lake Mornos.</p>
<p>The village of Kallio was flooded in 1980 to create the lake. The plan aimed to help supply the ever-increasing water demands of the national capital about 200 kilometers away. Now, long stretches of dried soil mixed with old bricks surround the ruins of the Kallio.</p>
<p>"Day by day, the water goes down," said Dimitris Giannopoulos, mayor of central Greece's Dorida area. Reuters news agency reports Lake Mornos supplies water to nearly half of Greece's population.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The images shows the reappearing remains of buildings of the village of Kallio, which was intentionally flooded in 1980 to create a reservoir to supply water needs of Greek's capital Athens on September 3, 2024.(REUTERS/Stelios Misinas)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6d294fa1-1e3b-417d-b340-016ae150b792_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The images shows the reappearing remains of buildings of the village of Kallio, which was intentionally flooded in 1980 to create a reservoir to supply water needs of Greek's capital Athens on September 3, 2024.(REUTERS/Stelios Misinas)</span></div>
<p>Last winter brought little snow to Greece. This summer brought heatwaves but little rain to the country. Last winter was Greece's warmest on record.</p>
<p>Greece's dry climate makes it especially <strong>susceptible</strong> to the effects of a warming planet. The conditions worsened summer wildfires including some that reached outer areas of Athens last month. Scientists say extreme weather is now driving the dropping lake level.</p>
<p>"It is an <strong>alarm bell</strong>," said Efthymis Lekkas, a professor of disaster management at the University of Athens. "We don't know what will happen in the coming period. If we have a rainless winter, things will get difficult."</p>
<p>Giannopoulos noted that the Mount Giona mountain that rises up from the lake used to be snow-covered. But it saw none last winter. Around the lake, some trees have taken on a yellowish color. "They lack water. This has never happened before," Giannopoulos said.</p>
<p>Wells in the area are now drying up, he added. And surrounding villages – which do not take water from the lake – suffered water cuts this summer. A local firefighter chief said the risk of wildfires increases as the forests become drier.</p>
<p>Satellite images suggest the lake's surface area shrank from around 16.8 square kilometers in August 2022 to just 12 this year.</p>
<p>In addition, water supplies at three other water bodies dropped to 700 million cubic meters in August. This water supplies Attica, an area of around 4 million people that includes Athens. That was down from 1.2 billion cubic meters in 2022, the country's environment ministry said.</p>
<p>The Greek government says the state-run Athens water company had begun supplying those areas with additional sources of water. Former residents of Kallio were surprised to see the village again. But some said they were saddened by its current state.</p>
<p>"I used to see it full and say it was a beach. Now all you see is dryness," said 90-year-old Konstantinos Gerodimos.</p>
<p>His 77-year-old wife Maria added: "If it continues like this, the entire village will appear, all the way to the bottom, where the church and our home was."</p>

<p>Now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>In life, there are times when we lose our way, both <strong>literally</strong> and <strong>figuratively</strong>.</p>
<p>We might get lost walking in the woods or sailing at sea. Those are examples of being literally lost. We could also lose our way while on our career path. That is an example of being figuratively lost.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A meteor streaks in the night sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower on the island of Lastovo, Croatia, Aug. 12, 2023. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-5a50-08db9c1fa6ad_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A meteor streaks in the night sky during the annual Perseid meteor shower on the island of Lastovo, Croatia, Aug. 12, 2023. </span></div>
<p>If you are physically lost and do not have a <strong>compass,</strong> you could use the stars in the night sky to know which way to go, especially the North Star.</p>
<p>Experts at NASA, America's space agency, say this about the North Star: “If you're in the Northern Hemisphere, it can help you <strong>orient </strong>yourself and find your way, as it's located in the direction of true north (or geographic north, as opposed to <strong>magnetic</strong> north).</p>
<p>They add that the North Star is not the brightest star in the sky. But it is usually easy to see, even from cities.</p>
<p>The North Star can also help if you get lost figuratively.</p>
<p>As the world changes around you and grows more complex, you can look to your North Star to help guide you. Your North Star can keep you <strong>focused</strong> and <strong>on track</strong>. It reminds you of what is important.</p>
<p>Some people may say their North Star is their <u>guiding light</u>. It is something very important to them, and it keeps them on the right path.</p>
<p>Your North Star can also be your personal <strong>mission statement. </strong>It can include your <strong>principles</strong> and guiding beliefs. Your North Star can give your life meaning and direction.</p>
<p>For some people, their North Star may be a religion. For others, it might be a purpose, like teaching people to read. Or a North Star can be a mix of important things.</p>
<p>A similar term for North Star is your <u>moral compass</u>. Like the North Star, a moral compass points you in the right direction.</p>
<p>There is another term that is linked to the North Star. A lodestar is also a star which is used to find one's way. And it can also mean a person who serves as an <strong>inspiration</strong>, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_UQvhQCJt">model</a> or guide.</p>
<p>The Merriam Webster online dictionary explains that both meanings of “lodestar” date back to the 1300s. The English poet Geoffrey Chaucer used both meanings of the word in his poems. However, by the 1600s, the literal meaning fell out of common use. Today, we still use “lodestar” in a figurative way meaning something or someone who guides us.</p>
<p>During a difficult or important time, many things can act as your North Star or lodestar.</p>
<p>For example, when a woman went through a difficult <strong>divorce</strong>, her close friend was her lodestar and helped her through it.</p>
<p>Another example might be when a music teacher and musician moved to a new city. He did not know anyone. He felt lost and alone. So, music was his North Star. It kept him busy, provided him with employment, and later led to great friendships with other musicians.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader Voice Can Speak Anew with AI (2024/9/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>During his more than 60-year acting career, James Earl Jones' voice became a star of its own. Jones died this week at the age of 93.</p>
<p>One of Jones' career decisions continues to be an issue of debate: his permission to let artificial intelligence (AI) reproduce his performances as Darth Vader for new projects.</p>
<p>Skywalker Sound and Ukrainian software company Respeecher used AI to recreate Jones' Darth Vader for the 2022 show <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>. The show appears on the streaming service Disney+.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - James Earl Jones arrives at the Tony Awards on June 12, 2016, in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f95e2016-256a-445b-b22b-71f5b0b20bd7_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - James Earl Jones arrives at the Tony Awards on June 12, 2016, in New York. (Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP, File)</span></div>
<p>The voice of actor Mark Hamill was also “de-aged” using Respeecher. Hamill played Luke Skywalker in the first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. His AI-manufactured voice was used in the series' television show <em>The Mandalorian</em>. Disney+ launched the show in 2019.</p>
<p>Voice actors say they fear AI could reduce the number of jobs because the technology can reproduce one performance into many. The concern led American unionized video game performers to go on strike in July.</p>
<p>For some observers, Jones' decision to permit AI to reproduce his voice raises questions about voice acting as an art. But the decision also could help develop AI agreements that fairly pay actors for AI-based performances.</p>
<p>Zeke Alton is a voice actor and member of SAG-AFTRA's interactive media agreement negotiating committee. He said it is “amazing” that Jones was involved in the process of reproducing his voice.</p>
<p>“If the game companies, the movie companies, gave the <strong>consent</strong>, <strong>compensation transparency</strong> to every actor that they gave James Earl Jones, we wouldn't be on strike,” Alton said. “It proves that they can do it. They just don't want to for people that they feel don't have the <strong>leverage</strong> to <strong>bargain</strong> for themselves.”</p>
<p>Hollywood's video game performers called for a strike after more than 18 months of negotiations over a new interactive media agreement with industry leaders. The negotiators could not reach an agreement on artificial intelligence protections.</p>
<p>Members of the union have said they are not opposed to AI. They say they are worried, however, that technology could replace them.</p>
<p>Concerns over such use of AI were among the reasons that film and television workers went on strike last year. The work stoppages went on for four months.</p>
<p>Neither Skywalker Sound nor Respeecher answered a request for comment from Associated Press reporters. But a sound editor with Skywalker Sound spoke to <em>Vanity Fair </em>magazine about the issue. The worker reported that Jones approved the use of old recordings to keep Darth Vader alive. The worker added that Jones guided the new performances.</p>
<p>Jones' contract could set an example of <strong>properly</strong> bargaining with an actor over their likeness, said Sarah Elmaleh. She is chair of SAG-AFTRA's interactive negotiating committee. Elmaleh, a voice actor, said there is a chance for these tools to be used in “meaningful, smart artistic decisions.”</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Renata in Brazil about the usage of the words “perhaps” and “maybe.”</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3c866149-fa04-4f35-8778-206251032463_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>I'm trying to learn English, but from now I [have] a question about what's the difference between "perhaps" and "maybe".</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Renata. I'm happy to answer this question.</p>
<p>The two words mean the same thing. We use them to express the idea that we are guessing or unsure about something. However, there are some differences in how we use the two words.</p>
<p>Language researchers use the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.english-corpora.org%2Fcoca%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CAndrewSmith%4021voa.com%7C749494b552994caa362908dcbcaf0592%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638592707116585301%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=16C39dnI2Wx52MxTMBgizzwHDhiORhP4RHKn8Zsskn8%3D&amp;reserved=0" title="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.english-corpora.org%2Fcoca%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7CAndrewSmith%4021voa.com%7C749494b552994caa362908dcbcaf0592%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C638592707116585301%7CUnknown%7CTWF">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> to study the usage of words. They have found that speakers of American English use “maybe” more than twice as often as the word “perhaps.” The Corpus contains over one billion words collected from American print, video, and audio media.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of “maybe:”</p>
<p><em>A: Are you going to the beach this weekend?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Maybe—but I need to check the weather first. </em></p>
<p>In this situation, if a speaker used the word “perhaps” instead of “maybe,” it might sound too formal, or serious, in American English.</p>
<p>However, in written English, we often use the word “perhaps” instead of “maybe.” You can find many examples of both of these words in stories on our website at <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/">www.21voa.com</a>.</p>
<p>In writing, we can use <strong>commas</strong> to place the word “perhaps” between <strong>phrases</strong> or <strong>clauses</strong> in a sentence. Consider this example:</p>
<p><em>It is easy, perhaps, to train a young dog to obey its owner. But training an older dog might not be so easy. </em></p>
<p>Note that if we put the word “maybe” in place of “perhaps” in this writing example, it might not seem like good writing to a native speaker.</p>
<p>Sometimes a writer will choose to use the word “maybe” instead of “perhaps” to communicate a particular feeling. Consider the following example:</p>
<p><em>Government officials say the new trade deal will help the economies of both countries. Maybe. Such predictions have often been wrong in the past. </em></p>
<p>Here, by using the word “maybe,” the writer communicates more strongly a feeling that the government officials might be wrong.</p>
<p>Finally, be careful not to confuse the <strong>adverb</strong> “maybe” with the verb phrase “may be.” You can learn more about this by reading the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/maybe-and-may-be-are-driving-me-crazy-/4807820.html"><em>Ask a Teacher</em> program called “Maybe and May Be Are ‘Driving Me Crazy.'"</a></p>

<p>Helium leaks have been a major problem for spacecraft and rockets.</p>
<p>Recent reports about Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission have involved problems controlling helium. Recently, the Starliner had a helium leak in a <strong>propulsion</strong> system. Polaris Dawn also had helium issues on its ground equipment.</p>
<p>Helium leaks have affected past <strong>missions </strong>including the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan 2 and the European Space Agency's Ariane 5.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this image provided by the European Space Agency, Europe's new rocket Ariane 6 launches from Kourou, French Guiana, Tuesday, July 9, 2024.

(Stephane Corvaja/European Space Agency via AP)</span></div>
<p>Recently, Reuters news agency explored why spacecraft and rockets use helium, and why it can cause problems:</p>
<p><strong>Why is helium used on spacecraft? </strong></p>
<p>Helium is inert, meaning it does not chemically react with other substances. It also does not burn. Helium's atomic number is 2, making it the second lightest element after hydrogen.</p>
<p>Rockets need to reach exact speeds and <strong>altitudes</strong> to maintain their orbits. Heavier rockets need more energy to fly and use more fuel. They also require more powerful engines, which are costlier to develop, test, and maintain.</p>
<p>Helium has an extremely low boiling point of -268.9 degrees Celsius. This means that it remains a gas even in extremely cold environments like space. That is an important quality because many rocket fuels are stored at low temperatures.</p>
<p>Helium is not<strong> toxic</strong>. But it cannot be breathed on its own because it displaces oxygen. Humans need oxygen to live.</p>
<p><strong>How is helium used in rockets? </strong></p>
<p>Because of its special qualities, helium is used to pressurize fuel tanks. It helps ensure fuel flows to the rocket's engines without stopping. Helium is also used for cooling systems.</p>
<p>As fuel and oxidizer are burned in the rocket's engines, helium fills the resulting empty space in the tanks, maintaining the correct pressure inside.</p>
<p>Because it is non-reactive, it can safely mix with other contents in the tanks.</p>
<p><strong>Is helium more likely to leak? </strong></p>
<p>Helium's small atomic size and low molecular weight mean its atoms can escape through small spaces or seals in storage tanks and fuel systems.</p>
<p>However, because there is very little helium in the Earth's atmosphere, leaks can be easily <strong>detected</strong>. This makes the gas important for identifying possible problems in a rocket or spacecraft's fuel systems.</p>
<p>In May, hours before Boeing's Starliner spacecraft made its first attempt to launch an astronaut crew, sensors inside the spacecraft detected a small helium leak. The American space agency NASA spent several days studying the leak before deciding it was low risk.</p>
<p>Additional leaks were detected in space after Starliner launched in June. Such discoveries played a part in NASA's decision to bring Starliner back to Earth without its crew.</p>
<p>As a result, two NASA astronauts who flew to the International Space Station aboard a Starliner capsule will need to return to Earth on a SpaceX vehicle early next year.</p>
<p>The <strong>frequency </strong>of helium leaks across space-related systems, some engineers say, has shown an industry-wide need for <strong>innovation</strong>. Innovation is needed in the design of valves and the mechanisms that tighten them. A valve is a mechanical device that controls the flow of a gas or fluid.</p>
<p><strong>Can another gas be used? </strong></p>
<p>Some rocket scientists have experimented with gases such as argon and nitrogen, which are also inert and can sometimes be less costly. Helium, however, is much more common in the space industry.</p>
<p>In Europe's new Ariane 6 rocket, designers replaced the helium that was used in the rocket's <strong>predecessor</strong> Ariane 5. The Ariane 6 has a new pressurization system. The new system changes a small amount of liquid oxygen and hydrogen <strong>propellants </strong>to gas, which then pressurizes those fluids for the rocket engine.</p>
<p>That system failed in space, however, during the final part of Ariane 6's otherwise successful launch in July. The failure of the new system added to the international rocket industry's list of pressurization difficulties.</p>

            <title>US School Shooting Raises Questions about Classroom Phone Bans (2024/9/13)</title>

<p>A mass shooting at an American high school has raised questions about policies restricting cellphone use in classrooms.</p>
<p>The shooting took place September 4 at Apalachee High School in the southern state of Georgia. The suspect was identified as Colt Gray, a 14-year-old student at the school. The shooting left two students and two teachers dead. Nine others were injured.</p>
<p>During the shooting, some students at Apalachee High School used cellphones to call their parents to let them know what was happening. Others made calls to loved ones to leave messages they thought might end up being final goodbyes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A family embraces during a vigil for the victims of the Apalachee High School shooting at Jug Tavern Park in Winder, Georgia, on September 4, 2024, after a shooting took place.

<p>Some opponents of cellphone bans in schools have said such situations demonstrate a reason cellphones should not be completely banned from classrooms. They believe phone bans can cut off a possible lifeline for parents to make sure their children are safe during school shootings or other emergencies.</p>
<p>But supporters of such restrictions – including many teachers – say the rules are needed. They say cellphones can cause many <strong>distractions</strong> for students.</p>
<p>Keri Rodrigues is president of the National Parents Union, an education activist group. She said she understands that parents “are deeply concerned about whether or not they're going to get timely information” about their kids in emergency situations.</p>
<p>Rodrigues told The Associated Press (AP), “The fact of the matter is parents and families cannot <strong>rely</strong> on schools to effectively communicate with us in times of emergency, and this has happened time and again.”</p>
<p>Nationwide, 77 percent of U.S. schools say they currently ban cellphones for non-school-related work. That number comes from the National Center for Education Statistics. But experts say the number is misleading and does not necessarily mean students are following the bans or that all schools are effectively enforcing them.</p>
<p>In the southern state of Arkansas, Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered school districts a state-supported financial assistance program. It helps administrators buy containers to hold students' phones during the school day.</p>
<p>In California, Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has urged school districts to restrict cellphone use. He is considering signing legislation that would require schools to enact restrictions.</p>
<p>Newsom recently told reporters, “I'd hate to see another school shooting be the reason that we bring TVs into the classroom and then disrupt our children's education.” He explained that permitting schoolchildren to have cellphones in school is almost like letting them watch television in class. Doing so, Newsom said, can “greatly <strong>disrupt</strong>” the learning process.</p>
<p>But opponents of phone bans say the device can be helpful for students facing dangerous situations at school. For example, some students caught in the Apalachee shooting were able to use their phones to contact loved ones during moments they feared could be their last.</p>
<p>One student, high school junior Julie Sandoval, told the AP she texted her mother from inside the school, “I love you. I love you so much...” In another message, she wrote, “I'm sorry I'm not the best daughter. I love you.”</p>
<p>Sandoval said she heard another student during the shooting speaking with her mother on the phone. She was heard saying, “They're shooting up the school! They're shooting up the school!”</p>
<p>But some supporters of phone restrictions warn that permitting students to use phones during shootings or other emergencies could put them in even more danger.</p>
<p>Kim Whitman is co-founder of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://phonefreeschoolsmovement.org/">Phone-Free Schools Movement</a>. The group supports school policies to keep cellphones out of students' hands during class. “What's even more important to me is their safety,” Whitman said. She noted, for example, that a child on the phone with a loved one during a school emergency might miss important guidance from teachers or school officials. “That's a worse <strong>scenario</strong> in my mind,” Whitman added.</p>
<p>Students in other school shootings have used cellphones to inform school officials or parents about the incidents. During the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas – which killed 21 people – a fourth-grader called 911 to get help. And during a 2018 shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students used their phones to communicate with loved ones and shoot video of the shooting.</p>

            <title>You Really Should Learn Modals! (2024/9/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/you-really-should-learn-modals-everyday-gramamr.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Adam Brock</span><br/><span class="datetime">12 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>
For VOA Learning English, this is Everyday Grammar.</p>
<p>This week we are going to show you how to give advice using <strong>modal verbs</strong>. Modal verbs (called <em>modals</em> for short) are <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong> that express a speaker's <strong>attitude</strong> and the strength of that attitude.</p>
<p>For example, "He should visit Prague."</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-acda-08dbbaced82d_w100_r1.png"/></div>
<p>In this sentence, <em>should</em> is the modal verb, and<em> visit</em> is the main verb.</p>
<p>The simple form of a verb goes after a modal. Do not add the third person "s" to a verb after a modal. It would sound strange to say, "He should visits Prague" or, "He should to visit Prague." The correct way is, "He should visit Prague."</p>
<p>There are about 17 modals in English — grammar experts do not agree on an exact number. Today we will focus on three common modals used for giving advice: <em>should, ought to, </em>and<em> had better.</em></p>
<p><strong>Using <em>should</em></strong></p>
<p>Let's start with <em>should</em>. <em>Should</em> has multiple meanings. It can be used to express <strong>certainty</strong>, such as, "He should be here by 5 o'clock." <em>Should</em> can be a substitute for the <strong>conditional</strong> word <em>if</em>. You might hear someone say, "Should you need help, just ask me."</p>
<p>But more often, we use<em> should</em> to give suggestions and friendly advice, such as, "You should apply for that job," or "You should try that new restaurant."</p>
<p>The past form of the modal <em>should</em> is <em>should have</em> + the past participle. For example, "I should have brought my wallet." Notice that the main verb <em>brought</em> is in the <strong>past participle</strong> form.</p>
<p>Use <em>should have</em> to express regret, or a negative feeling about the past. Imagine you trusted someone and that person later cheated on you. You could say, "I should have known better than to trust him." The Beatles used the expression in a popular song.</p>
<p><em>I should have known better with a girl like you<br/>
That I would love everything that you do<br/>
And I do<br/>
Hey hey hey</em></p>
<p><strong>Using <em>ought to</em></strong></p>
<p>The next modal we will talk about is <em>ought to</em>. <em>Ought to</em> is another modal for giving advice. Sometimes <em>ought to</em> sounds more like "otta" as in this romantic song by Al Green.</p>
<p><em>Sit back down and talk to me<br/>
About how you want to be<br/>
You ought to be with me<br/>
Yeah you ought to be with me</em></p>
<p><em>Ought to</em> is similar in meaning to <em>should</em>, but it is not used as often. In modern American English, <em>ought to</em> is seldom used with the past tense or in the question form.</p>
<p><strong>Using <em>had better</em></strong></p>
<p>Let's move on to <em>had better</em>. <em>Had better </em>is stronger than <em>should </em>and <em>ought to</em>. <em>Had better</em> carries an indirect threat.</p>
<p>For example, if you said, "You had better finish the report," you are not making a polite suggestion. You are making an indirect threat.</p>
<p>In other words, if you don't finish the report, you are in trouble. Authority figures sometimes use <em>had better</em> when speaking to people below them. Parents also use this form often.</p>
<p>Listen to cartoon character Malory Archer. Malory is the head of a spy agency. People think she is <strong>arrogant </strong>and heartless. Listen to her tone when she uses <em>had better</em>.</p>
<p><em>Oh for — I'll send up some help.<br/>
And Missy, you had better watch it!</em></p>
<p>As you can hear, Malory is not making a polite suggestion. She is threatening someone in a lower position.</p>
<p><em>Had better</em> is not always impolite, it could express a sense of urgency as in, "Your plane is leaving! You <em>had better</em> run!" In other words, "If you don't run, you will miss your flight." <em>Had better</em> has no past tense or question form.</p>
<p><strong>Modals in rapid speech</strong></p>
<p><em>Should, ought to, </em>and<em> had better</em> can be difficult for English learners to hear. Native speakers often shorten these words in casual conversation. In rapid speech, modals seem to disappear because they are shortened and often fall on <strong>unstressed syllables</strong>.</p>
<p>We will read some examples for you. The first sentence will be in slow, careful speech. Then we will read it again in rapid, informal speech.</p>
<p><em>I should have been listening to what she had to say.<br/>
I shoulda been listenin' ta what she had t' say.</em></p>
<p><em>You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<br/>
You otta be ashamed of yourself.</em></p>
<p><em>You had better decide what you want to do.<br/>
You'd better decide whatcha wanna do.</em></p>
<p>That's all the advice we have for you today. There is much more to learn about modals. We will cover them in more detail in future episodes. Until then, you should practice modals with British punk band, The Clash.</p>
<p><em>Darling you've got to let me know<br/>
Should I stay or should I go?<br/>
If you say that you are mine<br/>
I'll be here till the end of time<br/>
So you've got to let me know<br/>
Should I stay or should I go?</em></p>

            <title>World Produces 52 Million Metric Tons of Plastic Pollution Yearly (2024/9/12)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202409/world-produces-52-million-metric-tons-of-plastic-pollution-yearly.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">11 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The world creates about 52 million metric tons of plastic pollution every year, a new study says.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of that plastic comes from the Global South – a term that loosely describes developing countries.</p>
<p>The amount of pollution is enough to fill New York City's Central Park with plastic waste as high as the Empire State Building, researchers at the University of Leeds in Britain say.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A man walks on a railway track littered with plastic and other waste materials on Earth Day in Mumbai, India, April 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/e41552a7-912f-4c53-952c-8761a3211cfc_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">FILE - A man walks on a railway track littered with plastic and other waste materials on Earth Day in Mumbai, India, April 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool, File)</span></div>
<p>They examined waste produced on the local level at more than 50,000 cities and towns across the world for a study released recently in the publication Nature.</p>
<p>The study examined plastic that goes into the open environment. It did not examine plastic that goes into <strong>landfills</strong> or is properly burned. For 15 percent of the world's population, government fails to collect and <strong>dispose of </strong>waste, the study said.</p>
<p>This lack of collection and disposal is a big reason Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa produce the most plastic waste.</p>
<p>Lagos, Nigeria, released the most plastic pollution of any city, said Costas Velis, the study's lead writer. The other biggest plastic-polluting cities are New Delhi in India, Luanda in Angola, Karachi in Pakistan, and Cairo, in Egypt.</p>
<p>India leads the world in producing plastic pollution, with more than 9.3 million metric tons a year. That number is far more than double the next big-polluting nations, Nigeria and Indonesia. China, often criticized for pollution, is in fourth place but is making big improvements in reducing waste, Velis said. Other top plastic polluters are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia and Brazil. The top eight nations are responsible for more than half of the world's plastic pollution, the study's data suggests.</p>
<p>The United States takes 90th place in plastic pollution with more than 47,600 metric tons. And Britain takes 135th place with nearly 4,600 metric tons, the study says.</p>
<p>In 2022, most of the world's nations agreed to make the first legally <strong>binding</strong> treaty on plastic pollution, including in the oceans. Final treaty negotiations take place in South Korea in November.</p>
<p>The study used artificial intelligence to research plastics that were improperly burned — about 57 percent of the pollution — or just <strong>dumped</strong>. In both cases, very small microplastics, or nanoplastics, are what change the issue from a marine life problem to a human health threat, Velis said.</p>
<p>Several studies this year have looked at how common microplastics are in our drinking water and in people's tissue, such as hearts, brains and testicles. Doctors and scientists are still not quite sure how microplastics threaten human health.</p>
<p>Velis called the spread of microplastics “everybody's problem” and one that will be an issue for future generations.</p>
<p>“We shouldn't put the blame, any blame, on the Global South,” Velis said. “And we shouldn't praise ourselves about what we do in the Global North in any way.”</p>
<p>The problem is a lack of resources and ability of government to provide the necessary services to citizens, Velis said.</p>
<p>Outside experts worried that the study's attention on pollution, rather than overall plastic production, means the plastic industry is not held responsible.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/#:~:text=If%20historic%20growth%20trends%20continue,after%20a%20single%20short%20use." target="_blank">United Nations Environment Program estimates</a> that plastic production is likely to rise from about 400 million metric tons a year to more than 1.1 billion metric tons. And many scientists believe plastic production releases large amounts of greenhouse gas that contribute to climate change.</p>
<p>Neil Tangri is senior director of science and policy at GAIA, a group of international organizations working on waste and environmental programs.</p>
<p>Tangri said of the study's researchers, “These guys have defined plastic pollution in a much narrower way, as really just macroplastics that are <strong>emitted</strong> into the environment after the consumer, and it risks us losing our focus on the <strong>upstream</strong> and saying, hey now all we need to do is manage the waste better.”</p>
<p>Tangri added, “It's necessary but it's not the whole story.”</p>

            <title>Apple Launches New iPhone ‘Built for AI’ (2024/9/12)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">11 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Apple has launched its latest device, the iPhone 16. The company said it designed the new phone with the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology.</p>
<p>Apple announced four new iPhone 16 models during a launch event September 9 from its headquarters in Cupertino, California. It said the new models are equipped with special <strong>chips</strong> to support the increased power needed for AI operations.</p>
<p>Apple says the AI built into the devices is part of its newly developed Apple Intelligence technology. Apple leader Tim Cook spoke at the launch event. He said the new iPhone 16 models had been “designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The new iPhone 16 is displayed during an announcement of new products at Apple headquarters Monday, Sept. 9, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8a8f513c-5f28-492a-9409-d321f4dd6c5e_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The new iPhone 16 is displayed during an announcement of new products at Apple headquarters Monday, Sept. 9, 2024, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada)</span></div>
<p>Apple Intelligence is available to users of the new iPhone 16 models, as well as the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. Users must also be running iOS 18.1, which is expected to launch in October. Apple Intelligence can also be used with iPads and Macs.</p>
<p>The company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121115#:~:text=Apple%20Intelligence%20is%20the%20personal,you%2C%20while%20protecting%20your%20privacy.">describes the technology</a> as a “personal intelligence system” designed to help users “communicate, work, and express” themselves.</p>
<p>The new AI tools, or features, are designed to improve on past ones, including the company's 13-year-old Siri digital assistant. Company officials say they aim to get Siri to better understand requests and actions of the user.</p>
<p>One new feature of iPhone 16 models lets users search for pictures in their images collection by describing what an image looks like. AI tools can also help users create personal emojis and can organize and provide brief descriptions of emails. Other AI features include improved camera and video production <strong>functions</strong>.</p>
<p>The new iPhone models are also equipped with a new <strong>button</strong> that reacts to clicks and hand movements to make it easier and faster to set up shots, capture images and start video recording.</p>
<p>The company says the iPhone 16 models will be available for pre-order on September 13. But since the new AI tools require the iOS 18 update, users will have to wait until they receive that to use the features. Apple has said the iOS 18 release will roll out from October through December. American English will be the first available language, followed by more to be added next year.</p>
<p>The price for an iPhone 16 will start at just under $800. The top model will cost almost $1200.</p>
<p>Apple's push to include AI tools in its new devices is partly seen as a reaction to moves by competitors like Samsung and Google. Both of those companies have already offered users powerful new AI tools in their latest smartphone models.</p>
<p>In addition to the new AI features offered, Apple has also teamed up with ChatGPT developer OpenAI to give users the chance to use that company's technology for more complex operations. In June, Apple <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/apple-partners-with-openai-to-bring-ai-tools-to-ios-devices/7659640.html">announced</a> it was working with OpenAI to create a series of AI tools for iPhones and other personal devices.</p>
<p>Apple officials have noted that all users have the ability to turn off any AI tools they do not want. The company has long claimed it highly values personal privacy and says it has built tools into its operating systems to protect user data. Apple said it took the same steps to provide privacy protections for its new AI tools.</p>
<p>Besides announcing the new AI-equipped devices, Apple also introduced new models of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger and brighter <strong>display</strong> that aims to improve views from any position. The changes to Apple Watch also include additional health features, such as a sleep <strong>monitor</strong> tool that aims to identify the disorder sleep apnea.</p>
<p>Apple says the new AirPods 4 come with an improved chip for better audio quality, as well as more active noise cancellation. The devices are also equipped with a tool to help users find lost AirPods. It plays a sound when Apple's Find Me app is used to find lost devices.</p>

            <title>Turkey’s Homeless Dogs Find Families in Other Countries (2024/9/12)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A law that recently passed in Turkey requires the country's four million <strong>stray</strong> dogs to be impounded, or put in animal shelters. The legislation aims to place all strays into city shelters by 2028.</p>
<p>Supporters of the law, which passed in July, say it aims to prevent dog attacks, road accidents, and the spread of rabies.</p>
<p>But critics say the law may lead to many dogs being euthanized, or killed. Animal lovers, activists and organizations are working to find homes for Turkey's street dogs, including homes overseas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Deezi, a dog from a shelter in Istanbul, Turkey, walks with its new owners Caroline and Meike in Haarlem, Netherlands September 3, 2024. (REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b62760c9-361f-4955-917e-0621a6963b78_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Deezi, a dog from a shelter in Istanbul, Turkey, walks with its new owners Caroline and Meike in Haarlem, Netherlands September 3, 2024. (REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw)</span></div>
<p>Animal rights activist Nilgul Sayar runs a shelter for dogs near Istanbul. She has sent hundreds of dogs overseas for adoption. She said demand for international dog <strong>adoptions</strong> has jumped since the law passed.</p>
<p>"We have around 20 to 25 dogs ready to fly," Sayar said. "People continue to reach out to us (for adoption). I hope we will send more dogs soon. They will all have good homes."</p>
<p>It can take up to four months to get a dog ready to travel to the European Union with the necessary paperwork and vaccinations. And it can cost over $1,100.</p>
<p>Sayar said it often takes years to find homes for the large, old and disabled dogs that make up the majority of the animals in her shelter.</p>
<p>Dali and Deezi used to be stray dogs living on the streets of Istanbul. They were caught and put in Sayar's shelter. But today, Dali and Deezi live in the Netherlands, where they enjoy a comfortable life.</p>
<p>"We wanted to support these dogs and find loving families abroad," said Ali Okay, who volunteered to fly with them from Turkey to Belgium. The animals were later taken to the Netherlands by the non-governmental organization Animal Care Projects.</p>
<p>Dog shelters across Turkey can currently hold around 100,000 animals. Cities are to build more shelters to meet the requirements of the new law.</p>
<p>Thousands of Turks have protested against the law in recent weeks. Stray dogs and cats can be seen in streets across Turkey. They are loved and cared for by many people. Large stray dogs sometimes sleep in shop doorways, with people <strong>gently</strong> stepping around them.</p>
<p>In <strong>response</strong> to the new law, some companies are adopting strays for their offices. One hotel on the coast built a dog shelter to introduce them to foreign visitors. Some animal doctors are offering free vaccinations when people choose to adopt animals from the streets.</p>
<p>Turkey used to trap and <strong>neuter</strong> dogs and then return them to the streets. Critics of the new law say dog numbers would have been under control if that policy had been carried out.</p>
<p>Dali is now in a foster home in the Netherlands awaiting adoption. Deezi is settling into her new home and is calm and happy, said new owner Caroline Dieleman.</p>
<p>Dieleman was mourning the death of one of her dogs in June. When she heard about Turkey's new law, she decided to rescue Deezi.</p>
<p>"The new law makes me feel sick physically but also powerless," said Dieleman. "This was a little thing I could do...it is one dog only, from how many dogs. But one is better than none."</p>

            <title>US Colleges Report Effects of Ban on Race-based Admissions (2024/9/11)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Some top universities in the United States are reporting drops in the number of Black students in their incoming classes. At other colleges, including Princeton University and Yale University, the share of Black students changed little.</p>
<p>This fall's class is the first admitted since a Supreme Court ruling barred <strong>affirmative action </strong>in higher education.</p>
<p>Several schools have seen changes in numbers of Asian, Hispanic and Native American students, but trends are still unclear. Experts and colleges say it will take years to measure the full effect of the ruling.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Graduates of the University of North Carolina take pictures at the Old Well on campus in Chapel Hill, N.C., June 30, 2020.

<p>The end of affirmative action is not the only possible reason for the changing numbers. Some colleges are changing requirements, making test results more important. Earlier this year, there was a problem with the federal government's college financial aid process.</p>
<p>On September 5, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) reported drops in <strong>enrollment</strong> among Black, Hispanic and Native American students in its incoming class. It was one of the colleges at the center of the Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>The population of Black students dropped nearly 3 percentage points this fall, to 7.8 percent. Hispanic student enrollment fell from 10.8 percent to 10.1 percent, while the incoming Native American population fell half a percentage point to 1.1 percent, according to the university. The incoming Asian student population rose 1 percentage point to 25.8 percent. The share of white students, at 63.8 percent, hardly changed.</p>
<p>Rachelle Feldman is UNC's vice provost for enrollment. She said the delay in the student aid process was another possible influence on the enrollment numbers.</p>
<p>"We are <strong>committed</strong> to following the new law,” Feldman said. She also said the school administration is committed to making sure all North Carolina's students know that they are welcome at UNC and can succeed there.</p>
<p>Other universities reported sharp drops in Black student enrollment. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said the percentage of incoming Black students fell from 15 percent to 5 percent. Another Massachusetts school, Amherst College, reported the percentage fell from 11 percent to 3 percent.</p>
<p>At Tufts University in Massachusetts, the drop in the share of Black students was smaller, from 7.3 percent to 4.7 percent. At Yale, the University of Virginia and Princeton, the change year-over-year was less than a percentage point.</p>
<p>Changes in enrollment for other demographic groups were more mixed. At MIT, for example, the percentage of Asian students increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. However, its Hispanic and Latino percentage dropped from 16 percent to 11 percent. And MIT's percentage of white students stayed about the same.</p>
<p>But at Yale, the percentage of Asian students fell from 30 percent to 24 percent. White students at Yale went from 42 percent of the class to 46 percent. Hispanic and Latino students saw an increased representation of 1 percentage point.</p>
<p>Colleges have started looking for other ways to preserve the <strong>diversity</strong> they say is critical to university life.</p>
<p>JT Duck is head of admissions at Tufts University in Massachusetts. He said the school would work with community organizations to reach underrepresented, low-income students and students whose parents did not graduate from college. He suggested that people not worry too much about year-to-year changes in enrollment.</p>
<p>At UNC, vice provost Feldman said the university wants to make sure "anyone from any background knows they can earn their way here."</p>
<p>Katharine Meyer works at the Brookings Institution. She said it is hard to tell which policy change is having a greater effect. But so far, she said, the drops in underrepresented minority students are smaller than in previous cases. California passed a ban on affirmative action in 1995 and Michigan did so in 2014. But since those bans, Meyer said, colleges have developed more effective, non-race-based ways of <strong>recruiting</strong> and enrolling a diverse class.</p>

            <title>UN: Schools in Gaza Are Closed as Fighting Continues (2024/9/11)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The new school year in the Palestinian territories officially began on Monday. But all schools in Gaza are closed after 11 months of war. There is no sign of a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Israel gave new orders to people in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes. The order came after rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza.</p>
<p>Umm Zaki has a son, Moataz, who is 15 years old. He was supposed to begin 10th grade. Instead, he woke up in the family's tent in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Water is more than one kilometer away from the tent.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Palestinian students attend a class in a tent in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, September 4, 2024.

<p>The mother of five told Reuters by text message, "Usually, such a day would be a day of celebration, seeing the children in the new <strong>uniform</strong>, going to school, and dreaming of becoming doctors and engineers. Today all we hope is that the war ends before we lose any of them."</p>
<p>The Palestinian Education Ministry said all Gaza schools were closed and 90 percent of them had been destroyed or damaged in the war. The war started after Hamas gunmen attacked Israeli towns on October 7 killing about 1,200 people.</p>
<p>The U.N. Palestinian aid agency UNRWA operates about half of Gaza's schools. Many of them are now emergency shelters housing thousands of displaced families.</p>
<p>UNRWA Director of Communications Juliette Touma told Reuters, "The longer the children stay out of school the more difficult it is for them to catch up on their lost learning.” She added that they are then more likely to become “a lost generation.” They are at risk for the dangers of “child marriage, child labor, and <strong>recruitment</strong> into armed groups."</p>
<p>The education ministry said there are already 625,000 Gazans registered for school who would be missing classes. Another 58,000 six year olds should have registered to start first grade this year.</p>
<p>Last month, the UNRWA started a back-to-learning program in 45 of its shelters. Teachers set up games, <strong>drama</strong>, arts, music and sports activities to help with children's mental health.</p>
<p><strong>Order to evacuate</strong></p>
<p>Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been forced from their homes at least once. Some have had to flee 10 times.</p>
<p>In the latest <strong>evacuation</strong> order, Israel told residents of an area in the northern Gaza Strip that they must leave their homes. Rockets had been fired from there into southern Israel the day before.</p>
<p>The United Nations urged Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip to attend medical centers to get children under the age of 10 years old vaccinated against polio. There have been breaks in the fighting to permit a vaccination campaign. The U.N. hopes to vaccinate 640,000 children in Gaza. The territory's first polio case in around 25 years was recently reported.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said the campaign in the southern and central Gaza Strip had so far reached more than half of the children there needing the vaccine. Four weeks later, the children must get a second vaccination to complete the treatment.</p>
<p>Touma, the U.N. official, said 450,000 of the children targeted by the campaign had been vaccinated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><p>American actor James Earl Jones died Monday. He was 93 years old.<br/>
美国演员詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯周一去世。享年93岁。</p>
<p>His agent, Barry McPherson, said Jones died at his home in the Hudson Valley area of New York. The cause of death was not reported.<br/>
他的经纪人巴里·麦克弗森表示，琼斯在纽约哈德逊谷地区的家中去世。死因尚未公布。</p>
<p>Jones was probably most famous around the world for his performance as Darth Vader in the Star Wars movie series.<br/>
琼斯可能因在《星球大战》系列电影中饰演达斯·维德而闻名于世。</p>
<p>In interviews, Jones said he loved playing the part of Darth Vader, and of being part of the Star Wars story. "When I walk out tonight there will be kids with posters to sign,” he once said.<br/>
在采访中，琼斯说他喜欢扮演达斯·维德这个角色，也喜欢成为《星球大战》故事的一部分。他曾说过：“当我今晚走出家门时，会有孩子们拿着海报签名。”</p>
<p>“I love it. I love that I was a part of that cult."<br/>
“我喜欢这个。我喜欢自己成为那种狂热的一部分。”</p>
<p>His deep and powerful voice took on a career of its own.<br/>
他深沉而有力的嗓音走上了自己的职业生涯。</p>
<p>Jones voiced the part of Mufasa in The Lion King. He won a Grammy award in 1977 for the spoken word album, Great American Documents.<br/>
琼斯为《狮子王》中的木法沙配音。1977年，他凭借诵读专辑《伟大的美国文献》获得格莱美奖。</p>
<p>But the voice did not come naturally to Jones. As a child, he suffered from a severe speech problem.<br/>
但琼斯的声音并不是与生俱来。小时候，他患有严重的言语障碍。</p>
<p>James Earl Jones was born in the state of Mississippi in 1931. He had a severe stutter. As a result, he mostly stopped speaking.<br/>
詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯于1931年出生于密西西比州。他严重口吃。因此，他基本上不太说话。</p>
<p>He moved to Michigan when he was six. His grandparents became his legal guardians and raised him there.<br/>
他六岁时搬到了密歇根州。他的祖父母成为了他的法定监护人，并在那里抚养他长大。</p>
<p>In high school, Jones recovered his voice through his own poetry and the guidance of a teacher. Jones began to read his poems aloud to the class. His speaking improved.<br/>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 September, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A European climate service says summer 2024 was the hottest on record. The declaration makes it even more likely that this year will also turn out to be the warmest ever measured.</p>
<p>The summer heat data came from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/about-us">Copernicus</a> aims to provide detailed data on “past, present and future climate in Europe and the rest of the world.”</p>
<p>The service said that during the months of June, July and August, temperatures worldwide averaged 16.8 degrees Celsius. That was 0.03 degrees warmer than in 2023.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Children cool off as they play on a fountain at Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, in Athens, Greece, July 18, 2024.

<p>Copernicus records only date back to 1940. But American, British and Japanese records go back to the mid-19th century. Those records suggest the last 10 years have been the hottest since official climate data measurements started.</p>
<p>Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo told The Associated Press the Augusts in both 2024 and 2023 tied for the hottest Augusts at 16.82 degrees Celsius. The service reported July was the first time in more than a year that the world did not set a record. But because June 2024 was so much hotter than June 2023, this summer as a whole was the hottest, it said.</p>
<p>Buontempo noted that the high temperatures also likely pushed air <strong>humidity</strong> levels to record highs during the past summer.</p>
<p>The Copernicus chief said all the latest data suggests 2024 will likely break the record for the warmest year ever recorded. “In order for 2024 not to become the warmest on record, we need to see very significant <strong>landscape</strong> cooling for the remaining few months,” Buontempo added. But he noted, that “doesn't look likely.”</p>
<p>Climate scientists say the record temperatures have real <strong>consequences</strong> for many people around the planet.</p>
<p>Jonathan Overpeck is a climate scientist at the University of Michigan. He told the AP the continued warming will lead to “more misery around the world” in places seeing the most extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>Overpeck suggested Phoenix, Arizona as an example. The southwestern American city has already experienced more than 100 days of temperatures over 37.8 degrees Celsius this year.</p>
<p>“With longer and more severe heat waves come more severe <strong>droughts</strong> in some places, and more intense rains and flooding in others,” he said. “Climate change is becoming too <strong>obvious</strong>, and too costly, to ignore,” Overpeck added.</p>
<p>Jennifer Francis is a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. She said more communities worldwide are now having to deal with “violent and dangerous” conditions that include extreme heat, floods, wildfires and high winds.</p>
<p>In an email to the AP, Francis compared people living in areas with extreme climate to those living in conflict areas. She said that in both cases, people get so used to the situation they can become “<strong>deaf</strong>” to the severe conditions surrounding them every day.</p>
<p>Copernicus chief Buontempo noted an El Ni<i></i>241;o weather system fueled part of last year's record heat. El Ni<i></i>241;o is a warming of surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean. The event usually causes hot, dry weather in Asia and Australia. It can also drive weather changes in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>But the El Ni<i></i>241;o effect has ended, Buontempo said. Now, human-caused climate change from fossil fuel use is again the main driver of increased temperatures, he said.</p>
<p>“It's really not surprising that we see this, this heat wave, that we see these temperature extremes,” Buontempo said. “We are <strong>bound</strong> to see more.”</p>

            <title>How Bad Are Ultraprocessed Foods? (2024/9/10)</title>

<p>Most Americans eat ultraprocessed foods every day. These are foods that you cannot make at home because they contain flavors and chemicals that change the taste or feel of the food.</p>
<p>Such food may also go through preparation methods that are not possible in a home kitchen. They are usually high in salt, sugar and fat. Americans may eat them in the form of sugary cereals at breakfast, frozen pizzas at dinner, and in-between bites like potato chips, sodas and ice cream.</p>
<p>Ultraprocessed foods make up about 60 percent of the American diet. For children and teenagers, it is even higher – about two-thirds of what they eat.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A customer makes a purchase at a convenience store in Boston in this July 12, 2005 file photo. (AP Photo/Lisa Poole, file)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-795e-08dcc9034574_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A customer makes a purchase at a convenience store in Boston in this July 12, 2005 file photo.

<p>Scientists have connected eating ultraprocessed foods to poor health results. Being overweight is one such result and that may lead to diabetes and heart disease. Other possible health risks include depression and <strong>dementia</strong>. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.</p>
<p>Nutrition science is complex, though, and most research so far has found connections -- not proof -- regarding the health effects of these foods.</p>
<p>Food manufacturers argue that processing increases food safety and food supplies. They say it also offers a low-cost, easy way to provide a <strong>diverse</strong> and nutritious diet.</p>
<p>The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts to explain these foods so that people can make informed choices.</p>
<p><strong>What are ultraprocessed foods?</strong></p>
<p>Most foods are processed, whether it is by freezing, grinding, <strong>fermentation</strong>, <strong>pasteurization</strong> or other means. In 2009, Brazilian <strong>epidemiologist</strong> Carlos Monteiro and his team first proposed a way to classify foods by how much they are processed, not by their nutrient content. This is called the Nova classification system. It is used by international bodies like the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Kevin Hall is a researcher who studies <strong>metabolism</strong> and diet at the National Institutes of Health. He said that foods at the top of the Nova four-level <strong>scale</strong> are foods prepared with industrial processes and ingredients such as additives, colors and <strong>preservatives</strong> that you could not use in a home kitchen.</p>
<p>"These are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see," Hall said.</p>
<p><strong>Are ultraprocessed foods harmful?</strong></p>
<p>Not all processing is unhealthy, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant <strong>formula</strong> are all highly processed, for example. But they are also nutritious.</p>
<p>Still, many studies suggest that diets high in ultraprocessed foods are tied to poor health results. The exact cause is still unclear.</p>
<p>Hall and his partners carried out a small study with 20 people who came to live at a health center for a month. Some of the people ate ultraprocessed foods, while others ate unprocessed foods. The two groups got the same amount of calories, sugar, fat, fiber and nutrients for two weeks. They could eat as much as they liked.</p>
<p>When people ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they took in about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found. They gained an average of about 1 kilogram during the study period. People who ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time lost about 1 kilogram.</p>
<p>A new study is currently taking place and its results should appear next year.</p>
<p><strong>Should ultraprocessed foods be regulated?</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Neena Prasad is director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies' Food Policy Program. She said such foods are often made to be both low-cost and very tasty.</p>
<p>"You just can't stop eating them," Prasad said. She said she believes leaders have enough facts to change policies. This could mean raising taxes on sugary drinks, limiting salt in these foods and controlling how advertisers sell the foods to children.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf told a group of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are a complex subject. However, Califf said, "We've got to have the scientific basis and then we've got to follow through."</p>
<p><strong>How should consumers manage ultraprocessed foods at home?</strong></p>
<p>Aviva Musicus is science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She said buyers should check information printed on food containers and make choices based on the current U.S. Dietary Guidelines.</p>
<p>"We have really good evidence that added sugar is not great for us. We have evidence that high-<strong>sodium</strong> foods are not great for us," she said.</p>
<p>Musicus added, "We have great evidence that fruits and vegetables which are <strong>minimally</strong> processed are really good for us."</p>

            <title>Could Electricity for Bitcoin Mining Become Energy for AI? (2024/9/9)</title>

<p>U.S. technology companies are increasingly purchasing or<strong> leasing</strong> energy <strong>assets</strong> held by <strong>bitcoin</strong> miners.</p>
<p>These moves come as technology companies hurry to secure a supply of electricity for their growing artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing data centers.</p>
<p>Those data centers are driving the fastest increase in U.S. electricity demand since 2000. The demand is growing faster than the <strong>electricity grid</strong>. That means big technology companies, like Amazon and Microsoft, are aiming to secure large amounts of electricity.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A group of buildings housing cryptocurrency miners sits in the foreground of a power generating station at the Scrubgrass Plant in Kennerdell, Pennsylvania, U.S., March 8, 2022.

<p>Growing power demand is affecting the cryptocurrency mining industry – an industry that uses a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Some miners are making a profit by leasing or selling their power-connected <strong>infrastructure </strong>and centers. But other miners cannot get enough electricity to stay in business.</p>
<p>Greg Beard is chief of Stronghold Digital Mining, a publicly traded bitcoin mining company based in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>"The AI battle for <strong>dominance </strong>is a battle being had by the biggest and best <strong>capitalized </strong>companies in the world and they care like their lives depend on it that they win," he said. "Do they care about what they pay for power? Probably not."</p>
<p>Electric Power Research Institute is a non-profit energy research company based in Palo Alto, California. It said in May that data centers could use up to nine percent of total electricity produced in the U.S. by 2030. That is more than double their current use. This change comes as technology companies are paying a lot to grow their computing centers.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that data centers currently account for about 1 to 1.3 percent of world electricity use. Crypto mining uses 0.4 percent. The IEA says that difference is expected to grow.</p>
<p>Experts expect 20 percent of bitcoin mining power<strong> capacity</strong> to move to AI by the end of 2027. Over the past year, bitcoin miners have increasingly competed with AI data center owners for the same power production centers and business deals. That is what heads of more than six publicly traded U.S. crypto mining companies told Reuters.</p>
<p>One example took place in Pennsylvania. Marathon Digital Holdings is the world's biggest publicly traded bitcoin miner. Two <strong>sources</strong> who know about the situation said the company was among those considering a nuclear-powered data center owned by Talen Energy in Pennsylvania. But technology company Amazon bought the center in a deal announced in March.</p>
<p>Many large miners that own land and are connected to power centers are changing the way they do business. They are marketing their property and energy services to AI and cloud computing companies and doing less crypto mining.</p>
<p>"We've gotten a lot of interest from everyone from an Amazon or Google," said Kerri Langlais. He is an official for bitcoin miner TeraWulf. The company has a center in New York that can produce 770 megawatts of electricity.</p>
<p>Core Scientific is a crypto miner that a court recently permitted to restructure after its earlier financial failure. In June, Core Scientific became the first bitcoin miner to announce a major agreement. The deal was to lease its power-connected production centers to the company CoreWeave, which is supported by Nvidia. The deals are estimated to be worth more than $6.7 billion over 12 years.</p>
<p>Several miners have since said they would lease or act as <strong>subcontractors</strong> to develop AI data centers.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said providing electricity for AI and cloud computing could be profitable for big crypto miners. The investment bank said it could make their centers as much as five times more valuable.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also said technology companies could save billions of dollars by buying or leasing space from a miner with at least 100 megawatts of electricity production. It said such deals could cut the wait times for a data center to launch by about 3.5 years.</p>

<p>A private space <strong>mission</strong> will seek to launch non-astronauts to a high orbit and include the first private spacewalks in history.</p>
<p>The American space company SpaceX's flight is cleared to launch from Florida's Kennedy Space Center beginning September 7. The American space agency NASA operates the center. The exact launch date will depend on weather conditions.</p>
<p>American businessman Jared Isaacman organized and paid for the mission, called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://polarisprogram.com/dawn/" target="_blank">Polaris Dawn</a>. He and three people will crew the mission. Isaacman is the head of payment processing company Shift4Payments. He has an estimated personal worth of $2 billion. But he has not said publicly how much he paid SpaceX for the Polaris Dawn mission.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Anna Menon, Scott Poteet, Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis, crew members of Polaris Dawn, a private human spaceflight mission, attend a press conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S. August 19, 2024.

<p>The crewmembers will travel in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The company expects the spacecraft to reach an altitude of about 1,400 kilometers. That would be the highest any crewed mission has reached since NASA's Apollo program ended in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Isaacman is the mission commander for Polaris Dawn. Also taking part in the flight will be Scott Poteet, a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and two SpaceX employees, Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon. Gillis is a mission specialist at SpaceX, while Menon is a lead space operations engineer. The crew is expected to spend five days in orbit.</p>
<p>Polaris Dawn will reach its highest altitude on its first day. The Crew Dragon will briefly enter the Van Allen radiation belt, an area filled with high-energy charged particles that can present health risks to humans over extended periods.</p>
<p>This will provide a chance to test the effectiveness of SpaceX's newly designed spacesuits. SpaceX says the clothing is equipped with data instruments, cameras and improved <strong>mobility</strong> systems. SpaceX says tests of the spacesuit will help the company design and develop future space missions to the moon and Mars.</p>
<p>A statement by SpaceX <a class="wsw__a" href="https://polarisprogram.com/dawn/">said</a> one main goal of Polaris Dawn will be to carry out research “with the aim of better understanding the effects of spaceflight and space radiation on human health.”</p>
<p>Speaking about the mission's risks, Isaacman told reporters, "Whatever risk is <strong>associated</strong> <strong>with</strong> it, it is worth it." He added, "We have no idea what it could do to really change the <strong>trajectory</strong> of humankind ... there has to be some first steps in this direction."</p>
<p>The crew will orbit nearly three times higher than the International Space Station (ISS). But this is far short of the record-breaking distance of over 399,117 kilometers set by NASA's Apollo 13 crew in 1970.</p>
<p>Isaacman is expected to guide the other crew members on the mission's planned spacewalk on day three of the mission. Each member is expected to spend about 20 minutes in space.</p>
<p>So far, only government astronauts from the U.S., former Soviet Union and Russia, the European Space Agency, Canada and China have carried out spacewalks. More than 270 spacewalks, using American and Russian spacesuits, have been carried out from the ISS since its launch in 2000, Reuters news agency reports.</p>
<p>The next day will be spent testing laser-based satellite communication between the spacecraft and Starlink, SpaceX's internet satellite system. The laser method – which has also been tested by NASA – is designed to greatly increase space communication speeds.</p>
<p>The crew also plans to carry out 40 experiments aimed at improving our understanding of human health during long space missions. Among these will be tests with special contact lenses containing microelectronics that can continuously identify changes in eye pressure and shape.</p>
<p>At the end of the mission, Crew Dragon will aim for a parachute landing off the coast of Florida. A SpaceX recovery ship will be waiting for the crew's arrival.</p>
<p>Polaris Dawn is the first of three planned missions under the Polaris program. The second Polaris mission will also use a Dragon capsule, while the third and final is expected to use SpaxeX's Starship rocket. SpaceX chief Elon Musk has said his company plans to use Starship to carry future space travelers to the moon and Mars.</p>

<p>In the war-damaged streets of northern Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, 15-year-old Youssef Saad rides his bicycle with his musical instrument <strong>strapped</strong> on his back. The instrument he carries is called an oud. The sound of the oud is common in much Middle Eastern music.</p>
<p>Saad is bringing his instrument to a day center for children in the camp. There, he plays the oud and sings for children who have suffered through 11 months of war.</p>
<p>Saad says he tries to offer the children a little happiness or a way to temporarily forget about their difficult situation.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this frame captured from video, Palestinian teenager Youssef Saad sits on the rubble of his house as he plays oud to bring joy to children, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip September 2, 2024.

<p>"The homes in my city were once full of dreams," Saad said. As he spoke, he looked at the destroyed buildings in the refugee camp. Before the war, the refugee camp had a large population. “Now, they're gone,” he said.</p>
<p>Saad was studying music at the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music in nearby Gaza City before the war started. Like many other buildings, the conservatory was destroyed during the fighting. Saad and his four <strong>siblings</strong> are now living with relatives after his own home was destroyed.</p>
<p>Saad's father, a government worker with the Palestinian Authority, always supported Saad's dream of becoming a musician. Saad now centers his efforts on playing his oud and singing at the Jabalia center for children.</p>
<p>The war started after the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year. Hamas terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 250 hostages from southern Israel, according to Israeli estimates.</p>
<p>Since then, Israel has sought to destroy Hamas in Gaza. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, almost 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict. Airstrikes and fighting have destroyed thousands of buildings in Gaza.</p>
<p>"Every house holds a tragedy," Saad said. "Some have lost their mother, others their father, their neighbor, or their friend."</p>
<p>Even with the danger, Saad has a strong desire to continue his work with the children.</p>
<p>"We try to help improve their mental health, even if it means putting myself at risk," he said. "This is my duty to the children."</p>
<p>Saad added that he lives by an expression that carries him through the darkest days: "If you live, live free, or die standing like trees."</p>
