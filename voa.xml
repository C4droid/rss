        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">22 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>An international group of astronomers has joined efforts seeking to establish a separate time zone for the moon.</p>
<p>The French-based International Astronomical Union (IAU) recently approved a resolution on the matter during the group's General Assembly meeting in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>The resolution calls on space organizations around the world to cooperate on establishing a <strong>standard </strong>clock for the moon.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An aircraft passes in front of the moon, with a red glow attributable to smoke particles carried in the upper atmosphere from North American wildfires, a day ahead of the full super moon, as seen from Parliament Hill in London, Britain, August 18, 2024.

<p>The moon's orbital movements around Earth make one day on the lunar surface equal to 29.5 Earth days. And because the moon has less gravity compared to Earth, time moves slightly faster there, about 58.7 microseconds quicker each day.</p>
<p>Susan Stewart is an astronomer with the U.S. Naval Observatory. She helped create the resolution at the IAU conference. Stewart told The Associated Press the aim of the measure is quite simple: “To work together to establish (a) standard time.”</p>
<p>Currently, moon operations run on the time of the country that is launching spacecraft. But supporters of creating a separate time zone say this method will have to change; more countries and private space companies are starting to launch their own moon missions.</p>
<p>Last year, the European Space Agency (ESA) pushed for the creation of a lunar clock. And earlier this year, the White House directed the U.S. space agency NASA and other agencies to come up with a timekeeping plan for the moon by the end of 2026.</p>
<p>ESA noted communication and navigation systems built for the moon will perform much better if they use “the same timescale.” In addition, a separate time zone will support “the many other crewed and uncrewed missions” planned for the future, ESA said.</p>
<p>In the past, NASA also considered establishing a separate time zone for the International Space Station (ISS). But the agency decided against it. Instead, the ISS runs on Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, which is based on time kept by atomic clocks. NASA officials say this system helps ease the time difference between NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, as well as other space partners in Russia, Japan and Europe.</p>
<p>The international team looking at establishing a lunar time zone has said it is still deciding whether a single organization should be chosen to set and keep time on the moon.</p>
<p>Bijunath Patla is a physicist at the U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology. He told the AP that astronomers are still deciding on how a lunar clock would work. Patla said, “I think the community has realized that this needs to be done. And this is the beginning.”</p>

            <title>Australia Moves Forward with Major Renewable Energy Project (2024/8/23)</title>

<p>A plan to build a huge solar farm in Australia is a step closer after the Australian government gave environmental approvals for the $19 billion project recently.</p>
<p>Australian company Sun Cable plans to build a 12,400-hectare solar farm in a remote area of northern Australia. The farm will send electricity to the city of Darwin via an 800-kilometer overhead transmission line. Then the power will be transported to large industrial <strong>customers</strong> in Singapore through a 4,300-kilometer submarine cable.</p>
<p>The Australia-Asia PowerLink project aims to deliver up to 6 gigawatts of green electricity each year. Such a project, Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek suggested, would “help turn Australia into a renewable energy superpower” and<strong> boost</strong> its economy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Williamsdale Solar Farm, shown from the air and located south of Canberra, Australia, on Oct. 15, 2020, has about 30 hectares (74 acres) of solar panels.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP Image via AP)</span></div>
<p>Plibersek said in a written statement, “It will be the largest solar <strong>precinct</strong> in the world...”</p>
<p>The project was first backed by Australian mining businessman Andrew Forrest and Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes. The plans were discussed during a state visit by then-Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as part of a “Green Economy” agreement in 2022.</p>
<p>In January 2023, the project collapsed when Sun Cable was involved in a financing dispute between Forrest and Cannon-Brookes. By May of that year, a group led by Cannon-Brookes' Grok Ventures acquired the company, finalizing the takeover in September 2023.</p>
<p>SunCable Australia's managing director Cameron Garnsworthy said it was pleased to have cleared a major legal issue. He added that the company will now put its efforts into the next stage of planning to work towards "a Final Investment Decision targeted by 2027.”</p>
<p>The company said electricity supply would begin in the early 2030s.</p>
<p>Energy has been a politically charged issue for nearly 20 years in Australia. The country depends on coal and gas as well as money from exporting those fuels to help support its economy.</p>
<p>This dependence on <strong>fossil fuels</strong> has historically made it one of the world's worst <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> emitters on a per capita basis.</p>
<p>Australia's main opposition party in June announced plans to build the country's first nuclear power plants as early as 2035. The announcement ensures the major parties will be divided on how to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions at elections due within a year.</p>
<p>The parties have not gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007.</p>

            <title>Is It Harris' or Harris's? (2024/8/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The battle for the White House is set as Vice President Kamala Harris officially accepts the Democratic Party nomination on Thursday to run against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>However, another fight is just starting among grammar <strong>nerds</strong> over where to put the possessive <strong>apostrophe</strong> after her name. Is it <u>Harris'</u> or <u>Harris's</u>?</p>
<p>Eric Turkewitz, a New York lawyer, called the debate <a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/Turkewitz/status/1820814762336227836">“apostrophe hell”</a> on the social media website X. It has since received more than 2 million views.</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-a3ab-08dcc1fcf821_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>The <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em> says, “Use only an apostrophe” for singular proper names ending in the letter “s,” such as Dickens' book, Hercules' labors, or Jesus' life. So, for Harris, it is Harris, followed by an apostrophe, as in “<u>Harris'</u> policy.”</p>
<p>The <em>AP Stylebook</em> is widely used as the <strong>standard</strong> by American news organizations. But not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Three large U.S. newspapers, <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post,</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> all use Harris, followed by an apostrophe and the letter “s,” as in “<u>Harris's</u> policy.”</p>
<p>Adding to the <strong>confusion</strong>, they all agree that the singular possessive for Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, is <u>Walz's</u>. As for plural possessive, it is <u>Harrises'</u> as in <u>Harrises'</u> family home and <u>Walzes'</u> as in <u>Walzes'</u> cats.</p>
<p>Benjamin Dreyer is a retired <strong>editor</strong> who worked for the publisher Random House. He wrote <em>Dreyer's English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style</em>. He told the AP there is widespread agreement that <u>Walz's</u> is correct. But many flooded him with questions about what to do with the apostrophe after Harris.</p>
<p>Add the apostrophe and the letter “s,” Dryer said. “To set the 's is just simpler, and then you can take your valuable brain cells and apply them to more important things.”</p>
<p><strong>Not so fast!</strong></p>
<p>The American dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster <a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/MerriamWebster/status/1820874029202284562">joined the debate</a> with this reminder: “For names that end in an s or z sound, you can either add -'s or just an apostrophe. Going with -'s is the more common choice: the car that belongs to Jones → Jones's car or Jones' car.”</p>
<p>Amanda Barrett is AP's vice president for news standards and inclusion. She said, while the AP style has <strong>evolved</strong> over the years, there are no plans to change the guidance on the possessive apostrophe “s.”</p>
<p>Barrett added, “We do know that the <strong>conversation</strong> is out there and people make different choices when it comes to grammar, and that's all fine. Everyone makes a choice that works best for them.”</p>
<p>Timothy Pulju teaches linguistics at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He said that until the 17th or 18th <strong>century</strong>, the possessive of proper names ending in the letter “s” - such as Jesus or Moses - often was simply the name itself with no apostrophe or additional “s.” Eventually, the apostrophe (Jesus' or Moses') was added to mark the possession although the pronunciation remained the same.</p>
<p>“That became kind of the standard that I was taught and <strong>adhere</strong> to, even though <strong>in retrospect</strong>, I don't think it's a great standard,” he said.</p>
<p>Pulju expects most people will use the apostrophe followed by the letter “s” form over time. “As long as people are communicating successfully, we say language is doing what it's supposed to be doing,” he said. “If you can read it whichever way it's written, then it seems like it's working for people...”</p>
<p>Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts was the last U.S. presidential candidate whose name ended with the letter “s.” Dukakis told the AP that he does not remember any similar discussion when he was the Democratic nominee. But he agrees with the AP.</p>
<p>“It sounds to me like it would be s, apostrophe, and that's it,” he said.</p>
<p>If Harris wins in November, she would become the fourth U.S. president with a last name ending in the letter “s” and the first since Rutherford B. Hayes, who was elected in 1876.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign has yet to take a clear position. Press releases issued by the campaign talked about “Harris's positive vision,” and “Harris' seventh trip to Nevada.”</p>

            <title>Tech Tip: How to Keep Your Chatbot Activity More Private (2024/8/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202408/tech-tip-how-to-keep-your-chatbot-activity-more-private.mp3"/>

<p>Operators of artificial intelligence (AI) <strong>chatbot</strong> tools have made it clear that users' requests can be saved and used to further develop the AI systems.</p>
<p>But what if a user does not want that? Some tools permit users to request that personal information used in chatbot requests not be saved or used to develop or train AI systems.</p>
<p>Technology experts say it could be too late for users who have already provided information to these tools to have the data removed. But the Associated Press is offering the following advice for users who want to increase their privacy protections.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Barbara Winston uses a computer at her home in Northbrook, Ill., on Sunday, June 30, 2024, several days after taking an introduction to artificial intelligence class at a local senior center.

<p><strong>Google Gemini</strong></p>
<p>Google saves chatbot interactions, known as conversations<strong>,</strong> with its Gemini tool. The company says it uses the data to train its machine learning systems. But the company does give users a way to limit the information captured and to remove past conversations.</p>
<p>For users 18 or older, requests are kept for 18 months, although this can be changed in user settings. Human workers are sometimes used by Google to examine some user conversations as part of efforts to improve Gemini's systems. In general, Google warns Gemini users not to enter any sensitive information they do not want human workers to see.</p>
<p>Gemini users can change or “opt-out” of these <strong>default</strong> settings. From the main Gemini website <a class="wsw__a" href="https://gemini.google.com/?hl=en">page</a>, users should find and click on the “Activity” button toward the bottom left of the page. From there, they can click the “Turn off” <strong>button</strong> next to the heading “Gemini Apps Activity.” Users then have the chance to block future conversations from being saved. They can also choose to have all previous conversations removed.</p>
<p>Whether a user chooses to turn their activity off or leave it on, Google notes that all conversations with Gemini are saved for 72 hours to “provide the service and process any <strong>feedback</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Meta AI</strong></p>
<p>Meta has an AI chatbot used across its social media services Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. The company says its AI models are trained on information shared by users including social media posts and photos. Meta says it does not train its AI systems on private messages sent by users to friends or family.</p>
<p>Not everyone can opt out of this policy. People in the 27-nation European Union and Britain – both of which have strong privacy rules – can.

            <title>What Is Ketamine? (2024/8/22)</title>

<p>An investigation into the death of American actor Matthew Perry has led to criminal charges against five people. Perry, a star of the popular television series <em>Friends</em>, died suddenly in October. He was 54. Doctors who examined his body after death said Perry died from an <strong>overdose</strong> of the powerful drug ketamine.</p>
<p><strong>So what is ketamine?</strong></p>
<p>Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic. The drug is often used to put people into a deep sleep for medical operations, also called surgery. The treatment is called general anesthesia. A doctor can inject the drug into a muscle or through a liquid flow directly into a patient's veins.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Matthew Perry poses for a portrait on Feb. 17, 2015, in New York.

<p>The drug's chemistry is similar to the recreational drug called PCP. Some people use ketamine recreationally for its <strong>euphoric</strong> effects. It can cause <strong>hallucinations</strong> and can affect breathing and the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Ketamine becomes popular</strong></p>
<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ketamine for use only for general anesthesia. However, American doctors are free to <strong>prescribe</strong> drugs for treatments other than those approved by the FDA. This is known as off-label use.</p>
<p>Ketamine use has seen a huge, fast rise in recent years as a treatment for pain and mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Perry was using it to treat depression. His usual doctors were treating him with what is called ketamine infusion therapy. However, investigators say the actor turned to other sources when his doctors refused to give him as much as he wanted.</p>
<p>Last week, government lawyers said Perry got ketamine illegally through a group that included two doctors, Perry's assistant and a woman they identified as the “Ketamine Queen.” Perry's assistant injected the actor with ketamine — including several times on the day Perry died.</p>
<p><strong>How else is ketamine being used?</strong></p>
<p>Emergency medical workers also sometimes use ketamine to <strong>sedate</strong> people who appear to be out of control, aggressive or a threat to themselves or others. Some states and agencies around the country have begun to reconsider this use of ketamine because of the drug's health risks.</p>
<p>In 2019, an American court found two emergency medical workers guilty in the overdose killing of a teenager in Colorado. The medical team injected the man with a deadly amount of ketamine during a police operation.</p>
<p>An Associated Press investigation found that, generally, use of ketamine and similar drugs as a policing or security tool has spread quietly across the nation over the last 15 years.</p>

<p>Mongolia, with its beautiful land and open spaces, is hoping to get more foreign visitors.</p>
<p>Like most countries, Mongolia's <strong>tourism</strong> industry was hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It has launched a “Welcome to MonGOlia” campaign to gain more visitors. The government has added flights and simplified the visa process, offering visa-free visits for many countries.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Tourists take photos near the 40-meter-tall stainless steel statue of Genghis Khan, a national hero who amassed power to become the leader of the Mongols in the early 13th century on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on July 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/da66ae98-df97-420e-ac26-01cbf21a5f4e_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Tourists take photos near the 40-meter-tall stainless steel statue of Genghis Khan, a national hero who amassed power to become the leader of the Mongols in the early 13th century on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on July 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)</span></div>
<p>At least 437,000 foreign visitors came in the first seven months of this year, up 25 percent over the same period last year.</p>
<p>That total includes increasing numbers from Europe, the United States and Japan. Visitors from South Korea nearly doubled, thanks in part to the fact that the flight between the countries is under four hours.</p>
<p>However, Mongolia's government is still short of its goal of 1 million visitors per year from 2023-2025.</p>
<p>The country has a population of 3.3 million people. About half of them live in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. As a result, there is plenty of open space for <strong>adventure</strong> <strong>tourists</strong> to explore, said Egjimaa Battsooj, who works for a tour company.</p>
<p>The company offers adventures including <strong>horseback</strong> trips and camping trips with the possibility of staying in gers, the traditional homes still used by Mongolia's herders.</p>
<p>There is little chance of running across private property, so few places are off-limits, she said.</p>
<p>“You don't need to open a gate, you don't need to have permission from anyone,” Battsooj said, sitting in front of a map of Mongolia.</p>
<p>“We are kind of like the last truly <strong>nomad </strong>culture on the whole planet,” she added.</p>
<p>Lonely Planet, a travel guide publisher, named Mongolia its top destination in its Best in Travel 2024 report. The pope's visit to Mongolia last year also helped bring attention to the country.</p>
<p>Its <strong>breakdancers </strong>became stars at last year's Asian Games. And some local bands have developed a global following, like The Hu, a band that mixes traditional Mongolian instruments and throat singing with modern rock.</p>
<p>Most people know little about Mongolia. American tourist Michael John said he knew some of the history about Genghis Khan. He had also seen a documentary on eagles used by hunters before deciding to stop in Ulaanbaatar as part of a longer vacation.</p>
<p>“It was a great opportunity to learn more,” the 40-year-old said.</p>
<p>Tourism represented 7.2 percent of Mongolia's <strong>gross domestic product</strong> and 7.6 percent of its employment in 2019 before the industry collapsed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank says. But the organization noted chances for “<strong>substantial </strong>growth” for Mongolia, with “diverse nature and <strong>stunning sceneries</strong>” and sports and adventure tourism possibilities.</p>
<p>Mongolia tourism advertisements bring attention to all of those interests. The ads show beautiful frozen lakes in winter, the Northern Lights and events like reindeer sledding and riding, camel racing, and hiking.</p>
<p>Munkhjargal Dayan offers rides on camels, traditional archery and the opportunity to have eagles trained for hunting stand on a visitor's arm.</p>
<p>“We want to show tourists coming from other countries that we have such a way of life in Mongolia,” he said, waiting for tourists by a big statue of Genghis Kahn on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>Outside the lively capital, getting around can be difficult in summer as the land becomes wet. There are limited roads and buildings, a shortage of places to stay, and a lack of skilled labor in some areas.</p>
<p>It is also easy for foreigners to get lost, with few signs in English, said Dutch tourist Jasper Koning. Nevertheless, he said he was thoroughly enjoying his trip.</p>
<p>“The weather is super, the scenery is more than super, it's clean, the people are friendly,” he said.</p>

            <title>UN: Violence Is Harming Haiti’s Schools (2024/8/21)</title>

<p>Schools in Haiti are operating without enough chairs, blackboards, and even <strong>bathrooms</strong>.</p>
<p>Violent criminal groups limit basic government services and deepen poverty while the state education system faces a $23 million deficit.</p>
<p>Yasmine Sherif is the executive director of the U.N. organization Education Cannot Wait. “The country needs help,” Sherif said during her three-day visit to the Caribbean country in July.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Students attend a math class at the Jean Marie Vincent High School in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Thursday, July 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-e7e8-08dcb8a3d59d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Students attend a math class at the Jean Marie Vincent High School in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Thursday, July 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Odelyn Joseph)</span></div>
<p>Sherif said the organization provided $2.5 million to help nearly 75,000 children in Haiti with money, food and other programs. And she asked the European Union and other countries, including France and the U.S., to help close the educational deficit.</p>
<p>"My main concern is security," she said, noting the effect that violence has had on education.</p>
<p>Criminal groups, called <strong>gangs</strong>, killed or injured more than 2,500 people in the first three months of the year. Violence has seriously affected life in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>At least 919 schools remain closed in Port-au-Prince and in the central area of Artibonite because of gang violence. The U.N. says that school closures have affected more than 150,000 students.</p>
<p>"Education is part of the solution," Sherif said. "That would end extreme poverty, extreme violence and create political stability and create a reliable workforce."</p>
<p><strong>Gang violence impacts</strong></p>
<p>Gang violence also has left some 580,000 people homeless across Haiti, with many crowding into temporary shelters or taking over schools, causing them to close. Schools that remain open are increasingly forced to take students from others that have closed.</p>
<p>The Jean Marie Vincent School in central Port-au-Prince, for example, has accepted students from 12 other schools.</p>
<p>Charles Luckerno is the head of the Vincent School. He said, "We're not the only ones" facing such serious problems. Luckerno said that when classes end for the day, people left homeless by gang violence enter the school and sleep on its ground.</p>
<p>Although that creates health problems, Luckerno still lets them stay. He said, "We are human. We cannot throw them out."</p>
<p><strong>Not enough chairs</strong></p>
<p>Williamson Bissainthe is a 22-year-old high school student who is preparing to take his final exam to <strong>graduate</strong>. He described the sad state of some schools.</p>
<p>"A lot of schools are missing benches or chairs. Teachers do not show up on time. The hardest part of this is that there are no bathrooms," he said.</p>
<p>Bissainthe added, "I hope that the generation that comes after me doesn't have to go through the same suffering.”</p>
<p>Private schools are out of reach for many in Haiti, a country of more than 11 million people. More than 60 percent of the population earns less than $2 a day.</p>
<p><strong>Homeless students</strong></p>
<p>Among those who have been forced to flee their homes is 20-year-old Megane Dumorcy. She would like to study agriculture, but completing her education has been difficult.</p>
<p>"The insecurity has had a huge <strong>impact</strong> on my life," she said, noting that some students have been forced to leave their backpacks behind as they flee gangs. "The state should find a solution for that. We shouldn't be living in a country where our movement is limited."</p>
<p>She said her school is only half-built and lacks a library, a computer room, a blackboard and chairs. She does research on her phone when needed.</p>
<p>Another blow to Haitian schools came in late 2022. That was the time the U.S. started a program permitting Haitians and people from other countries to enter the country on humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p>"A lot of teachers left," said Frantz Erine, an official at the Jean Marie Vincent School.</p>

            <title>Zimbabwean Officials Train Children to Coexist with Dangerous Wildlife (2024/8/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By </span><br/><span class="datetime">20 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>In Zimbabwe, increased wildlife activity near people has put children in rural areas at greater risk of animal attacks while walking to school.</p>
<p>Officials and some parents hope a campaign to teach children how to identify danger could reduce risks.</p>
<p>No deaths have been reported, but student Esther Bote and her friends remain careful.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Esther Bote, 14, walks to school with her friends in a bushy area on the periphery of the Save Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe, Tuesday, July 9, 2024. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-9fc7-08dcc06be248_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Esther Bote, 14, walks to school with her friends in a bushy area on the periphery of the Save Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe, Tuesday, July 9, 2024. </span></div>
<p>“We usually walk in groups to feel safer,” said the fourteen-year-old. The five-kilometer walk to school includes travel through thick forest.</p>
<p>Savé Valley Conservancy, a private group, and Zimbabwe's parks agency run the program for school-age children. It teaches them how to recognize danger signs and how to coexist with wildlife.</p>
<p>Many students, like Esther, are now able to identify the footprints of animals and the sounds they make. They also know how to read the direction of the wind and when and where to seek shelter.</p>
<p>Dingani Masuku of Savé Valley Conservancy said wildlife affects children more than other people. He said children walk to school and often do household jobs like getting water and firewood. Such activity means they are outside often.</p>
<p>Masaku said, “That's why we are targeting schools so that they can know how animals behave, what to do with the animals.”</p>
<p>He added that the campaign is trying to teach children “a sense of ownership,” so they “don't see the animal as an <strong>adversary</strong>, but they see it as something <strong>beneficial</strong> to the community, something which should be respected.”</p>
<p><strong>Education efforts </strong></p>
<p>Recently at Chiyambiro Secondary School, a young woman was teaching children about the dangers of wild animals. The 18-year-old recently left school to become part of a group of young woman <strong>rangers</strong>.</p>
<p>“Don't <strong>approach</strong> an animal. If it's a lion, it's looking for food. That's why it's in the community. It is looking for <strong>cheap</strong>, easy <strong>prey</strong>, and you could be the easy prey.”</p>
<p>Some of the children said they travel up to 15 kilometers to get to school. They said they have to start walking to school before the sun rises when animals such as hyenas are still awake and active.</p>
<p>An official from the national parks agency spoke to the children about why wildlife is important to the community. He said wildlife supports the country's <strong>tourism</strong> industry and leads to job creation, such as the new ranger positions.</p>
<p>Alphonce Chimangaisu is the chair of the school development committee at the Chiyambiro Secondary School. He said parents hope the information campaign will make children safer.</p>
<p>“Some parents have stopped their children from going to school because they don't know what might happen,” he said.</p>
<p>School officials in affected rural areas often must delay the start of the day's classes and end them early. The president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, Obert Masaraure, said school officials are trying to let children walk to and from school during daylight hours. That is when wild animals are less likely to be around.</p>
<p>“We have reports of learners who have completely withdrawn from school fearing for their lives,” Masaraure said. He also noted that teachers who live far from schools are increasingly missing work. He said all these problems are making it more difficult for rural learners to get a “quality education.”</p>
<p>Tinashe Farawo is a Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority official. He said wild animals are going into communities for food and water because of dry weather conditions, also called drought. The official said the parks agency is pushing for animal behavior and conservation training at schools around the country.</p>
<p>Farawo also said children teach their parents what they have learned. He said the agency has established environmental clubs at many schools to bring attention to the issue.</p>
<p>The official noted that conflicts had gotten worse because of<strong> </strong>drought. He said the parks agency had received between 3,000 and 4,000 emergency calls from communities battling wildlife in three years. In 2018, there were only 900 calls.</p>

            <title>US Reporter Used AI to Create False Quotes for Stories (2024/8/20)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">19 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>An American newspaper reporter has resigned from his job after it was discovered that he used an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to create false <strong>quotes</strong> for stories.</p>
<p>Aaron Pelczar worked for the <em>Cody Enterprise</em>, a newspaper based in the town of Cody, Wyoming. A reporter from a competing newspaper became suspicious about Pelczar's stories and asked to meet with him. Pelczar admitted to using AI to create parts of stories. He later quit his position with the <em>Enterprise</em>.</p>
<p>The reporter who discovered the AI-assisted stories was CJ Baker. He works for the <em>Powell Tribune</em>, a newspaper in the neighboring town of Powell.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A recent issue of the Cody Enterprise, the Wyoming newspaper where a reporter used artificial intelligence to help write his stories, is seen Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2024, at the Wyoming State Library in Cheyenne. (AP Photo/Mead Gruver)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-5264-08dcbe373062_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A recent issue of the Cody Enterprise, the Wyoming newspaper where a reporter used artificial intelligence to help write his stories, is seen Tuesday, Aug. 13, 2024, at the Wyoming State Library in Cheyenne. (AP Photo/Mead Gruver)</span></div>
<p>Baker told The Associated Press he discovered several writing examples that made him suspicious about Pelczar's work. He said some of the writing sounded unnatural or robotic. But one part of a story stood out as possibly being false. It was contained in a June 26 <strong>article</strong> about comedian Larry the Cable Guy being chosen to lead a local parade.</p>
<p>The story ended with a very unusual line that had nothing to do with the story's subject. Rather, it seemed to provide an explanation of the method it used to build the story. The line read, “This structure ensures that the most critical information is presented first, making it easier for readers to <strong>grasp</strong> the main points quickly.”</p>
<p>Baker, who has been a reporter for more than 15 years, said after reading the story he decided to do additional research on other pieces written by Pelczar. He later decided to set up a meeting with Pelczar to discuss his concerns. He was able to meet with Pelczar and the <strong>editor</strong> of the <em>Enterprise</em>, Chris Bacon.</p>
<p>Baker wrote an article in his own newspaper about his findings. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.powelltribune.com/stories/after-getting-caught-fabricating-quotes-cody-reporter-resigns,135514">described</a> his meeting with Pelczar and Bacon as uncomfortable, but friendly. Baker wrote that when asked about suspicions surrounding his work, Pelczar answered, “<strong>Obviously</strong> I've never <strong>intentionally</strong> tried to misquote anybody.”</p>
<p>When asked whether any of the disputed statements in his writings had been by created by an AI tool, Pelczar said, “That could be the case.” Baker said Pelczar then added, “But again, if there are issues I will correct them and issue apologies and say they are misstatements.”</p>
<p>After closely examining Pelczar's articles, Bacon and the publisher of the <em>Enterprise</em> discovered the use of AI and apologized for his actions. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.codyenterprise.com/news/opinion/article_be57a9e0-58de-11ef-96eb-abf87276a1da.html">In an <strong>editorial</strong></a> published recently, <em>Enterprise</em> Editor Chris Bacon admitted he had “failed to catch” the AI-written copy and false quotes. He added that the mistake had permitted AI “to put words that were never spoken into stories.”</p>
<p>Bacon said the <em>Enterprise</em> discovered at least seven stories that included AI-created quotes. Two of the questioned stories included false quotes from Wyoming <strong>Governor</strong> Mark Gordon.</p>
<p>Bacon said some of the quotes appeared “very believable.” He noted that the people he spoke with during his investigation said the quotes sounded like something they might have said. But they never personally spoke to Pelczar.</p>
<p>Other reporters have had their careers hurt or ended for making up facts or quotes in articles. There are also others who have been accused of <strong>plagiarism</strong>, which involves a reporter publishing the writings of others without giving those reporters credit for the material.</p>
<p>But media experts say the recent incident involving Pelczar demonstrates the possible dangers that exist when reporters and editors depend on AI tools in the news production process.</p>
<p>Megan Barton is publisher of the <em>Cody Enterprise. </em>She wrote an editorial that described AI as “the new, <strong>advanced</strong> form of plagiarism and in the field of media and writing.”</p>
<p>Barton<strong> </strong>noted the newspaper now has a system in place to recognize AI-generated stories and will “have longer <strong>conversations</strong> about how AI-generated stories are not acceptable.”</p>

<p>The World Health Organization is calling for donations to fight the latest outbreak of the viral disease mpox in Africa.</p>
<p>The U.N. health agency declared mpox in Africa a "public health emergency of international concern" last week.</p>
<p>The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made the announcement after a meeting of the WHO's emergency committee. The move follows a declaration by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). That organization declared mpox a public health emergency in Africa one day earlier.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Christian Musema, a laboratory nurse, takes a sample from a child declared a suspected case of Mpox at the treatment center in Munigi, Democratic Republic of Congo on July 19, 2024.

<p>The WHO said there have been more than 14,000 cases and more than 524 deaths in Africa this year. So far, about 96 percent of all cases and deaths have taken place in one country: the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But the WHO and others are concerned that a new version of the viral disease could spread more easily among people.</p>
<p>The Associated Press recently reported some of the information known about the current mpox outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>What is mpox?</strong></p>
<p>Mpox is also known as m<i><i>onkey</i></i>pox. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/index.html">says</a> the viral disease was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a “pox-like” disease appeared in m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s. Until recently, most human cases involved people in central and West Africa who had contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>In 2022, experts confirmed that the virus could be spread through sex. Outbreaks were reported in more than 70 countries that had not reported the disease before.</p>
<p>Mpox belongs to the same virus family as smallpox. It causes symptoms like high body temperature, <strong>chills</strong> and body pain. People with serious cases can develop <strong>lesions</strong> on the face, hands, chest and sex organs.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening in Africa?</strong></p>
<p>The number of cases has increased sharply in the last few weeks. The Africa CDC said the disease has been identified in at least 13 African countries. Compared to the same period last year, the agency said cases have increased by 160 percent and deaths by 19 percent.</p>
<p>The version of mpox seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could kill up to 10 percent of people infected. Unlike earlier mpox outbreaks, where lesions were mostly seen on the chest, hands and feet, the new form of mpox causes less severe <strong>symptoms</strong>. This could make the disease harder to identify.</p>
<p>The WHO said mpox was recently reported for the first time in four East African countries: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. All of those cases were linked to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the Ivory Coast and South Africa, health officials have reported a less dangerous version of mpox than the one that spread in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>The WHO's declaration</strong></p>
<p>The WHO's emergency declaration is meant to get donors to provide money for a campaign against the disease.</p>
<p>African CDC Director General Dr. Jean Kaseya said the agency's declaration of a public emergency was meant “to <strong>mobilize</strong> our <strong>institutions</strong>, our collective will and our resources.”</p>
<p>Michael Marks teaches medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said, “It is clear that current control <strong>strategies</strong> aren't working and there is a clear need for more resources.”</p>
<p><strong>What is different from 2022?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the cases during the 2022 outbreak of the viral disease were gay and bisexual men. The virus was spread through close contact and sex.</p>
<p>Although similar things are happening in Africa, children under the age of 15 now make up more than 70 percent of mpox cases and 85 percent of deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>WHO chief Tedros said officials are dealing with several outbreaks and, what he called, “different <strong>modes</strong> of <strong>transmission</strong> and different levels of risk.”</p>
<p>Greg Ramm is with the aid group Save the Children. He said his organization is worried about mpox spreading in crowded refugee camps. He said there were 345,000 children living in unhealthy conditions in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ramm added that the country's health system is already “collapsing” because of malnutrition, measles and cholera.</p>
<p>Dr. Boghuma Titanji is an infectious disease expert at Emory University in the American state of Georgia. She said it is unclear why the disease is mostly affecting children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She said children might become infected more easily or social conditions like overcrowding or infected parents might explain the problem.</p>
<p><strong>How might mpox be stopped</strong></p>
<p>The AP says in 2022, developed countries stopped the outbreak of mpox with treatments and vaccines. But few vaccines are available in Africa.</p>
<p>Marks said the immunization would likely help — including vaccination against the similar smallpox virus. He said, “We need a large supply of vaccine so that we can vaccinate populations most at risk.” He said that would mean vaccinating children, sex workers and adults in affected areas.</p>
<p>The WHO has already released $1.45 million of emergency money for mpox. But the U.N. agency says $15 million is needed to start efforts to combat the disease.</p>

            <title>US Plans to Limit Water Usage from Colorado River (2024/8/20)</title>

<p>The U.S. government plans to reduce the amount of Colorado River water several states are permitted to use next year.</p>
<p>The river supplies water to seven Western states, more than 20 Native American tribes, and two states in Mexico.</p>
<p>Those states and the country of Mexico are also considering plans for how to share the water after 2026. That is when many current rules and agreements about the use of Colorado River water will come to an end.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Colorado River flows at Horseshoe Bend in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, in Page, Arizona, June 8, 2022.

<p>The river brings water to millions of hectares of farmland in the American West. Hydroelectric dams on the river produce power. Experts say increased water use, combined with rising temperatures and dry weather, are the reasons for the need to make cuts.</p>
<p>In 2007, following years of dry weather, the U.S. states in the river's <strong>basin </strong>and the federal government agreed to rules to help deal with lower water levels. The states involved were Arizona, Nevada, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Those rules <strong>determine</strong> when some of the states must cut their water usage based on levels at Lake Mead. The lake is on the border of Nevada and Arizona. It provides water for hydropower, farming, and other needs.</p>
<p>Because of the need for new rules, states, Native American tribes, and others are forming new plans to deal with even deeper water cuts that might happen in 2026.</p>
<p>The federal government will announce water cuts for 2025 based on levels at Lake Mead. If Lake Mead drops below a level that has been agreed to, Arizona, California, Nevada and Mexico will face cuts. However, California might not face cuts because the current rules give that state special water rights.</p>
<p>Last year, Arizona, California and Nevada agreed to save an extra 3 million <strong>acre-feet</strong> of water in addition to the cuts the federal government had already required. An “acre-foot” is equal to about 1.2 million liters. In return, the U.S. government agreed to pay water <strong>districts</strong> and other users for much of that reduction in water use.</p>
<p>Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming are in the river's Upper Basin. Those states have not used all of the water the rules permit them to use. For this reason, they have not yet had to reduce the amount of water they take from the river.</p>
<p>Wet weather in 2023 and efforts to save water by Lower Basin states have increased the level of Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Lake Powell in Utah is another body of water that holds and releases water from the river.</p>
<p>However, experts say higher temperatures will continue to reduce water in the Colorado River in the coming years.</p>
<p>In March, Upper and Lower Basin states, tribes and environmental groups proposed plans to deal with likely water reductions in the future.</p>
<p>Arizona, California and Nevada asked the federal government to include water levels at other <strong>reservoirs</strong> besides Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Their plan says that if the whole system drops below 38 percent of the maximum amount of water it can hold, the Upper Basin and Mexico should share deeper cuts equally with the Lower Basin.</p>
<p>Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming want larger and sooner cuts when water is low at Lake Mead and Lake Powell. The cuts would affect California, Arizona and Nevada. Their plan does not call for reductions in how much water Upper Basin states use.</p>
<p>The federal government is expected to propose new rules by December. The rules would consider the different plans and possible steps for the future. Until then, states, tribes and other groups will continue negotiations on water.</p>

            <title>New Study Suggests Mars Has Large Underground Ocean (2024/8/19)</title>

<p>A new study provides evidence that Mars contains a large ocean deep beneath its surface.</p>
<p>The finding is based on data collected by the InSight Lander, a robotic explorer operated by the American space agency NASA. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/insight/">InSight</a>, which landed in 2018, was designed to capture data from within the planet's <strong>interior</strong>. The lander ended its operations on Mars in late 2022.</p>
<p>For the current study, researchers used <strong>seismic</strong> data collected by InSight. The team examined the data to study Martian quake activity. Seismic activity on Mars happens in the form of “<a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/study-suggests-new-cause-for-strongest-marsquake-ever/7328807.html">marsquakes</a>.” NASA says InSight had recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This file image provided by NASA shows the InSight Mars lander in a selfie photo composite on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. (NASA/JPL-Caltech via AP, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-2db0-08dcbd7d6964_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This file image provided by NASA shows the InSight Mars lander in a selfie photo composite on April 24, 2022, the 1,211th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. (NASA/JPL-Caltech via AP, File)</span></div>
<p>The device InSight uses to measure ground movements is called a seismometer. NASA specially designed the lander and its instruments to be extremely sensitive for the Martian environment. The seismic data suggests liquid water exists deep beneath the ground where InSight operated from.</p>
<p>Since water is considered necessary to support life, scientists say the presence of it on Mars leaves open the possibility that some form of life might exist, or existed there in the past.</p>
<p>Numerous past studies have also provided evidence that liquid water could exist on Mars. Scientists have already uncovered evidence that about 3 billion years ago, the surface of Mars likely had an active system of lakes, rivers and oceans</p>
<p>Mars is believed to have lost its surface water as its atmosphere thinned. This likely turned the planet into the dry, dusty world it is today. Scientists have theorized that much of the ancient water escaped out into space or remained buried under the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Water below Martian crust</strong></p>
<p>Vashan Wright is an assistant professor of Geophysics at the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He helped lead the research. Wright told The Associated Press the data suggests liquid water sits between 11 to 20 kilometers down in the Martian <strong>crust</strong>. He added that the water likely moved down from the surface billions of years ago when water is believed to have flowed freely on Mars.</p>
<p>The researchers combined computer models with the seismic data collected by InSight to reach their findings. They said the data showed the water is likely contained in a deep<strong> layer</strong> of igneous rock beneath the Martian surface. Igneous rock is formed from magma, a very hot liquid rock that has cooled.</p>
<p>Wright and his team recently reported their results <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409983121">in a study</a> published in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>
<p>In a statement to Reuters news agency, Wright said, "On Earth what we know is where it is wet enough and there are enough sources of energy, there is microbial life very deep in Earth's subsurface." He added that the data suggests "the <strong>ingredients</strong> for life as we know it” may exist in the Martian subsurface.</p>
<p>The researchers said the InSight lander operated around the planet's Elysium Planitia area, near the equator. They believe the area is representative of the rest of Mars. The study suggests enough water exists below the surface to form a planet-wide ocean about 1 to 2 kilometers deep.</p>
<p><strong>Better understanding of Martian water cycles</strong></p>
<p>There is currently no way to confirm the study's suggested existence of liquid water because it sits so far beneath the Martian surface. Such a confirmation would require large <strong>drills</strong> and other specialized equipment.</p>
<p>But Wright <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/12/scientists-find-oceans-of-water-on-mars-its-just-too-deep-to-tap/">said</a> in a statement that for now, researchers can use the newly examined data to gain a better understanding of Martian water <strong>cycles</strong>. This can help scientists improve their knowledge about the planet's climate as well as the development of the Martian surface and interior. Wright noted the latest findings could also help guide researchers in where to look for further evidence of possible life forms on Mars.</p>
<p>"I'm <strong>inspired</strong> and I hope the public is also inspired," Wright said about the study results. "Humans can work together to put instruments on a planet... and try to understand what's going on there."</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>After 13 years of marriage, Bethany Meola admits that she and her husband can get caught up in their busy lives. They are raising three children and they both have careers.</p>
<p>So, they make sure to take time every day for a six-second kiss.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - US WWII veteran Harold Terens, 100, left, and Jeanne Swerlin, 96, kiss from a window after celebrating their wedding at the town hall of Carentan-les-Marais, in Normandy, France, June 8, 2024.

<p>The six-second kiss is a daily exercise suggested by <strong>couples therapists </strong>John and Julie Gottman. It is as simple as it sounds. They say taking time each day for a six-second kiss can help connect you physically and emotionally with your partner.</p>
<p>“It's kind of a funny thing to put on the to-do list,” Meola said. She first learned of the exercise while studying for a master's degree that centered on marriage and family.</p>
<p>It made a difference, Meola said. “It's long enough to kind of ground you and say, ‘Here's this other person that I love, that I've <strong>committed</strong> to.'”</p>
<p><strong>Why does six seconds matter?</strong></p>
<p>Married in 1987, Julie and John Gottman co-founded the Gottman Institute to teach couples therapy. John Gottman also wrote <em>The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work</em> and other books.</p>
<p>John Gottman told the Associated Press that six seconds is not just a number. It comes from studying more than 3,000 couples over 30 years. The Gottmans found that a six-second kiss is enough to help release oxytocin.</p>
<p>Oxytocin is a natural substance that is produced by the body. The substance is widely believed to help a mother connect with her newborn baby. The Gottmans say it also builds trust in a relationship by calming down the fear center of the brain. They also used research by neuro-economist Paul Zak. Zak suggests that a 20-second hug creates the same results.</p>
<p>“For the 20-second hug or the six-second kiss, it's one that really feels different. It feels like you've come home,” John Gottman said.</p>
<p>Julie Gottman said a long kiss works best for couples who are committed to each other and who trust each other. Couples who are working through personal or marital issues might not be ready for it.</p>
<p><strong>How to start</strong></p>
<p>But how do you start this type of exercise? Couples have to decide to take time out of their day to put their relationship first. One partner might open the discussion by saying they believe the exercise could bring them closer and it is worth a try.</p>
<p>The experts suggest creating a <strong>ritual</strong>. For example, set aside the same time every day when both are about to leave for work or just before bedtime.</p>
<p>Creating a ritual prevents a relationship from becoming one in which the only thing a couple does together is add things "to their very long list of <strong>tasks</strong>,” John Gottman said. “We want to really <strong>nurture</strong> the <strong>romance.”</strong></p>
<p>Rituals also create a shared sense of purpose, Julie Gottman said. However, she reminds people to enjoy<strong> </strong>it. Do not think of it as something you are supposed to do.</p>
<p>And to the couples who say they cannot find the time? She is direct and honest.</p>
<p>“You really don't have six seconds?” “You know, we're not talking six hours here. We're talking six seconds," she said with a laugh.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On today's show we talk about some expressions that deal with an important device in our lives – our phones.</p>
<p>With a smartphone, we can connect to the world. In fact, we can say smartphones <u>give us the world at our fingertips</u>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - U.S. actress Lindsay Lohan speaks on a telephone during a charity day at BGC Partners in the Canary Wharf business district in London, Britain September 12, 2016.

<p>Needless to say, we use phones to stay in contact with the people in our lives. We use them to reach out to our friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers.</p>
<p>So, when we tell someone that we are <u>just a phone call away</u>, what we are really telling them is that we are available. We are there for them. We often use this expression to offer help to someone who is in a difficult situation or just in need of a friendly voice.</p>
<p>For example, let's say my friend is having a hard time with an advanced English course. The assignments are difficult, the material is hard to understand, and his teacher has not been answering his emails. I can say to him, “Look, if you ever need help, <u>I'm just a phone call away</u>. Call anytime!”</p>
<p>It's good to be available to some people some of the time.</p>
<p>But maybe not all the time.</p>
<p>We all have someone in our lives who contacts us too much. They may<u> blow up our phones</u> with a flood of calls and text messages. When <u>your phone blows up</u>, someone is trying to contact you repeatedly.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Let's say your neighbor, Jana, is having trouble with another neighbor, Jake. And you are in the middle of it. They are both <u>blowing up your phone</u> with calls and texts about their disagreement. You can tell them, “<u>Hold the phone</u>! Just stop! Talk to each other and work out your problems because I've had enough.”</p>
<p>The expression <u>hold the phone</u> is a way to say “wait” or “stop.” We use it when we hear something surprising or when we have had enough of a situation.</p>
<p>And it doesn't have to be about phone calls or texts. For example, let's say a friend tells me that my favorite singer is coming to town. I can't believe it! So, I can say, “<u>Hold the phone</u>! Are you serious?” It's like saying, "Hold on a minute!"</p>
<p>Now, let's go back to your arguing neighbors, Jana and Jake. Let's say they take your advice. They are willing to work out their problems. They try to call each other but the keep missing each other's calls. First Jana calls Jake, but he isn't available. Then Jake calls her back, but now Jana isn't available. They play <u>phone tag</u> like this for days until they finally speak to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Tag</strong> is a child's game. One person is “it” and must chase and tag, or touch, the other children. So, <u>phone tag</u> is when two people try to contact each other but their calls go unanswered.</p>
<p>At least Jake and Jana are trying to work out their problems. When it comes to keeping relationships happy in the neighborhood, they are not <u>phoning it in</u>.</p>
<p>When we <u>phone it in</u>, we don't try our best at something. We don't give our best efforts. For example, some people who lose interest in their jobs might start <u>phoning it in</u>. They stop trying and do not do their best work.</p>
<p>That's not the case with us here at VOA Learning English. we are not <u>phoning it in</u>. We work hard every day to bring you new learning English content.</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Small Farm Animals Are Growing in Popularity (2024/8/17)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">16 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Americans are showing more interest in owning unusually small cows, goats, d<i><i>onkey</i></i>s and other small farm animals.</p>
<p>These animals are <strong>cute</strong>. They require less food and space. And they might even help cut the grass.</p>
<p>People who farm for fun are known as <strong>hobby</strong> farmers. They are looking for easy-to-raise farm animals. Some just like the idea of having a little pig or a small sheep as a pet.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Jamie Campion pets her one of her Southdown Babydoll sheep as it grazes in the backyard Wednesday morning, July 3, 2024. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-36fa-08dcbbc8accc_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Jamie Campion pets her one of her Southdown Babydoll sheep as it grazes in the backyard Wednesday morning, July 3, 2024.

<p>The word for something that is unusually small is <strong>miniature</strong>.</p>
<p>Animal <strong>breeders</strong> say sales of these little farm animals have grown since the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, more people started raising chickens at home for fun and fresh eggs. Like chickens, <strong>mini</strong> farm animals appeal to beginners who want to try a rural lifestyle.</p>
<p>Brian Gazda has a small farm in the western state of Idaho. He runs a YouTube channel called "Hobby Farm Guys" with two friends. Gazda said a lot of people do not have a large piece of land, but if they have a small area, “they can keep a miniature cow or a few miniature goats."</p>
<p>Martin Fysh works for Tractor Supply Company. He said social media has brought attention to mini farm animals. But Fysh thinks their popularity also shows a natural path among <strong>customers</strong> who started out by raising a few chickens.</p>
<p>"They're seen as part of the extended family," Fysh said.</p>
<p>Some owners of mini farm animals turn their hobbies into money-making activities. They show the animals to visitors, breed animals, and write about their farming experiences.</p>
<p>But newcomers to these activities need to weigh the pros and cons, or the good and bad effects, of hobby farming, Gazda and other hobby farmers said. Among the problems is the rising cost of miniature farm animals. While they are cute, they can also be aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>Mini goats</strong></p>
<p>Brittany Snow is a high school English teacher in Florida who owns several small-sized Nigerian dwarf goats. She dreamed of living on a farm. Her family recently moved to a rural area.</p>
<p>Thirty-two-year-old Snow started with four Nigerian Dwarf goats. Snow expected them to produce milk right away, but she learned that is not the case.</p>
<p>Angelia Alden is a business operations manager for the Miniature Dairy Goat Association. She said many people who buy mini goats sell them after a few years because their care presents problems and costs they did not expect. Rising animal feed costs can be one problem, as is finding farm animal medical care.</p>
<p><strong>Mini cows and d<i><i>onkey</i></i>s</strong></p>
<p>The mini farm animals can also be heavy. Some of the popular miniature animals on social media are cows that can weigh between 220 and 270 kilograms.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight-year-old Allie Sine started her own business breeding and selling mini cows in 2020. Social media videos showing some of her mini cows have gotten millions of views. Last year, she sold about 190 young cows. Each animal sold for between $2,000 and $30,000. "Everything just <strong>skyrocketed</strong>," Sine said.</p>
<p><strong>Mini d<i><i>onkey</i></i>s</strong></p>
<p>Kim Furches owns a farm with her husband, Ken, in West Jefferson, North Carolina. She has found similar success. Furches said they bred mini d<i><i>onkey</i></i>s for about 20 years. Before the pandemic, they would usually sell about eight d<i><i>onkey</i></i>s per year for less than a thousand dollars each. They now sell about 20 per year. The last mini d<i><i>onkey</i></i> sold for $7,500, Furches said.</p>
<p><strong>Sheep follow her around</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jamie Campion, who is 41, and her husband, Jeff, bought two Southdown Babydoll sheep from a local breeder near their home in Thompson's Station, Tennessee. The animals cost $800 each.</p>
<p>Jamie Campion said the sheep have become good at keeping their grass short. But more often, the sheep give her joy as would other pets. Once she took them for a walk in the snow. "They just followed right behind," she said. "There's a whole sheep and <strong>shepherd</strong> relationship.”</p>

            <title>Combine and Integrate (2024/8/17)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Simona in China about the words "combine" and "integrate."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-30f2-08dcbc7c9511_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>Hi! I have a question. What is the difference between "combine" and "integrate?" Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Simona. I'm happy to answer this question.</p>
<p>"Combine" and "integrate" are similar in meaning. But, there are some small differences in usage.</p>
<p>The word "combine" is in our Learning English <em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://docs.voanews.eu/en-US-LEARN/2022/06/07/c4dbd6af-5f63-4f28-bc42-0bd175f4e4b4.pdf">Word Book</a></em>. We define it as a verb meaning to mix or bring together.</p>
<p>"Integrate" is not in our <em>Word Book</em>. <em>Merriam-Webster</em>'s dictionary says the word means to unite or form into a whole.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the prefixes that begin each word. "Combine" begins with the prefix <em>co-</em>, such as in the word "copilot." This prefix means "with."</p>
<p>"Integrate" begins with the prefix <em>inter-</em> but with the letter "r" removed. This means "among" or "between," as in the word "international."</p>
<p>The prefix <em>co-</em> generally gives the sense of joining two or more things together. For example, oxygen combines with hydrogen to make water.<strong> </strong>However, "combine" can also mean to mix things together, such as mixing the <strong>ingredients</strong> in a <strong>recipe</strong>.</p>
<p>"Integrate" can be used that same way. But, it also can mean to add something to one or more other things and mix them so well that they fully unite.</p>
<p>For example, a school might try to integrate healthy foods into its school meals. Or, a jazz group might try to integrate elements of country music into their songs.</p>
<p>Notice that we use the preposition "into" with the word integrate. We say that we "integrate <em>x into y." </em>Here is another example:</p>
<p><em>New technologies can quickly become <u>integrated into our lives</u>. </em></p>
<p>But when we use "combine," we use the preposition "with." We say we "combine <em>x with y," </em>or "combine <em>x and y," </em>as in these examples:</p>
<p><em>The management team is trying to <u>combine youth with experience.</u></em></p>
<p><em>When you <u>combine talent and hard work</u>, you will see positive results. </em></p>
<p>"Integrate" can sometimes give a sense of deeper connection among two or more things than "combine." To see this, consider the word "integral." This word comes from the same root as ‘integrate.'</p>
<p>We say that something is an integral part of something else. This means that the things are deeply connected or important to each other. For example:</p>
<p><em>Bicycles are an <u>integral part of traffic and culture</u> in the Netherlands. </em></p>
<p><em>Fishing is an <u>integral part of the coastal economy</u>. </em></p>
<p>Last, both the words "integral" and "integration" have technical meanings in calculus, a field of mathematics.</p>

            <title>Scientists Propose Idea to Warm Mars (2024/8/16)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The idea of turning Mars into a livable world for humans is a common element of science fiction. But could such an action be done in real life?</p>
<p>Scientists are now proposing a new method to warm up Earth's planetary neighbor. The idea involves putting engineered particles made of iron or aluminum into the atmosphere. The goal is to trap escaping heat and direct sunlight toward the Martian surface.</p>
<p>The proposed idea would be to increase the natural greenhouse effect on Mars and raise its surface temperature by around 28 degrees Celsius over ten years.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This image taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's camera shows the Martian surface southwest of the rover's landing site. (REUTERS/NASA/JPL/Arizona State University/Cornell University/Handout)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/29242cac-bc73-4a80-aae2-cc620055d86a_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This image taken by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's camera shows the Martian surface southwest of the rover's landing site. (REUTERS/NASA/JPL/Arizona State University/Cornell University/Handout)</span></div>
<p>Such a change alone would not make Mars livable for people. But the scientists who developed the idea see it as a possible first step.</p>
<p>Edwin Kite of the University of Chicago helped lead the study that appeared recently in the publication <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>
<p>Kite described the process of terraforming – meaning to change a planet's environment to be more like Earth. "For Mars, warming the planet is a necessary, but insufficient, first step. Previous concepts have focused on releasing greenhouse gases, but these require large amounts of resources that are scarce on Mars," he said.</p>
<p>Kite added that climate modeling suggests the new idea of using engineered particles to warm Mars' atmosphere could work better than previous ideas. Kite explained that the work is important because it presents a possible method that could help future exploration plans.</p>
<p>NASA has sent robotic vehicles to explore the Martian surface and the InSight Lander to study the planet's interior. The U.S. space agency's Artemis program aims to put astronauts in the coming years on the moon's surface for the first time since 1972 in preparation for possible future human missions to Mars.</p>
<p>There are several barriers to human settlements on Mars. They include a lack of breathable oxygen, harmful ultraviolet radiation, salty soil, and dust storms that sometimes cover much of the planet. And Mars' cold temperatures are a serious issue.</p>
<p>The median Martian surface temperature is about minus-65 degrees Celsius. With its thin atmosphere, solar heat on the Martian surface easily escapes into space. The proposal would aim to permit liquid water to exist on the surface of Mars, which has water in the form of ice at its polar areas and its subsurface.</p>
<p>The scientists proposed continuously releasing tiny particles, called nanorods, into the atmosphere at a rate of about 30 liters per second for years.</p>
<p>Samaneh Ansari of Northwestern University in Illinois is the study's lead writer. Ansari said, "The idea is to either ship the material or better yet, ship the manufacturing tool and make the nanorods on the planet since iron and aluminum are abundant on the surface of Mars.”</p>
<p>The researchers are mindful of the possibility of unintended consequences in terraforming another world. Scientists, for instance, are eager to learn whether Mars has held life in the past - or perhaps currently, in the form of subsurface microbes.</p>
<p>Kite suggested that the costs and benefits of releasing nanorods are uncertain. For example, he said if Mars' soil has compounds that are harmful to life from Earth, then the benefit of warming Mars is zero.</p>

            <title>Study: Stonehenge's 'Altar Stone' Came from Far Away Scotland (2024/8/16)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Researchers are one step closer to understanding how Britain's ancient circular structure, Stonehenge, was created.</p>
<p>The circle of huge rocks stands in southern England near the tip of northeast Scotland. Its so-called altar stone lies flat in the center. The new study finds that the huge altar stone did not come from nearby Wales as had been thought. The researchers say the rock instead was carried to the site from the more distant Scotland.</p>
<p><em>Nature</em> magazine published the study on Wednesday. The research did not show how the five-meter-long stone was carried to the site. But the scientists said it traveled about 740 kilometers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Revelers gather at the ancient stone circle Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, near Salisbury, England, Wednesday, June 21, 2023.

(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)</span></div>
<p>“It's a surprise that it's come from so far away,” said University of Exeter archaeologist Susan Greaney, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>For more than a hundred years, scientists believed that Stonehenge's central sandstone slab — long called the “altar stone" — came from much closer Wales. But a study last year by some of the researchers showed that the stone did not <strong>match </strong>the <strong>geology</strong> of Wales' sandstone formations. The actual source of the stone remained unknown until now.</p>
<p>For the study, the team tested mineral content in pieces of rock that had been collected in past digs. They found a match in the sandstone formations of Orcadian Basin in northeastern Scotland. The area includes parts of the end of the Scottish <strong>peninsula</strong> as well as the Orkney Islands.</p>
<p>“That <strong>geological</strong> ‘fingerprint' isn't repeated in any other area of <strong>sediment</strong> in the U.K.,” said Aberystwyth University geologist Nick Pearce, one of the study writers.</p>
<p>Greaney said the operational complexity of moving the stone so far suggests a high level of planning, cooperation and cultural connection between these two parts of ancient Britain.</p>
<p>Stonehenge went up around 5,000 years ago. Its design creates a kind of “window” that fully frames the sun as it rises on the summer <strong>solstice</strong>. The ancient purpose of the altar stone remains a mystery.</p>
<p>“Stonehenge isn't a settlement site, but a place of ceremony...,” said Heather Sebire, with English Heritage, an aid organization that cares for hundreds of historic British sites and structures. Sebire said that past archaeological digs had not uncovered evidence of daily living at Stonehenge.</p>
<p>Past research has shown cultural connections — such as similarities in <strong>pottery</strong> making — between the area around Stonehenge and Scotland's Orkney Islands. Other stones at Stonehenge came from western Wales.</p>
<p>Britain is home to other ancient stone circles. But, study writer Richard Bevins of Aberystwyth University says, “the thing that's <strong>unique</strong> about Stonehenge is the distance from which the stones have been sourced.”</p>

<p>An agency of Japan's government recently gave its first-ever "megaquake advisory," or warning message.</p>
<p>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued the warning after a powerful quake struck on August 8 off the southeastern coast of Japan's main island of Kyushu.</p>
<p>The <strong>magnitude</strong> 7.1 quake caused no deaths or severe damage, but the advisory has led to questions and a sense of worry. Japan is among the countries most hit by earthquakes. Now many citizens are wondering about when the next big quake will hit.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Stone lanterns fall at a shrine following a strong earthquake in Nichinan, Miyazaki prefecture, southern Japan, on Aug. 9, 2024.

<p>The Associated Press recently explained what the advisory means, what people are being told to do:</p>
<p><strong>What is a megaquake advisory?</strong></p>
<p>JMA issued the advisory after deciding that the August 8 quake increased the likelihood of another major quake.</p>
<p>The agency said there is a 70 to 80 percent chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake associated with an area called the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years. The JMA said the probability of such an event is now "higher than normal."</p>
<p>Naoshi Hirata is a <strong>seismologist</strong> at the University of Tokyo and head of the JMA's group of experts. He said that the warning was not a prediction that a megaquake will happen at any specific time or place. He urged people to remain careful and prepared.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Nankai Trough?</strong></p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_megathrust_earthquakes#/media/File:RuptureAreasNankaiMegathrust_2013.png" target="_self">Nankai Trough</a> is an undersea <strong>trench</strong>, or a deep valley on the ocean floor, that runs from the waters just off the southeastern coast of Kyushu, to Suruga Bay in central Japan. It is about 800 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Two large areas of the Earth's surface, the Philippine Sea <strong>Plate</strong> and the Eurasian Plate meet there. The Philippine plate slowly pulls down on the Eurasian plate and causes it to release energy from time to time. The JMA said that could lead to a megaquake and tsunami.</p>
<p>The last Nankai Trough quake was off Shikoku in 1946. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated its magnitude to be 8.3, and more than 1,400 people died.</p>
<p><strong>What is the government doing to prepare?</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the "megaquake advisory," Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida canceled a trip and announced he would lead the government response. Local governments are studying their emergency plans.</p>
<p>Experts and officials have urged people to stay calm and to continue normal life but to prepare for a possible <strong>evacuation</strong>.</p>
<p>JMA experts said on August 12 they have so far found no abnormal activity that would suggest a megaquake.</p>
<p><strong>How are people reacting?</strong></p>
<p>The "megaquake advisory” is filled with scientific terms. It has worried people across the country. Some towns closed beaches and canceled yearly events. This has led to problems for travelers during Japan's Obon holiday week, a time for festivals and fireworks across the nation.</p>
<p>Some stores are running out of emergency supplies, even in areas where there is little risk. In the vacation town of Matsuyama city on the island of Shikoku, hotels and <strong>resorts</strong> studied their evacuation plans and emergency equipment. In another seaside town, Shirahama, outdoor hot springs were closed for a week and a fireworks festival was cancelled.</p>

            <title>Everyday Grammar: Beating Problems with Adverbs (2024/8/16)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Adam Brock</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">15 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>
For VOA Learning English, this is Everyday Grammar.</p>
<p>This week, we're going to talk about some common problems with <strong>adverbs</strong>. Basically, adverbs are words that describe verbs, <strong>adjectives</strong>, and other adverbs. For example, "I ran quickly to the store." The adverb <em>quickly</em> describes the verb <em>run</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is an adverb?</strong></p>
<div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1da030e9-e522-43e4-ac8d-a160b9a20b57_tv_w100_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>If a word is not easy to <strong>classify</strong> as a noun, verb, or adjective, it is probably an adverb. Some of the most common words in English are adverbs, including <em>up, so, just, then, how, now, also, here,</em> and<em> more.</em></p>
<p>Adverbs usually describe verbs. They express <em>when, how, where, and why</em> an action is done. Many adverbs are easy to find because they have the <em>–ly</em> ending, such as <em>quickly, surely, </em>and<em> certainly</em>. However, many adverbs do not have the <em>–ly</em> ending.</p>
<p>Adverbs can also describe adjectives. For example, "It is really cold today." In this example,<em> really</em> is an adverb that describes the adjective <em>cold</em>.</p>
<p>Adverbs can describe other adverbs. For example, "I will probably never go back." Here, the adverb <em>probably</em> describes the adverb <em>never</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you put the adverb?</strong></p>
<p>Where do adverbs go in a sentence? Well, it depends.</p>
<p>Some adverbs can go almost anywhere in a sentence. Let us look at the adverb<em> sometimes</em>. It can go at the beginning of the sentence as in, "Sometimes, I walk to work." It can go after the subject: "I sometimes walk to work." Or it can go at the end of the sentence: "I walk to work sometimes."</p>
<p>Other adverbs can only go in the middle of a sentence. The adverb <em>probably</em> is an example. "She will <em>probably</em> leave early."</p>
<p>It is incorrect to say, "Probably she will leave early" or "She will leave early probably." Other such adverbs are <em>never, rarely, seldom,</em> and<em> always</em>. These are called <strong>mid-sentence adverbs</strong>. They usually go between the subject and the main verb. Different types of adverbs have different <a class="wsw__a" href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/adverbs-and-adverb-phrases-position">sentence positions.</a></p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between adverbs and adjectives?</strong></p>
<p>Adjectives describe nouns, while adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Take the sentence, "She is careful." The adjective<em> careful</em> is describing the noun <em>she</em>. But if you said, "She walks carefully," the adverb <em>carefully</em> is describing the verb <em>walk</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think this is hard? Hardly!</strong></p>
<p>Native speakers sometimes confuse adverbs and adjectives.</p>
<p>The words <em>hard </em>and<em> hardly</em> are especially difficult. <em>Hard</em> is both an adjective and an adverb. You can say "The bed was <em>hard</em>," using the adjective, which means it is "very firm." You can also say, "I worked <em>hard</em>," using the adverb, which means "with a lot of effort."</p>
<p><em>Hardly</em> is an adverb. A long time ago, it meant "in a hard manner," but its meaning has changed. People used to say "not hardly.” Over time, the word “not” disappeared. Since the 1500s, <em>hardly</em> has meant "almost not" or "barely." For example, "I hardly had time to finish the project." This conflicting meaning of <em>hard</em> and <em>hardly</em> has become the basis for jokes.</p>
<p>Listen to cartoon character Homer Simpson playing with the confusion between <em>hard</em> and <em>hardly</em>. In the scene, Homer's co-workers are replaced with robots.</p>
<p><em>"So you guys are my new co-workers. So working hard or hardly working? (laugh). I said, ‘Working hard or hardly working?' ‘Working hard or hardly working? WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?' IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION!"</em></p>
<p>Homer is asking the robots if they are <em>working hard</em> (working with energy) or <em>hardly working</em> (only working a little). The robots, with their exact reasoning, do not understand the <strong>word play</strong> in the question.</p>
<p>We will leave you with a song that uses the adverb <em>softly </em>in an unexpected way. Listen to the Fugees' version of the classic song "Killing Me Softly with His Song."</p>
<p><em>Strumming my pain with his fingers</em></p>
<p><em>Singing my life with his words</em></p>
<p><em>Killing me softly with his song</em></p>
<p><em>Killing me softly with his song</em></p>
<p> </p>

<p>And I'm Ashley Thompson.</p>

            <title>Study: Hottest Oceans in 400 Years Endanger Great Barrier Reef (2024/8/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202408/study-hottest-oceans-in-400-years-endanger-great-barrier-reef.mp3"/>

<p>New research shows that water temperatures in and around Australia's Great Barrier Reef have risen to their warmest in 400 years over the past 10 years. The rising temperatures have put the world's largest reef under threat.</p>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest living ecosystem. It stretches for 2,400 kilometers off the coast of the northern state of Queensland.</p>
<p>A group of scientists at universities across Australia removed core samples from the coral. They examined the samples to measure summer ocean temperatures going back to the year 1618. The scientists combined information from core samples with ship and satellite <strong>data</strong> going back around 100 years.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority the Hardy Reef is viewed from the air near the Whitsunday Islands, Australia, June 22, 2014.

<p>The results show that ocean temperatures were unchanged for hundreds of years. But starting in 1900, the ocean temperatures began to rise. The research found that this is the result of human influence.</p>
<p>From 1960 to 2024, the study's writers observed an average yearly warming for January to March of 0.12 degrees Celsius per <strong>decade</strong>.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the reef has experienced five summers of mass coral bleaching. This is when large parts of the reef turn white due to <strong>heat stress</strong>. This also puts the coral at greater risk of death. The mass bleaching events happened during five of the six warmest years in the last four centuries, the study showed.</p>
<p>This research appeared on August 8 in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>"The world is losing one of its<strong> icons</strong>," said Benjamin Henley. He is with the University of Melbourne and is one of the study's co-writers.</p>
<p>"I find that to be an <strong>absolute</strong> tragedy. It's hard to understand how that can happen on our watch in our lifetime. So it's very sad,” Henley added.</p>
<p>The last temperature measurement, from January to March of this year, was the highest on record. Henley added that it was "head and shoulders" above any other year, meaning it was much higher.</p>
<p>Coral reefs are important for many reasons. They protect shorelines from <strong>erosion</strong>. They are home to thousands of kinds of fish. And they are an important part of the <strong>tourism</strong> industry<strong> </strong>in many countries. In Australia, the Great Barrier Reef adds $4.2 billion to the economy each year.</p>
<p>At least 54 countries and areas have experienced mass bleaching of their reefs since February 2023, as climate change warms the ocean's surface waters. That information comes from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

            <title>Tech Tip: Google Wallet Now Creates Digital IDs from Photos (2024/8/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202408/tech-tip-google-wallet-now-creates-digital-ids-from-photos.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">14 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Google has added a new tool that permits Android users to create digital versions of many kinds of identification (ID) cards and event passes for device <strong>wallets</strong>.</p>
<p>The tool is part of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://wallet.google/">Google Wallet</a> <strong>app</strong>. It was first announced in May along with other changes to the latest operating system, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/get">Android 15</a>. The change <a class="wsw__a" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060038#zippy=%2Cadd-items-from-a-photo-us-only">is explained</a> on a Google Wallet help website. The tool is now available for Android users in the United States who have the latest update of Google Wallet.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are designed to permit users to save non-physical versions of credit cards, personal IDs, membership passes and event tickets to their smartphones or other devices. Credit cards in wallets are linked directly to the banks that offer them and can be used to pay for things just like with a physical credit card.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Google Wallet logo is on display during a news conference, Thursday, May 26, 2011, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-891f-08dcbc7d06db_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The Google Wallet logo is on display during a news conference, Thursday, May 26, 2011, in New York.

<p>The use of digital wallets has expanded over the years as people depend more on digital IDs and other documents. Supporters say this reduces the need to carry a lot of cards in a physical wallet.</p>
<p>Until now, Google Wallet divided its digital document offerings into <strong>categories</strong>. Examples of these categories would be payment or gift cards, transportation passes for bus, train or air travel as well as official IDs.</p>
<p>Google's new tool is designed to permit device users to easily add many more kinds of documents to its Wallet service. These could include the kinds of passes many people carry in their physical wallets, such as <strong>gym </strong>memberships and medical or <strong>insurance </strong>cards.</p>
<p>These digital versions can be created by the user taking a picture of the physical document or by doing a screen capture of a digital version from a device. Some documents have an electronic <strong>barcode</strong> or QR code that can be entered into the Wallet app.</p>
<p>Google Wallet then uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to use information from the photo to create a new digital pass.</p>
<p>The process of creating these digital documents is similar to adding new documents to Google Wallet. Users open the app and then click on “Add to Google Wallet (+).” The app then gives users a choice of what kind of card or pass to create. These include groups like “Payment Card,” “Transit Pass” or “ID Card.”</p>
<p>The new Google Wallet has a new category, called “Everything Else.” This offering was created to permit users to make digital copies of just about any card, pass or document they want to keep in their devices.</p>
<p>Google offers additional security steps to users storing official documents on Android devices. These “private passes” <a class="wsw__a" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/13026633?hl=en">can also be added</a> to Google Wallet. Google says data contained in official digital documents is only saved on the device as an extra security measure.</p>
<p>People in some American states can create a digital ID to be used to officially prove their identity. Google <a class="wsw__a" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12436402?hl=en">explains</a> that this service is currently only available in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia and Maryland</p>
<p>There is a process users must follow to have their digital IDs <strong>verified</strong> by each state. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) even accepts this form of state ID at <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/when-will-phased-digital-id-rollout-start-which-airportsstates">many major U.S. airports</a>.</p>
<p>Online technology website <em>Android Authority</em> recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-e-passport-support-3444362/">reported</a> Google Wallet will soon be equipped to also create digital versions of American passports. To create this official digital document, users would need to be holders of a U.S. government issued <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.dhs.gov/e-passports">e-Passport</a>.</p>
<p>The online publication said one of its writers discovered the Google Wallet passport is still in development at Google. <em>Android Authority </em>noted that having a passport saved in Google Wallet might remove the need to present an actual passport in some cases. However, the digital version is not designed to replace the physical passport, which the user should continue to carry.</p>

<p>In the green hills of central Bosnia and Herzegovina, Halim Zukic has recreated a nature park in the form of one of Vincent van Gogh's most famous paintings, <em>The Starry Night</em>.</p>
<p>Zukic is from the town of Visoko. He decided to create a park after buying some land and a small house in a nearby village 20 years ago. But he had no clear idea of what the park should look like.</p>
<p>Then he saw <strong>tractors</strong> moving among fields of tall grass six years ago. He also saw that the tractors made circular shapes in the earth. This reminded him of similar shapes in Van Gogh's painting.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Still image from drone footage of The Starry Night nature park near Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<p>"From that moment, I was no longer <strong>in doubt</strong>," Zukic told Reuters news agency. But his effort took him time, money, and a lot of work.</p>
<p>To match the painting, Zukic brought in 130,000 lavender plants in six colors. Plants known for their <strong>aromas</strong> and medicinal uses were also planted. These include sage, echinacea, wormwood and chamomile. Together, they form colorful circles and help recreate the appearance of Van Gogh's painting.</p>
<p>Zukic also planted more trees and created 13 small lakes using water from the area.</p>
<p>Zukic did the work to form the land into the same shape as the painting by himself. He said recreating the painting has helped him better understand artists and the creative problems they face.</p>
<p>"This is the largest representation of The Starry Night, and the result of 20 years of dreams, of living those dreams to make them real," he said.</p>
<p>The park is 10 hectares in size. Zukic said it will show art programs and <strong>promote</strong> central Bosnia's cultural <strong>heritage</strong>. Zukic also wants the park to offer visitors a place to rest and think.</p>
<p>Van Gogh was born in 1853 in the Netherlands and died in 1890 in France.</p>

<p>But the children, who attend Roberta T. Smith Elementary School in the city of Rex, were in no hurry to leave. They were ready for one of their favorite parts of the day.</p>
<p>The children closed their eyes and moved their thumbs from their foreheads down to their hearts. “Listen to the <strong>chimes</strong>,” said the teacher, Kim Franklin. “Remember to breathe.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Aniyah Woods meditates in her classroom at Roberta T.

<p>Across the country, schools like Smith Elementary have been introducing mental health sessions that include yoga, meditation and mindfulness exercises. Students do these exercises in addition to traditional math, reading and science classes.</p>
<p><strong>Mindfulness alongside math</strong></p>
<p>More American students have faced mental health struggles following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2023, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that more than one-third of students were affected by feelings of long-term sadness and hopelessness. The agency suggested schools use mindfulness practices to help students deal with their stress and emotions.</p>
<p>“We know that our teenagers and <strong>adolescents</strong> have really <strong>strained</strong> in their mental health,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told The Associated Press. “There are real skills that we can give our teens to make sure that they are <strong>coping</strong> with some big emotions.”</p>
<p><strong>Poor communities need more help</strong></p>
<p>Research has found that school-based mindfulness programs can help, especially in poor communities where students face higher levels of stress.</p>
<p>GreenLight Fund Atlanta helps school systems in the state of Georgia pay for a mindfulness program called Inner Explorer. That is the program used at Smith Elementary, where more than two-thirds of students are Black.</p>
<p>Joli Cooper is GreenLight Fund Atlanta's executive director. Cooper said it was important to the group to support communities of color in the area.</p>
<p>“When you look at the numbers, unfortunately, in Georgia, the number of children of color with suicidal thoughts and success is quite high,” Cooper said. “When you look at the number of psychologists available for these children, there are not enough <strong>psychologists</strong> of color.”</p>
<p>Information from the CDC shows that Black youth have the fastest-growing suicide rate among racial groups. Between 2007 and 2020, the suicide rate among Black children and teens between the ages of 10 to 17 increased by 144 percent.</p>
<p>Nationwide, children in schools that serve mostly students of color have less access to mental health professionals than children in schools that serve mostly white students.</p>
<p>The Inner Explorer program guides students and teachers through five-to-10-minute sessions of breathing, meditation and <strong>reflection</strong> several times a day. The program is used at over 100 school systems across the U.S.</p>
<p>Teachers and administrators say they have noticed a difference in their students since they've added mindfulness into their daily activities.</p>
<p>Nine-year-old Aniyah Woods is a student in Kim Franklin's class at Smith Elementary. Aniyah said the program has helped her “calm down” and “not stress anymore.” She added, “It made me feel peaceful.”</p>
<p>Malachi Smith, also 9, has used his exercises at home. His father helps guide him through meditation.</p>
<p>“You can relax... and when I calm myself down, I realize I am an excellent <strong>scholar</strong>,” Malachi said.</p>

            <title>Student Uprising in Bangladesh Part of History of Political Protest (2024/8/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Protests in Bangladesh that involved many students have led to the long-time prime minister fleeing the country.</p>
<p>The developments in the South Asian country are among the most recent incidents in which students and other young people played an important part. They have brought down governments or forced them to change policies. Recently, the Associated Press (AP) listed some historic protests:</p>
<p><strong>Bangladesh</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - University students shout slogans during a protest to demand justice for the victims killed in the recent countrywide deadly clashes and ask for their campuses to be opened, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, July 31, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>In Bangladesh, weeks of protests against a system that set aside government jobs for the families of veterans with ruling party ties forced the prime minister from office.</p>
<p>The demonstrations against the <strong>quotas</strong> for government jobs began peacefully last month. Students are said to have led <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_RkLwIPvw">the protests</a> against the system for government jobs. They said it unfairly favored those with ties to the ruling party.</p>
<p>On July 15, student protesters fought with security officials and pro-government activists. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled last week after the unrest. It is estimated that nearly 300 people died in the violence including students and police officers.</p>
<p><strong>Gota Go Gama protests in Sri Lanka</strong></p>
<p>As in Bangladesh, young people took part in widespread protests in Sri Lanka in 2022. The protesters blamed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the economic collapse of the country and corruption.</p>
<p>In April 2022, university students and other young people occupied an area next to the president's office in the capital Colombo. They demanded that the president and his government resign. They called the camp "Gota Go Gama," or "Gota Go Village," a play on Gotabaya's <strong>nickname</strong> "Gota."</p>
<p>The protest area grew. Gotabaya Rajapaksa held onto power until July, when protesters <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/sri-lankan-president-flees-protesters-storm-pm-s-office-/6657380.html">stormed his official residence</a>. He fled the country and later resigned.</p>
<p><strong>Athens Polytechnic uprising in Greece</strong></p>
<p>In November 1973, students at Athens Polytechnic university rose up against the military dictatorship that ruled Greece for more than six years.</p>
<p>Student protests began peacefully with a strike on November 14 of that year. The students stopped attending classes and occupied the <strong>campus</strong> at the university in Athens. By the next day, thousands from around Athens had joined to support the students and the demonstrations grew. People called for an end to the dictatorship.</p>
<p>On November 17, the military attacked the protestors, killing many students and injuring more than 1,100. After a series of events, Greece, the birthplace of democracy, returned to that form of government in 1974.</p>
<p><strong>Kent State demonstrations in the United States</strong></p>
<p>President Richard Nixon approved attacks on neutral Cambodia in April 1970. That policy was an attempt to close enemy supply lines, but it expanded the conflict. American students had already been protesting the U.S. involvement in Vietnam for years.</p>
<p>On May 4, hundreds of students at Ohio's Kent State University gathered to protest the bombing of Cambodia. Officials called in the Ohio National Guard to break up the protest.</p>
<p>The National Guard used tear gas as they moved forward. For reasons that are still not clear, some National Guard members opened fire on the crowd. Four students were killed, and nine others wounded.</p>
<p>The deaths were a defining moment for a nation divided over the long war, in which more than 58,000 Americans died.</p>
<p>One result was a strike by an estimated 4 million students across the U.S. About 900 colleges and universities closed temporarily. Historians argue that the events helped turn public opinion against the conflict in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Soweto Uprising in South Africa</strong></p>
<p>In the struggle against white minority rule in South Africa, an important moment came in 1976 in the Soweto area of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>On June 16, Black students began to protest against being forced to study in Afrikaans, the language of the country's white rulers. The country was ruled under a system of racial separation called apartheid.</p>
<p>People in other areas of South Africa joined protests to express opposition to apartheid. The government's effort to control the uprising led to deaths estimated to be in the hundreds.</p>
<p>Worldwide attention and support for the protesters brought the end of apartheid years later. South Africa held democratic elections in 1994.</p>
<p><strong>Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia</strong></p>
<p>In 1989, the Communist governments of Eastern Europe were beginning to fail. After riot police suppressed a student protest in Prague on November 17, widespread demonstrations against the Communist rulers started in what was then known as Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>On November 20, many others joined the students and an estimated 500,000 took to the streets of Prague.</p>
<p>Because the protests were non-violent, they were called the "Velvet Revolution." They led to the resignation of the Communist Party's leadership on November 28.</p>
<p>By December 10, Czechoslovakia had a new government. On December 29, parliament elected the writer Vaclav Havel, who had spent several years in prison. In 1992, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p>

            <title>Banksy Announces Series of New Works (2024/8/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The famous street artist known as Banksy recently announced a new painting on another wall along a street in London. The image is of a<strong> rhinoceros</strong> that appears to be climbing on top of a real car parked in front of the mural.</p>
<p>The work is part of a new series of animal-centered murals that Banksy has created in the British capital. The collection includes paintings of elephants, a goat, a wolf, <strong>pelicans</strong> and more.</p>
<p>The secretive artist, who has never confirmed his official identity, has been announcing the new work on his Instagram social media page.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An artwork by street artist Banksy, the seventh to released this week, depicting fish swimming around a Police Box, is pictured in the City of London, on August 11, 2024.

<p>One of the pieces shows a group of the sharp-toothed fish called piranhas. That piece was painted on a police emergency call box near the Central Criminal Court, known as the Old Bailey.</p>
<p>A small crowd of people gathered near that artwork recently, taking photographs as some city workers placed barriers around it. A spokesman for the city government said it is considering how to <strong>preserve</strong> the work.</p>
<p>Another recent work is of pelicans eating fish. The mural was painted above the sign of a fish market in east London. Another Banksy painting appeared on a satellite dish. It showed a wolf, mouth open and head pointed up, as if howling.</p>
<p>However, that artwork did not remain in place long. A video posted online shows three men removing the piece and carrying it away hours after Banksy announced its existence.</p>
<p>Banksy began his career by <strong>spray-painting</strong> buildings in Bristol, England. He has since become one of the world's best-known artists. His work has sold for millions of dollars.</p>

            <title>World's Largest 3D Printed Community Nears Completion (2024/8/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Like other <strong>3D printers</strong>, the Vulcan printer puts down <strong>layer</strong> by layer of materials to build an object. However, this printer is more than 13.7 meters wide and prints homes for people to live in.</p>
<p>This summer, the robotic printer from the homebuilder ICON will complete the last of the 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community about 48 kilometers from Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world's largest 3D-printed community in November 2022.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A drone image shows 3D-printed homes in the Wolf Ranch community in Georgetown, Texas, June 27, 2024. (REUTERS/Evan Garcia)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/e75b838f-4b38-4102-ae01-fc31770c473a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A drone image shows 3D-printed homes in the Wolf Ranch community in Georgetown, Texas, June 27, 2024. (REUTERS/Evan Garcia)</span></div>
<p>Compared to traditional homebuilding, the company says 3D printing is faster, less costly, requires fewer workers, and reduces waste.</p>
<p>Conner Jenkins, a project leader, said, "It brings a lot of <strong>efficiency</strong> to the trade market... So, when there were maybe five different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew and one robot."</p>
<p>After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed together and put into the printer, a device called a nozzle releases the concrete mixture. The process looks like toothpaste being put onto a toothbrush, as the printer builds up the house layer by layer along an exact path.</p>
<p>The three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks to finish printing, with the <strong>foundation</strong> and metal roofs put in place with traditional building methods.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to water, <strong>mold</strong>, insects and extreme weather.</p>
<p>Lawrence Nourzad, 32, and his girlfriend Angela Hontas, 29, purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.</p>
<p>"It feels like a<strong> fortress</strong>," Nourzad said, adding that he was confident the home would hold up to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>The walls also provide strong<strong> insulation</strong> from the Texas heat, the couple said. The materials keep the inside temperature cool even when the air conditioner is not put on high levels.</p>
<p>There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.</p>
<p>Nourzad said, "Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that's what provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn't <strong>transfer</strong> through these walls very well."</p>
<p>To deal with this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch homeowners use mesh internet routers. These routers broadcast a signal from several units placed throughout a home, whereas a traditional router sends a signal from one device.</p>
<p>The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch cost from $450,000 to nearly $600,000. Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have been sold.</p>
<p>ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one day take its technology to the Moon.</p>
<p>NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon exploration program, has an agreement for ICON to develop a system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures on the moon's surface.</p>

            <title>Study: Moon’s Thin Atmosphere Likely Formed by Meteorite Strikes (2024/8/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202408/study-moon-s-thin-atmosphere-likely-formed-by-meteorite-strikes.mp3"/>

<p>Scientists say new examinations of soil collected on the moon suggest its atmosphere might have been created by repeated <strong>meteorite</strong> strikes.</p>
<p>Researchers studying the moon first used instruments to confirm it had an atmosphere in the early 1970s. The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/facts/">explains</a> the moon's atmosphere is “very thin and weak.” It is technically considered an “<strong>exosphere</strong>.”</p>
<p>The newly examined soil was collected by NASA astronauts during America's Apollo program from 1969 to 1972. The trips resulted in astronauts capturing about 382 kilograms of rocks and soil, called samples.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A view of the moon over a mountain in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, July 19, 2024. (REUTERS/Angelika Warmuth)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-4bdb-08dcb88f0702_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A view of the moon over a mountain in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, July 19, 2024. (REUTERS/Angelika Warmuth)</span></div>
<p>Instead of attempting to measure the moon's atmosphere in a direct way, investigators looked to the old soil material. They theorized that the soil should contain <strong>residue</strong> material from atoms released into the lunar atmosphere over billions of years.</p>
<p>The research was led by scientists at the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Their results recently appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm7074">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Science Advances</em>. Nicole Nie was the lead writer of the study. She is a planetary scientist at MIT.</p>
<p><strong>Meteorite impacts</strong></p>
<p>Nie said that when meteorites impact, or hit, an object like the moon, they create very high temperatures. Such strikes can heat up the surface by 2,000 to 6,000 degrees Celsius. These extreme temperatures melt and <strong>vaporize</strong> rocks at the surface and release atoms contained in dust and soil into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some of the atoms end up being pushed into space, while others remain just above the surface. The researchers said the soil examinations led to the discovery that the moon's atmosphere was formed through a process known as “impact vaporization.”</p>
<p>Nie and her team centered their examinations on two main elements – potassium and rubidium. These substances were chosen because they can easily be vaporized by meteorite hits. The process involved studying the behaviors of different kinds of isotopes found in potassium and rubidium. That study persuaded the team that repeated meteorite strikes formed the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the past, studies have shown the moon's atmosphere might have been created by either meteor activity or the solar wind. Solar wind describes a continuous flow of charged particles from the sun that spreads across the solar system.</p>
<p>The researchers said the latest study provides new evidence that most of the lunar atmosphere was likely formed by repeated meteorite hits over billions of years. After testing 10 samples of lunar soil, the team concluded that much more of the atmosphere is due to meteor activity than to the solar wind.</p>
<p>“At least 70 percent of the lunar atmosphere is created by these meteorite impacts,” Nie <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-study-reveals-why-moon-has-very-thin-atmosphere">said</a> in a statement. “A much smaller percentage is created by the solar wind abrasion of the surface,” she added.</p>
<p>Nicolas Dauphas is a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago. He helped lead the research. Dauphas <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-study-reveals-why-moon-has-very-thin-atmosphere">said</a>, “It turns out the answer to this longstanding question was right in front of us – <strong>preserved</strong> in lunar soil brought back to Earth by the Apollo missions.”</p>
<p>Nie said understanding such processes can be extremely valuable to planning future missions to the moon, Mars and beyond. “If humans want to move to different planetary bodies someday, we will have to understand what's going on at the surface to be able to prepare.” She added, “Each planetary body is different, and the more we understand about these processes, the more complete picture we'll have.”</p>

<p>Working from home in a small apartment is fine during the day. But when nighttime comes, it may be more difficult to turn off work and get a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>This can be especially difficult in a <strong>studio apartment</strong>. In a studio apartment, the living room, kitchen and sleeping area are all in one room.

<p>“The <strong>primary</strong> rule, maybe the only rule of small space design, is people have to be honest about how they really live,” says Olivia Hosken. She is deputy managing editor of House Beautiful.</p>
<p>She adds that when you have limited space, you need furniture that works well in the room.</p>
<p><strong>A good bed is important for good sleep</strong></p>
<p>She suggests spending money on a high-quality bed. Even better is a high-quality sleep sofa that can double as a bed and couch. She does not suggest big tables or chairs that you may not use.</p>
<p>Andrea Morris is an interior designer with Lancaster Place Interiors in Wilmington, North Carolina. For studio apartments, she likes wall beds. These can be folded up next to a wall when not in use.</p>
<p>They are better known as Murphy beds, named after William Murphy. He came up with this idea in 1900 while living in his own studio apartment in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p><strong>Create a sleep area</strong></p>
<p>To separate your sleep area from the rest of the apartment, you can purchase a freestanding screen or room divider. And as much as you can, keep your sleep area strictly for sleeping, experts say.</p>
<p>Jeff Kahn is co-founder of the Chicago-based sleep-research company Rise Science. His company developed a sleep-tracking app called Rise. His suggestion is to “avoid doing work or anything stressful from your bed.” He said that this helps the brain connect your bed with only sleep rather than wakefulness and work.</p>
<p>However, that is not always possible. If you use your bed during the daytime, you can do small things to keep daytime tasks and sleep separate. Lisa Strauss is a <strong>psychologist</strong> and expert in sleep disorders. She suggests using one side of the bed for reading and the other for sleeping. You can also bring out special blankets and pillows used only for sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>Freshen the air. Lower the lights. Cut the noise.</strong></p>
<p>Kahn also suggests keeping a clean, peaceful environment. For starters, he says to make sure the air flow is good.</p>
<p>“Make sure your space is well <strong>ventilated</strong>, and consider an <strong>air</strong> <strong>purifier</strong>,” says Kahn. He adds that this is especially important if you cook and sleep in the same place.</p>
<p>Another interior expert is Mia Ingui. She is editor at Spruce, a home design website. She suggests using calming smells like lavender or chamomile at bedtime, to “set the <strong>tone</strong> for restful sleep.”</p>
<p>Also, be sure that computer, TV, and other electronic screens are turned off. In a small room, these devices are probably a short distance from the bed. Their light at night can affect our internal clocks, or <strong>circadian rhythm</strong>.</p>
<p>Do not forget about the sounds these devices make. If the buzz of nearby devices, appliances, or street sounds keep you awake, consider a noise machine. Ingui likes the Hatch Restore, a “sunrise lamp” that provides soothing sounds and lights up slowly in the morning. You can also buy noise cancelling curtains. These cut down on outside noises.</p>
<p><strong>Keep things clean and organized</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Morris, the home designer, says one thing to avoid when it comes to studio living is leaving beds unmade.</p>
<p>“It's amazing how much better you feel after a hard day entering a space with a made bed,” she said.</p>
<p>At night, she suggests putting away electronics. Side tables with plugs and ports for electronics help you store devices and keep things tidy – or organized and clean. This is another example of choosing furniture that has multiple uses.</p>
<p><strong>Choose multi-use, storable bedding</strong></p>
<p>If it difficult to control your studio apartment's heating and cooling, Ingui recommends choosing materials for bedding that let the skin breathe. Such materials can keep you cool in warm weather and warm in cooler temperatures.</p>
<p>She also suggests buying several pieces of bedding that are easy to store rather than big, <strong>bulky</strong> blankets. Studio apartments often do not have a lot of storage.</p>
<p>With some thoughtful choices, your small space can have the feeling we all want from home life: calm, clean and good for both working and sleeping.</p>
<p>And that's the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>

            <title>Study: Andean Glacier Shrinking at Speed Not Seen Before (2024/8/12)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">11 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A new study finds that the<strong> </strong>glaciers across the Andes in South America are shrinking at a speed not seen before in the history of human civilization.</p>
<p>This discovery surprised scientists. At first, they only planned to study the current conditions of glaciers and how they changed through history.</p>
<p>"We thought this result was <strong>decades</strong> away," said Andrew Gorin. As lead writer of the study, he first thought the results were an accident. But later he and his team confirmed the results with more <strong>samples</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Mountaineers walk past the Iver glacier close to the El Plomo mountain summit, in the Andes mountain range, in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile, April 4, 2024.

(REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado)</span></div>
<p>Gorin said that the shrinking of glaciers is happening even faster than experts had thought.</p>
<p>He and a team of scientists carbon-dated bedrock that had been recently <strong>exposed </strong>by shrinking glaciers. They measured beryllium-10 and carbon-14 nuclide <strong>levels</strong> and found that <strong>concentrations</strong> were nearly zero.</p>
<p>He explained that if the rock can “see the sky” it collects these nuclides. He added that the <strong>decay</strong> rate of these nuclides shows that the rock had not been exposed during the Holocene Era. This era dates back 11,700 years but could go back even further.</p>
<p>"I would bet my whole life savings that in fact, these glaciers are smaller than they've been since the last interglacial period," Gorin said. The last interglacial period ended about 115,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The study collected data at four glaciers across the Andes. These glaciers make up 99 percent of the world's tropical glaciers. They are more affected by changing weather because they are regularly at or near freezing point.</p>
<p>"We think this is the <strong>canary in the coal mine</strong>, that this is going to happen everywhere before long and maybe sooner than we thought," Gorin said. (Canary in the coal mine is an expression that warns of danger. Coal miners would use a canary to tell if the oxygen levels in a coal mine were dangerous.)</p>
<p>Researchers published the new study in the journal <em>Science</em> on August 1.</p>

NASA has been using SpaceX's Crew Dragon to regularly carry astronauts and supplies to the ISS since 2020.<br/>但美国宇航局表示，如果这些问题在未来几周内无法解决，它可能会决定使用太空探索科技公司的载人龙飞船将宇航员带回地球。自2020年以来，美国宇航局一直在使用太空探索科技公司的载人龙飞船定期将宇航员和物资运送到国际空间站。</p><p>If NASA decides to use Crew Dragon, it said it would leave two of four seats open during the spacecraft's next planned launch to the ISS in late September. Wilmore and Williams would then make the trip back to Earth with Crew Dragon.<br/>如果美国宇航局决定使用载人龙飞船，它称其将在9月下旬该航天器下一次计划发射到国际空间站期间，将四个座位中的两个留空。威尔莫尔和威廉姆斯随后将与载人龙飞船一起返回地球。</p><p>NASA officials told reporters they had brought in additional experts to examine Starliner's leak issues and thruster failures.

            <title>In Warmer Weather, South Korean Farmers Try Growing Bananas (2024/8/12)</title>

<p>Ma Myung-sun had low expectations for the <strong>subtropical</strong> bananas he planted in a community farm in Seoul. He must use a <strong>greenhouse</strong> for part of the year to protect them from South Korea's cold winters.</p>
<p>But warmer temperatures due to climate change have produced a welcome surprise in the form of flowers and fruit.</p>
<p>The land area where subtropical crops are grown in South Korea has increased from about 295 hectares in 2021 to 3,306 hectares in 2023.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="South Korean farmer, Ma Myung-sun, stands next to a banana tree at his community farm in Seoul, South Korea, July 31, 2024. (REUTERS/Minwoo Park)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-4654-08dcb87137b6_cx0_cy16_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">South Korean farmer, Ma Myung-sun, stands next to a banana tree at his community farm in Seoul, South Korea, July 31, 2024. (REUTERS/Minwoo Park)</span></div>
<p>South Korea's state agricultural organization, the Rural Development Administration, reports that there are 67 banana farms in the south. And Ma is among a growing number of farmers experimenting with crops usually grown in a warmer climate.</p>
<p>"I want to try growing other tropical crops too. So, as you can see here, I have planted these papaya trees as well,” Ma said, pointing to a small papaya plant.</p>
<p>Ma opened up part of his family's farm to people from the city in 2006. He is happy about his small success. But he worries about what it means for the climate.</p>
<p>"I feel that the climate crisis has become very serious," said Ma, who has been a farmer for 25 years.</p>
<p>South Korea lies in the <strong>temperate</strong> zone and has four seasons. But its climate appears to be getting warmer and wetter throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Korea Meteorological Administration reports that since 2012, the average yearly temperature has been continually rising. The average temperature last year of 13.7 degrees Celsius was the highest since its records began in 1973.</p>
<p><strong>Plenty of rain</strong></p>
<p>Rainfall during last year's rainy season was 660.2 mm nationwide, nearly two times the 356.7 mm annual average figure.</p>
<p>Kim Kwang-soo is a professor of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Seoul National University. Kim said South Korea's climate conditions were becoming more like subtropical areas, so it is important for farmers to find the right crop varieties for the climate.</p>
<p>Tropical and subtropical fruit are usually <strong>expensive</strong> in South Korea, so shoppers should welcome the less costly local produce.</p>
<p>"My kids love bananas. So, it would be good if we harvest bananas in this country," said Kim Ji-youn, who was purchasing imported bananas in a Seoul supermarket.</p>

<p class="paragraph">And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>People around the world share many things in common. But we are also different from each other. Not only do we look, think, and act differently, but we also like different things. Even <strong>identical</strong> <strong>twins</strong> may look the same but are very different individuals.</p>
<p>On today's program, we will look at a few expressions to describe how no person is exactly the same as another.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Iris Hsueh (L) and Ian Ciou have a picture taken on October 14, 2023, at a garbage dump in Puli Township, Taiwan. The bride is serious about the environment and wants to make a statement with her wedding photos. (Photo by Handout/OWEN KANG/AFP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0a00-0242-43d9-08dbe21a7a41_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Iris Hsueh (L) and Ian Ciou have a picture taken on October 14, 2023, at a garbage dump in Puli Township, Taiwan. The bride is serious about the environment and wants to make a statement with her wedding photos. (Photo by Handout/OWEN KANG/AFP)</span></div>
<p>The first expression involves trash and treasure.</p>
<p>When we say <u>one person's trash is another person's treasure</u>,<strong> </strong>we mean that something that one person may consider worthless could be highly prized or valued by someone else.</p>
<p>Let's hear an example of how to use this expression:</p>
<p><em>A: I really don't understand the appeal of Jackson Pollock's paintings. To me, they look like a team of m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s painted them!" </em></p>
<p><em>B: I love Pollock's paintings. I see something new every time I look at them. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Well, I guess it's true what they say, <u>one person's trash is another person's treasure</u>.</em></p>
<p>Now, rubbish and garbage mean the same as trash. But, in this expression, we use trash because the “tr” in <u>trash</u> and <u>treasure</u> makes the expression sound more natural. It just sounds better.</p>
<p>And, sometimes, we use the word "man" in place of "person" such as <u>one man's trash is another man's treasure</u>. Again it is just easier to say.</p>
<p>Another expression with a similar meaning is <u>different strokes for different folks</u>.</p>
<p>This also means that different things appeal to different people. But as a set expression, we do not say “different strokes for different people.” That just doesn't sound right.</p>
<p><u>Different strokes for different folks</u> can also mean that people live in different ways and value different things.</p>
<p>For example, a perfect evening for my friend is to go out and dance all night long. For me, a perfect evening is to stay at home with a book and a cup of tea. Neither is a better way to spend the evening. So, we should not judge. Or in other words, <u>different strokes for different folks</u>.</p>
<p>When we want to say that we are all different and we like different things without judgment, we can also use the following expressions:</p>
<p><u>It takes all kinds to make the world go round.</u></p>
<p><u>It takes all kinds.</u></p>
<p><u>To each his (her) own. </u></p>
<p><u>Whatever floats your boat.</u></p>
<p>They all mean ... whatever makes you happy!</p>
<p>And all of these expressions have the same general meaning: We are all different and <strong>unique</strong>.</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>In So Many Places, Cats Are the Stars (2024/8/10)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>From the United States and Britain to Russia and South America, cats often appear in famous public places.</p>
<p>Cat fans say the animals bring value to the places where they live. Cats can add a cute element or reduce the number of rodents. Sometimes, cats even come to define the place they live in.</p>
<p><strong>Cats in the United States </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Larry the cat, Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, poses for the cameras outside 10 Downing Street in London, on March 13, 2024. (AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6c6dbe98-6b3a-4ac6-acd1-2598f11306b1_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Larry the cat, Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, poses for the cameras outside 10 Downing Street in London, on March 13, 2024.

<p>In 2020, a green-eyed cat named Willow appeared at a Joe Biden campaign event in Pennsylvania. The cat jumped onstage and left with soon-to-be first lady Jill, who later wrote a book about the creature.</p>
<p>But the White House is not the only well-known place in the United States to house cats.</p>
<p>The Hemingway Homes and Museum, in Key West, Florida has fifty-nine cats that move freely through the estate. Half of the creatures are related to Hemingway's own six-toed cat, Snow White.</p>
<p>Visitors are kept away from the furniture, but the animals sit on the writer's desk. A large “Cat Bible” shows the family history, or lineage, of the resident cats.</p>
<p>Alexa Morgan of the Hemingway museum said the cats bring extra public interest.</p>
<p>“We have visitors that come here for Hemingway, and then once they see the cats and they love them, then it's like they visit again so they can come back and see the cats,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Cats in Britain </strong></p>
<p>In Britain, there is Lilibet.</p>
<p>She is a Siberian Forest cat who spends time sitting by the fire at the Lanesborough Hotel in London. Plenty of people visit the hotel just to see the cat, who is named after Queen Elizabeth II, said managing director Stuart Geddes.</p>
<p>Lilibet has special hair known as hypoallergenic fur. That means her hair is not likely to cause problems for people who are sensitive to cat hair. Lilibet is not the only cat living in an important British building.</p>
<p>Hodge sits inside Southwark Cathedral, which was established in 1106. He moves around bringing happiness to visitors and going into the shop for treats.</p>
<p>Not far away, across the Thames River, is Larry, the famous cat of 10 Downing St., the official home of the prime minister of Britain. Larry has stayed longer than most prime ministers — Kier Starmer is his sixth.</p>
<p>Employed as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, Larry pays his way by keeping the prime minister's office and home more cat than mouse.</p>
<p>He has lasted longer than his rival Palmerston, a previous Foreign Office cat who retired to the British countryside in 2020.</p>

<p>Cats also live in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>About 80 cats get to call Catherine the Great's palace home in return for keeping the pest population down. They have their own press officer and volunteer assistants, who keep them publicized, fed, and watered while they walk around Russia's state museum.</p>
<p>In Venezuela, under a banner of Hugo Chavez, an unnamed cat has become well-known to the journalists of Caracas. Often found moving near TV crews at the National Electoral Council, this mysterious animal keeps reporters company as they wait for updates.</p>
<p>Far away in another part of the world, Lule is so beloved at the Day and Night bar in Pristina, Kosovo, that her cat face has become its symbol. Owner Genc Salihu says she is part of the family, and people come just to see and pet Lule.</p>
<p>“She is very much the soul of this place,” he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By VOA</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">09 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p><em>We present the last of three parts of the short story "Benito Cereno." It was written by Herman Melville.</em></p>
<p><em>As we told you in earlier parts of our story, rebel slaves seized the ship San Dominick off the coast of Chile. They killed many of its officers and crew. The captain, Benito Cereno, was ordered to sail to Senegal. But first, he was forced to take the ship to the lonely island of Santa Maria, near the southern end of Chile. There, it could safely get water and supplies for the long, dangerous voyage to Africa.</em></p>
<div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f0bfd657-c381-44a2-91f0-38af2c06d6b2_w100_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p><em>At the island, the rebels were surprised and frightened when they found an American ship anchored in the harbor. It also had stopped for water. Many of the rebels wanted to sail away. But their leader, Babo, opposed it. They had little water and food, and could not go far. Babo created a story to keep anyone from suspecting that the Spanish vessel was in the hands of rebels, and that its captain was a prisoner.</em></p>
<p><em>At first, Babo seemed successful. The captain of the American ship, Amasa Delano, visited the San Dominick. He suspected nothing, although surprised by the general disorder on board. He also could not understand the strange behavior of its captain, Benito Cereno. Later incidents, however, began to worry him. Captain Delano grew more and more suspicious. At one time, he even feared that his life might be in danger.</em></p>
<p><em>Twice, he caught the Spanish captain and his servant, Babo, with their heads together, whispering like two conspirators. It made Captain Delano wonder. Were they plotting to kill him and seize his ship? Who were these men, cut throats? Pirates?</em></p>
<p><em>Captian Delano grew nervous. Then, he was happy to see his whale boat off in the distance. It was returning with supplies for the Spanish ship. The sight of his boat calmed him. It made his suspicions and fear quickly disappear. He felt foolish for having had such dark thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, here is Shep O'Neal with the rest of our story, "Benito Cereno."</em></p>
<p>Captain Delano went down to Captain Cereno's cabin to cheer him up and say goodbye.</p>
<p>“Better and better, Don Benito,” he said as he entered the cabin, “your troubles will soon be over.” The American invited the Spanish captain to come aboard his boat for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Cereno's eyes brightened. But then the light in them died. He shook his head and said he could not accept the invitation. Captain Delano was offended. He was about to withdraw when Don Benito rose from his chair and took Delano's hand. The Spaniard's hand shook. And he was too excited to speak. Delano pulled his hand away and turned, climbing back to the deck. His face was troubled.</p>
<p>Captain Delano could not understand Don Benito's actions. One minute the Spaniard was warm and polite. Then -- just as quickly -- cold and hostile. Captain Delano asked himself: Why did he refuse to join me? Why is he so unfriendly?</p>
<p>Captain Delano got to the deck and was about to step down into his boat when he heard his name. To his surprise, Don Benito was calling, coming quickly toward him.</p>
<p>Captain Delano was pleased and turned back to meet him. Don Benito warmly took his hand, with more energy and emotion than he had ever shown. But his excitement seemed too much for him, and he could not speak. Babo then came between the two men and put his arm around Don Benito to support him. Clearly, he wanted to end the meeting between the two captains.</p>
<p>Walking between the two men, Babo went with them to the walkway. Don Benito would not let go of Captain Delano's hand. He held it tightly across the servant's body.</p>
<p>Soon, they were standing by the ship's side, looking down onto the American boat. Its crew turned up their wondering eyes. Captain Delano did not know what to do as he waited for Don Benito to let go of his hand. He wanted to step down into his boat. But Don Benito still firmly held his hand.</p>
<p>Then, in an excited voice the Spaniard said: “I can go no further. Here I must say goodbye. Farewell, my dear, dear Don Amasa. Go! Go!” And he tore his hand loose. “Go, and God protect you better than he did me. Go, Don Amasa, my best friend.”</p>
<p>Captain Delano was deeply moved. He would have stayed for another minute or so, but he caught the eye of Babo. It seemed to say, ‘This is bad for Don Benito's health.' And so he quickly took the short step down into his boat with the continuing farewells of Don Benito, who stood rooted at the ship's side.</p>
<p>Captain Delano sat down in the back of his boat, gave Don Benito a last salute, and ordered his men to push off. The boat began to move. Suddenly, Don Benito sprang over the side and came down at Delano's feet. And he kept shouting toward the Spanish ship. His cries were so wild that no one could understand him.</p>
<p>An American officer asked what does this mean. Captain Delano turned a cold smile upon Captain Cereno and said he neither knew nor cared. It seems, he added, that the Spaniard has taken it into his head to give his people the idea that we want to kidnap him. Or else...and suddenly Captain Delano shouted: “Watch out for your lives!” He saw Babo, the servant, on the rail above, with a <strong>dagger</strong> in his hand. He was ready to jump.</p>
<p>What followed happened so quickly that Captain Delano could not tell one <strong>incident</strong> from another. They all came together in one great blur of violent action and excitement.</p>
<p>As Babo came down, Captain Delano flung Don Benito aside and caught the rebel leader, pulling the dagger from his hand. He pushed Babo firmly down in the bottom of the boat, which now began to pick up speed. Then, Babo, with his one free hand, pulled a second dagger from his clothes and struck at Captain Cereno. Captain Delano knocked it from his hand.</p>
<p>Now, he saw everything clearly: Babo had leaped into the <strong>whale boat </strong>– not to kill him – but to kill Captain Cereno.</p>
<p>For the first time, he understood the mysterious behavior of Don Benito – a prisoner under sentence of death. He looked back at the Spanish ship and got a clear picture of what its captain had escaped.</p>
<p>On board the San Dominick, the shouting rebels were raising their axes and knives in a wild revolt. They stopped some of the Spanish sailors from jumping into the sea. A few, however, jumped, while two or three, who were not quick enough, went hurrying up the top-most wood arms.</p>
<p>Captain Delano signaled to his ship, ordering it to get its guns ready. When the whale boat reached his ship Captain Delano asked for ropes. He tied Babo, and had him pulled up on deck. A small boat was quickly sent out to pick up three Spanish sailors who had jumped from Captain Cereno's ship.</p>
<p>Captain Delano asked Don Benito what guns the rebels had. He answered that they had none that could be used. In the first days of the rebellion, a cabin passenger now dead had destroyed the few guns there were.</p>
<p>The Americans fired six shots at the San Dominick. But the rebel ship moved out of reach. Small boats were armed and lowered. Captain Delano ordered his men into them. And they moved out to capture the rebel ship.</p>
<p>The boats caught up with the San Dominick when it was nearly night. But the moon was rising, and the <strong>gunners</strong> were able to see where they were shooting. The rebels had no bullets. And they could do nothing but yell. Many of the rebels were killed and the San Dominick was captured.</p>
<p>After an investigation, Babo was found guilty of stealing a ship and of murder, and was hanged. Captain Benito Cereno never was well again and he soon died. So, ended the terrible story of the slave revolt aboard the slave ship, the San Dominick.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Ahmed in Egypt about the usage of the words “arrogance” and “ego."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-0239-08dcb2f616db_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>I'm just asking about the difference between arrogance and ego because I hear actors use them interchangeably in movies.</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for writing to us, Ahmed. I'm happy to answer this question.</p>
<p>First, let's explain the word “interchangeably." It describes using two things for the same purpose. For example, when we talk about the weather, the words “cloudy” and “overcast” mean the same thing.</p>
<p>“Ego” and “arrogance” are both nouns and are often interchangeable. The American dictionary publisher <em>Merriam-Webster </em>defines “ego” as having a sense of self-worth and “arrogance” as having a much greater sense of self-worth over others.</p>
<p>“Arrogant” and “egotistical” are the adjective forms of these words. An arrogant or egotistical person thinks he or she is better than other people.</p>
<p>You have heard actors using both terms because they usually mean the same thing. But we have particular ways of using each of these words. Here are some examples of how to use the two words:</p>
<p><em>That actor has such a big <u>ego</u>. He agrees to be in movies only if he gets to play the leading role.</em></p>
<p><em>You can feel her <u>arrogance</u> when she makes all those negative comments about other artists.</em></p>
<p>We sometimes say that a person “has a big ego." But we do not say that a person “has a big arrogance." That is because “arrogance” is a non-count noun.</p>
<p>To have “an inflated ego” is another common way of saying that a person is egotistical.</p>
<p>“Arrogance” is often used with a negative meaning. But “ego,” defined as a sense of self-worth, is neither positive nor negative. For example:</p>
<p><em>The teenage years are important for the development of a <u>healthy ego</u>.</em><em> </em></p>
<p>When a person feels their ego has been affected negatively, we say that person has “a wounded ego.”</p>
<p>And while we can use the expression “a big ego,” we rarely say “a small ego." Instead, we say a person “is not egotistical." Or, we simply say a person is <strong>humble</strong>.</p>

            <title>Are Microplastics Harmful? (2024/8/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Extremely small pieces of plastic called microplastics are in the ocean and the air, as well as in our food and water. Scientific study has discovered microplastics in human body tissues also, including the heart, liver and kidneys.</p>
<p>Some researchers worry that microplastics harm human health, although they say that science has not found clear evidence of that. Still, they say questions remain about the possible health effects of microplastics.</p>
<p>Manufacturers mostly use oil or other petroleum products to make plastic. The material is used to make a huge number of different products: water bottles, car parts, children's playthings, clothing, electronics and more. Heat, weather, and even animal <strong>digestion</strong> break down plastic into smaller and smaller pieces.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A blue piece of microplastic sits on the finger of a researcher with the University of Washington-Tacoma environmental science program, after it was found in debris collected from the Thea Foss Waterway, in Tacoma, Wash., on May 19, 2010.

<p>Microplastics can be 5 millimeters long at most or as small as one micrometer. A micrometer is one-one thousandth of a millimeter. Microplastics have been found in salt, sugar, honey, rice and seafood. They have also been found in milk, soil, and drinking water.</p>
<p><strong>Risks to the human body</strong></p>
<p>Researchers disagree about how much plastic people might be breathing in or taking in as food and drink. Still, many studies find evidence of plastics in body tissues.</p>
<p>Tracey Woodruff is a researcher at the University of California at San Francisco. She said, “Microplastics have been measured in pretty much all of the body tissues that have been <strong>evaluated</strong>.”</p>
<p>Scientists are still trying to answer the question of how harmful microplastics might be. In 2022, a World Health Organization report found no clear risk to human health, based on the available evidence.</p>
<p>There is also not clear evidence of widespread public health effects.</p>
<p>However, researchers only recently began to measure plastic levels in the human body and learn about their possible effects. Woodruff of U.C. San Francisco said it makes sense that microplastics are harmful because they contain poisonous chemicals. The researcher was part of an investigative team that examined nearly 2,000 studies about microplastics at the request of California state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Some evidence suggests plastics can increase <strong>inflammation </strong>and other changes in the body. Such changes could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing exposure to microplastics</strong></p>
<p>Researchers say there are ways to reduce possible contact with microplastics.</p>
<p>Take off your shoes before you go into your home. This helps prevent the spread of microplastics inside. Eat foods — especially fresh fruits and vegetables — that you prepare at home. Do not heat foods in plastic containers, Woodruff said. And, she added, use metal or glass water bottles, instead of plastic.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago on an Indonesian island, scientists discovered ancient bone remains of an early human <strong>species</strong> that stood about one meter tall.</p>
<p>These early humans became popularly known as “hobbits.” The name comes for the small humanlike creatures that appear in books by English writer J.R.R Tolkien.</p>
<p>Now a new study suggests ancestors of the “hobbits” were even shorter.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by Yousuke Kaifu shows an arm bone fragment excavated on the Indonesia island of Flores.

<p>Yousuke Kaifu of the University of Tokyo was a co-writer of the study. Kaifu said in an email, “We did not expect that we would find smaller individuals from such an old <strong>site</strong>.”</p>
<p>The discoverers of the first hobbit fossils named them after <strong>characters</strong> in the The Lord of the Rings books. The fossils date back to between 60,000 and 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Researchers found the new fossils at a place called Mata Menge, about 70 kilometers from the cave where researchers found the first hobbit remains.</p>
<p>In 2016, researchers suspected the earlier relatives could be shorter than the hobbits after studying a jawbone and teeth collected from the new site. Additional examination of a small arm bone piece and teeth suggests the ancestors were 6 centimeters shorter and existed 700,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Dean Falk of Florida State University was not involved with the research. Falk said that the researchers in the study have “convincingly shown that these were very small individuals.”</p>
<p>The findings appeared recently in the publication Nature Communications.</p>
<p>Researchers have debated how the hobbits – named Homo floresiensis after the Indonesian island of Flores – developed to be so small and where they fall in the human evolutionary story. Homo floresiensis are thought to be among the last early human species to die off.</p>
<p>Scientists do not yet know whether the hobbits shrank from an earlier, taller human species called Homo erectus that lived in the area, or from an even more primitive human ancestor. Scientists need more study, and more fossils, to learn the hobbits' place in human evolution, said Matt Tocheri of Canada's Lakehead University.</p>
<p>In an email, Tocheri, who was not involved in the research, wrote, “This question remains unanswered and will continue to be a focus of research for some time to come.”</p>

            <title>Study: Particles in Wildfire Smoke May Increase Dementia Risk (2024/8/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">08 August, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A new study suggests that particles found in wildfire smoke could increase the risk of getting dementia.</p>
<p>Dementia is a progressive brain condition that causes thinking problems and other health issues. There are several forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Researchers reported the new findings about wildfire smoke at the recent Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A plane drops fire retardant on the Park Fire near Forest Ranch, Calif., Sunday, July 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Nic Coury)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-a5ac-08dcb23a0b51_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A plane drops fire retardant on the Park Fire near Forest Ranch, Calif., Sunday, July 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Nic Coury)</span></div>
<p>The study centered on a substance called PM2.5. The substance is known as particulate matter, a mixture of small, solid particles and water droplets found in the air.</p>
<p>PM2.5 particles are about 30 times smaller than a human hair. They can be breathed into the lungs and then move on to the blood stream. Existing evidence shows this kind of pollution – from traffic, factories and fires – can cause or worsen heart disease. The new study finds it could also raise dementia risks.</p>
<p>Claire Sexton is the director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer's Association. She said in a statement the study shows that increasing wildfires, especially in the American west, are “an increasing threat to brain health.” Sexton added that the findings demonstrate “the importance of enacting policies to prevent wildfires and investigating better methods to <strong>address</strong> them.”</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Pennsylvania carried out the study. They examined health records of 1.2 million older adults in Southern California between 2009 and 2019. The scientists used air quality <strong>monitoring</strong> and other data to estimate how much PM2.5 was released from wildfire smoke or other ways over three years.</p>
<p>The study found the risk of being <strong>diagnosed</strong> with dementia increased about 21 percent for every 1 microgram increase in the <strong>concentration</strong> of wildfire particles. That compared with a 3 percent increased risk for every 3 microgram increase in non-wildfire particles.</p>
<p>It is not clear why this difference exists. But with wildfires increasing, this issue needs more study, said Alzheimer's Association chief science officer Maria Carrillo. She said it is especially important because the risk of Alzheimer's – the most common form of dementia – is higher for lower-income populations who may have a harder time avoiding unhealthy air.</p>
<p>Carrillo noted that health warnings urge staying indoors when air quality is poor. But she added, “there are a lot of people who don't have the <strong>option</strong> to stay home or they work outside.”</p>

<p>The Galapagos, a group of islands in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, are coming under increased pressure.</p>
<p>Observers say climate change and invasive<strong> species </strong>threaten wildlife on and around the islands, which are part of the South American country of Ecuador.</p>
<p>Warming ocean waters affect the food<strong> sources</strong> of many of the sea animals around the Galapagos.</p><div class="contentImage"><img a="" alie="" alt="A whale shark swims through the waters off of Wolf Island, Ecuador, next to Enrique " cruz="" ecuador="" from="" galapagos="" in="" island="" june="" local="" moran="" naturalist="" on="" photo="" quike="" santa="" skowronski="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2c630d2a-a854-4d87-b3b5-530a96621a88_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" sunday="" the=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A whale shark swims through the waters off of Wolf Island, Ecuador, next to Enrique "Quike" Moran, a local naturalist from Santa Cruz Island, Ecuador in the Galapagos on Sunday, June 9, 2024.

<p>Marine iguanas are one of many species that are <strong>unique</strong> to the Galapagos. The <strong>reptiles</strong> have a harder time finding the food they prefer - red and green algae. A recent Associated Press (AP) report said sea turtles struggle to <strong>nest </strong>in warmer temperatures. Raising young gets harder as water warms and fewer nutrients are available.</p>
<p>“We have something of everything here – that's why people say the Galapagos is so <strong>diverse</strong> – but we have a small number of each thing,” said Natasha Cabezas, a naturalist guide.</p>
<p><strong>A changing climate </strong></p>
<p>The Galapagos Islands are famous for animals that were studied by Charles Darwin in the 1800s. He developed the theory that living things change over large amounts of time.</p>
<p>The group of islands is where major ocean currents meet — cool water from the south, warm water from the north, and a cold current from the west. In addition to those, there is El Ni<i></i>241;o, the periodic and natural Pacific Ocean warming that affects weather worldwide.</p>
<p>While temperatures depend on the season and other natural climate events, scientists say ocean temperatures have been rising. They blame climate change caused by human activities.</p>
<p>Some scientists say the ocean has reached its warmest level since at least the 1800s within the last 10 years. The U.S. space agency NASA says 2023 was the ocean's warmest year on record.</p>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, June is the first month of winter. One of the ocean currents, the Cromwell current, brings sea creatures like whale sharks, hammerheads, and sunfish to the surface. It also provides nutrients for penguins, marine iguanas and sea lions in search of food.</p>
<p>Scientists are studying how the past year's El Ni<i></i>241;o affected those creatures.</p>
<p>El Ni<i></i>241;o can bring food shortages for some species like marine iguanas and sea turtles. Scientists observing the species have noted a decrease in their populations during El Ni<i></i>241;o events.</p>
<p>Marine iguanas were “one of the most affected species from El Ni<i></i>241;o last year and right now they are still recovering,” said Galapagos Conservancy Director Jorge Carrión.</p>
<p><strong>Invasive species </strong></p>
<p>As rising ocean temperatures threaten sea life, on land there is a different problem. Animals — cats, dogs, pigs, goats and cattle, none of them native — are threatening the unique species of the islands.</p>
<p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, many people left dogs and cats they had been taking care of, Cabezas said.</p>
<p>“If you don't take care of them, they become a problem and now it's a <strong>shame</strong> to see dogs everywhere. We have a big problem right now I don't know what we're going to do,” she said.</p>
<p>The non-native animals are a special threat to the giant tortoises of the Galapagos. The tortoises almost disappeared in the 1800s because of hunting. Officials have tried to protect them from humans. It has been illegal to kill a giant tortoise since 1933.</p>
<p>“In one night, a<strong> feral</strong> pig can destroy all nesting sites in an area,” Carrión said. Park rangers try to visit areas with nesting sites once a day and kill pigs when they find them. But the pigs are difficult to find, Carrion said.</p>
<p>Feral cats feed on young marine iguanas, and both pigs and cats compete for food with the tortoises.</p>
<p>Plastic is also a widespread problem in the world's oceans. One recent study reported microplastics in the bellies of Galapagos penguins.</p>
<p>“There are no animals in the Galapagos that do not have microplastics in their food,” Carrión said.</p>

            <title>Judge Rules Google Has Illegal Monopoly over Search (2024/8/8)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>An American judge has ruled that Google violates U.S. trade laws by operating its search engine as an illegal <strong>monopoly</strong>.</p>
<p>The ruling accuses Google of paying smartphone makers to ensure that Google's search engine is set as the <strong>default</strong> system on new devices. The U.S. Justice Department brought the <strong>antitrust</strong> case against Google's parent company, Alphabet.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said his decision took into account all evidence and statements presented during the trial, which ended in May. When the first part of the trial ended, it was up to Mehta to decide whether any of Google's operations were illegal.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This file image shows various Google logos displayed on a Google search, Monday, Sept. 11, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-62fc-08dcb71004ac_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This file image shows various Google logos displayed on a Google search, Monday, Sept. 11, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>Mehta wrote in his ruling, “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to <strong>maintain</strong> its monopoly." Technology experts have estimated Google enjoys control of about 90 percent of the online search market and about 95 percent of smartphones.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/pdf/AI_Education.pdf">A recent study</a> by the California-based investment company BOND found that Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion requests per day worldwide. That result was nearly double the number of daily search requests recorded in 2012. Google's online advertising business helps fuel the majority of Alphabet's $307 billion in yearly <strong>revenue</strong>.</p>
<p>The ruling could open the door for a second trial for the court to establish ways for Google to fix its operations to obey current laws. Some experts say one possible fix could be for Google's current business structure to be broken up. Such changes could greatly reshape the current systems for online advertising.</p>
<p>Alphabet criticized the court's ruling and said it plans to appeal. "This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine,” the company said in a statement. It added, however, that the ruling does not permit the company “to make it easily available.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the decision "a historic win for the American people.” He noted, "no company, no matter how large or influential” should remain above the law.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the decision a "pro-competition ruling” and “a victory for the American people." She said she believes all people "<strong>deserve</strong> an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition."</p>
<p>In explaining his ruling, Mehta noted Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to make sure its search engine was included as the default system on smartphones and browsers.</p>
<p>Such payments, the judge wrote, have permitted Google to keep its strong market share over worldwide internet search. Keeping the default position represents a huge business <strong>advantage</strong> for Google over its competitors, Mehta added.</p>
<p>The judge noted that under the current system, it would be nearly impossible for any other company to secure the same kind of default agreement with smartphone makers. Such a deal would require a company willing “to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue sharing,” Mehta said.</p>
<p>Discussions in court about how Google's operations should change are set to begin on September 6 in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases brought against big technology companies in recent years, including Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon. Those cases involve antitrust, privacy and other issues.</p>

            <title>Korean Air Takes Instant Noodles Off the Menu (2024/8/8)</title>

<p>For many years, cups of <strong>instant </strong>noodles have been a favorite among Korean Air passengers. However, they will no longer be available for economy-class travelers starting August 15, said a spokesperson for the Seoul-based airline.</p>
<p>Korean Air said its decision was a safety measure to deal with increased <strong>turbulence</strong>, “aimed at preventing burn accidents.” Turbulence, or irregular movements from up and down air currents, can cause the hot cups of noodles to spill.</p>
<p>In addition to regular meals, instant noodles are currently part of Korean Air's self-service food, for economy passengers on long trips. In this week's announcement, the airline added that it will offer other food items for economy travelers. The new offerings include sandwiches, corn dogs, and hot pockets.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Korean Air will no longer offer instant noodles to Economy class passengers starting August 15, 2024, a spokesperson for the Seoul-based airline confirmed.

<p>However, business-class and first-class passengers will still get their noodles. Korean Air told the BBC that the noodles are brought individually to business-class and first-class travelers. This reduces the risk of spills and burns.</p>
<p>Concern about the dangers of serving hot food and liquids on airplanes is not new. Over the years, several airlines have faced legal actions from travelers who say they suffered serious burns after having hot coffee, for example, spilled on them during a <strong>flight</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2019, the European Union's highest court ruled that an airline can be held responsible if a passenger is injured in this way. This is the case even if turbulence or other flight-related reasons did not cause the spill.</p>
<p>But turbulence, of course, still adds to the risk. Flying through unstable air can make balancing something like hot soup or drink much more difficult.</p>
<p>Several turbulence-related injuries have been reported over the years. But most injuries are minor. And airlines have made continuous improvements in reducing the number of in-flight accidents. Those include stopping service when needed or taking extra care when giving out certain drinks.</p>
<p>Still, rough air might be getting harder and harder to avoid. Weather and airline experts note increasing reports of turbulence. They point to the possible effects climate change may have on flying conditions.</p>

            <title>Severe Drought Returns to the Amazon Earlier Than Expected (2024/8/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The Amazon <strong>Basin</strong> is facing one of the most severe <strong>droughts</strong> in recent years, the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (or ACTO) said.</p>
<p>As the dry season begins in August, many of its rivers are already at very low levels. And several South American countries are preparing to deal with increasing forest fires, water shortages and higher food prices.</p>
<p>In several rivers in the southwestern Amazon, water levels are the lowest on record for this time of year. August and September are usually the driest months. That is also when most fires happen. The ACTO says the most affected countries so far this year are Bolivia, Peru and Brazil.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Boats sit on the bank of the Acre River, the main water source for the city of Rio Branco, which is facing water shortages amid a drought in Acre state, Brazil, Friday, Aug. 2, 2024.

(AP Photo/Marcos Vicentti)</span></div>
<p>Recently, Brazil's federal water agency declared a water shortage in two major basins, Madeira and Purus. Together, they cover an area nearly the size of Mexico. And in Brazil's Acre state, the drought has already caused water shortages in the city of Rio Branco. In June, neighboring Amazonas state declared a water shortage in 20 of its communities.</p>
<p>The declared shortages came more than two months earlier than last year when most of the Amazon Basin suffered its worst drought on record.</p>
<p>The 2023 drought <strong>isolated</strong> people who depend on water for transportation. Smoke from forest fires made the air in cities unhealthy to breathe. And high water temperatures killed more than 100 river dolphins.</p>
<p>The Madeira River is one of the largest rivers in the Basin. It is also an important waterway for soybeans and fuel. The river's level dropped below three meters near Porto Velho on July 20. In 2023, that happened nearly a month later on August 15.</p>
<p>The low water level means fewer boats could travel the river at night. And two of Brazil's largest hydroelectric plants may halt production, as happened last year.</p>
<p>In the Amazonas town of Envira, nearby rivers have become too <strong>shallow</strong> to travel by boat. Local officials have asked old people and pregnant women to move from communities by the river to the city center. This is because medical help may not be able to reach them.</p>
<p>The low water is also affecting food prices. Farmers who produce cassava flour cannot get it to market. As a result, this important Amazon food has more than doubled in price, local government says.</p>
<p>Another worry is fire. There were around 25,000 fires from January until late July — the highest number for this period in almost twenty years. In the Amazon, fires are mostly human-made. People use the fires to manage fields and clear areas where trees have been cut down.</p>
<p>Drought is not the only weather event affecting areas in Brazil's Acre state. Severe flooding hit 19 of the state's 22 communities last year.</p>
<p>“It's been two years <strong>in a row</strong> of extreme events,” said Julie Messias, Acre's secretary of environment. She added, “The result is that we are facing a threat of food shortage. First, the crops were flooded, and now the planting period is very dry.”</p>
<p>The Amazon is the world's largest river system, carrying 20 percent of the world's river water into the oceans each year.</p>

<p>A California wildlife organization says it has been rescuing sick sea lions in recent weeks showing signs of <strong>algae</strong> poisoning.</p>
<p>On August 1, the Santa Barbara-based Channel Islands Marine &amp; Wildlife Institute said teams had rescued at least 23 animals. The U.S. Vandenberg Space Force Base recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.facebook.com/SLD30/">released photos</a> on social media of sea lions being taken from one of its beaches.</p>
<p>The institute said that since July 26, it had received numerous reports daily of sick lions along a 250-kilometer stretch of coastline in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by the Channel Islands Marine &amp; Wildlife Institute (CIMWI) shows a sick sea lion on San Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura, California on July 29, 2024.

<p>The group said in a statement the sea creatures were found to be suffering from the effects of domoic acid, a poison that can harm the brain and heart. The release of the acid in a large ocean event is known as an algae <strong>bloom</strong>.</p>
<p>The poison is produced by microscopic algae eaten by shellfish or small fish. Those shellfish or fish are often then eaten by sea lions, dolphins or birds. The algae can also sicken humans.</p>
<p>Among the signs of sickness experienced by affected sea lions are unusual head movements, <strong>disorientation</strong>, foaming at the mouth and seizures.</p>
<p>In a message <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.facebook.com/CIMWI">published</a> on Facebook August 4, the institute said the poisoning event was “heating up,” with new cases of sick sea lions still appearing at multiple beaches. It explained that rescue teams first try to get the animals in a net so they can be transported for treatment and then returned to the sea.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says poisoning events linked to domoic acid are common along the California coast. Experts said the latest poisoning event seems to mostly be affecting adult female sea lions.</p>
<p>Last year, an especially severe poisoning event killed hundreds of sea lions and a number of dolphins during the first weeks of June.</p>

            <title>How a Small College Became a Top High-tech University (2024/8/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A measure begun 40 years ago by South Dakota lawmakers and state higher education leaders has turned a small rural college into one of the top high-tech universities in the United States.</p>
<p>It began at a time when the future of Dakota State College itself was in question.</p>
<p>In 1984, the South Dakota Board of Regents, which oversees the school, was under pressure to cut its budget. It closed one college and turned it into a prison.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="MadLabs research facility of Dakota State University is a hub for cyber research. (Bart Pfankuch / South Dakota News Watch)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-c0a8-0242-2ebd-08dcb2212e2d_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">MadLabs research facility of Dakota State University is a hub for cyber research. (Bart Pfankuch / South Dakota News Watch)</span></div>
<p>Soon after, a new law went into effect. The measure put technology at the center of all Dakota State's study programs.</p>
<p>The decision to reinvent a teacher's college founded in 1881 in a rural city of 6,000 people seemed risky. But, at around the same time, Citibank, a major financial services company, decided to headquarter its credit card business in Sioux Falls, a city near the college.</p>
<p>José-Marie Griffiths is the current president of Dakota State University (DSU). The school changed its name from college to university in 1989.</p>
<p>Griffiths said Citibank was looking for computer programmers, and “somebody came up with the idea that, well, we could turn this college that's <strong>fumbling</strong> a little bit into a computer school with software development and engineering.”</p>
<p>Griffiths told <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sdnewswatch.org/dakota-state-university-madison-cybsersecurity-program-growth/">South Dakota News Watch</a>, “That way, we could supply the needed programmers to the Sioux Falls workforce for Citibank and <strong>ultimately</strong> for others....”</p>
<p><strong>Change was not fully supported at first</strong></p>
<p>Lynette Molstad Gorder was teaching at DSU 40 years ago when the change to a high-tech campus began. She said, at first, some members of the college community were unsure about the change, and its effect on people and programs.</p>
<p>“Later on we looked upon it as a welcome opportunity,” she said. “It was kind of hazy (at first) and then all of a sudden, it just clicked.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, computers replaced pens, pencils and typewriters in classrooms. And later, the move into computer science and then cyber security, she said.</p>
<p>The jump into technology at DSU started with a bachelor's degree in computer science using teaching materials from IBM. The teaching of computer science and software development along with industry partnership laid the groundwork for what was to come, Griffiths said.</p>
<p>With a mix of private and public money, the university expanded the school and its offerings.</p>
<p>In 2004, the National Security Agency named DSU a Center of Academic Excellence in computer security, one of the first in the nation.</p>
<p>The number of students has also risen steadily, from 867 in 1985 to 3,509 in 2023. The university said DSU now offers 44 degrees, including seven master's degrees and four doctoral programs.</p>
<p>In 2017, DSU started Madison Cyber Labs with money from the state and local businesses. It expanded research at the university to include cyber security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, among others.</p>
<p>The school is now planning an expansion into Sioux Falls itself. The plan includes partnerships with another research center and a cyber academy program for high school students.</p>
<p>DSU is also pushing the state for more money to start a new center for quantum computing.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities for DSU graduates</strong></p>
<p>Jen Easterly is director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She was the lead speaker at a DSU cybersecurity event last March.</p>
<p>Easterly said that before she visited Madison, she had been hearing increasing discussion on the national level about the growth and<strong> innovation</strong> taking place at DSU.</p>
<p>She said, “The ideas generated at forums like this are just further proof that it doesn't matter the size of the university. ...”</p>
<p>Alexis Kulm graduated from DSU in December of 2022. She studied cyber operations there.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old said she liked the small-town feel of the college. She took classes in web and network design, computer programming and malware analysis. All of them, she said, helped prepare her for the cyber workplace.</p>
<p>“You get a strong real-world education in your classes,” Kulm said.</p>
<p>Kulm also said she had several job offers after graduating. She chose Sanford Health, a company in Sioux Falls. It has a partnership with the university to increase employment opportunities for DSU graduates.</p>
<p>Kulm is not the only DSU graduate to stay in South Dakota. Jon Waldman and Chad Knutson were in the class of 2006. Soon after graduating, they set up a business together right in Madison. Their 90-employee company SBS CyberSecurity serves the banking industry in 49 states.</p>
<p>Waldman said DSU has “a commitment to innovation” that makes it easy for students to remain on top of the always-changing cyber technology and security industry.</p>

<p>Scientists now have an explanation for the mysterious remains of an ancient Egyptian woman who has her mouth open in what appears to be a <strong>scream</strong>.</p>
<p>Scientists used a special computer aided X-ray, or CT scan, of the woman's body. What they found suggested that the so-called "Screaming Woman" <strong>mummy</strong> may have died in pain and experienced a form of muscular hardening known as a cadaveric <strong>spasm</strong>. This rare kind of spasm happens at the moment of death.</p>
<p>The examination found that the woman was about 48 years old when she died. Cairo University's Sahar Saleem said she had lived with mild <strong>arthritis</strong> of the spine and had lost some teeth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The face of the " at="" august="" cairo="" egypt="" egyptian="" handout="" in="" is="" january="" mummy="" museum="" on="" photograph="" released="" reuters="" saleem="" screaming="" seen="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/cb26197c-2c9a-434c-bca9-88d379eca2ed_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" the="" this="" via="" woman=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The face of the "Screaming Woman" mummy is seen at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt, January 18, 2023 in this handout photograph released on August 2, 2024. (Sahar Saleem/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>Saleem led the study that appeared recently in the publication Frontiers in Medicine.</p>
<p>The woman's body was well-<strong>preserved</strong> although it had been <strong>embalmed</strong> 3,500 years ago. Embalmers used costly imported materials such as juniper oil and frankincense resin, Saleem added.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians considered preservation of the body after death important for securing a good existence in the afterlife. It was a custom to remove the internal organs during the mummification process. But the organ removals had not taken place with this woman.</p>
<p>Saleem said, "In ancient Egypt, the embalmers took care of the dead body, so it would look beautiful for the afterlife.”</p>
<p>She explained that embalmers were interested in closing the mouth of the dead. Embalmers kept the <strong>jaw</strong> in place by tying the jaw to the head. This prevented the normal jaw drop that occurs after death.</p>
<p>But the embalmers were likely not careless with the so-called “Screaming Woman.” They used high quality materials and gave her costly jewelry and a wig, Saleem said.</p>
<p>She added that this evidence "opened the way to other explanations of the widely opened mouth.”</p>
<p>The woman may have died screaming from pain. And the muscles of the face may have become tense to preserve this appearance “at the time of death due to cadaveric spasm," Saleem explained.</p>
<p>She said that the full history of the woman's death is unknown, adding the cause of her facial appearance cannot be known “with certainty."</p>
<p>Cadaveric spasm is a poorly understood condition. It is thought to happen after severe physical or emotional suffering. The <strong>contracted</strong> facial muscles become tense and unmoving immediately following death.</p>
<p>Saleem explained that unlike the stiffening of muscles and joints that happens after death - "cadaveric spasm affects only one group of muscles, not the entire body."</p>
<p>Asked whether the woman may have been embalmed while alive, Saleem added, "I don't believe that this is possible."</p>
<p>Saleem was unable to find out how the woman died.</p>
<p>The "Screaming Woman" was found in the ancient city of Thebes during a scientific search of the burial of a high-ranking official named Senmut in 1935.</p>
<p>The mummy was inside a wooden <strong>coffin</strong> in a room beneath Senmut's family burial area. Her identity is unknown, but her costly jewelry shows her important position.</p>
<p>"She was likely a close family member to be buried and share the family's<strong> eternal </strong>resting place," Saleem said.</p>

            <title>Study: Twice-yearly Injections Cut HIV Infections by 100 Percent (2024/8/6)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>A new study has found that the twice-yearly injections of a treatment for AIDS were 100 percent effective in preventing new HIV infections in women.</p>
<p>The U.S. drugmaker Gilead sells the drug treatment under the name Sunlenca. The drug is approved in the United States, Canada, Europe and in other places, but only as a treatment for HIV.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A pharmacist holds a vial of lenacapavir, the new HIV prevention injectable drug, at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation's Masiphumelele Research Site, in Cape Town, South Africa, July 23, 2024.

<p>The researchers ended the study early because of the surprisingly good results. All the people in the study were then offered the injection, or shot, also known as lenacapavir.</p>
<p>Thandeka Nkosi helped run the Gilead research at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Masiphumelele, South Africa. She said the idea of a twice-a-year shot is “quite revolutionary news.”</p>
<p>About 5,300 young women and girls in South Africa and Uganda took part in the study. Researchers reported that none of the women injected with the treatment became infected with HIV. Among those given daily prevention pills, about two percent became infected with HIV from infected sex partners.</p>
<p>Gilead said it is waiting for results of testing in men before seeking permission<strong> </strong>to use it as protection against HIV.</p>
<p>The <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> published the results on July 24. Experts also discussed the study at an AIDS conference in Munich, Germany. Gilead paid for the study and some of the researchers are company employees.</p>
<p>There are other ways to prevent HIV infection. These include devices like condoms or drugs taken daily by mouth. However, regular use has been a problem in Africa. In the new study, only about 30 percent of people given Gilead's Truvada or Descovy HIV prevention pills actually took them. That percentage also dropped over time.</p>
<p>Nkosi said the twice-yearly injections give people a choice. She added that injections took away the “<strong>stigma</strong> around taking pills” to prevent HIV.</p>
<p><strong>High cost of the drug</strong></p>
<p>As an HIV treatment, the drug costs more than $40,000 a year in the U.S. Health insurance companies pay part of the cost and patients pay the balance.</p>
<p>People working to stop the spread of AIDS are interested in the Sunlenca shots. But they are concerned that Gilead has not agreed on a lower price for those who need the shots the most.</p>
<p>“Gilead has a tool that could change the <strong>trajectory</strong> of the HIV <strong>epidemic</strong>,” said Winnie Byanyima. She is executive director of the Geneva-based UNAIDS.</p>
<p>She said the U.N. AIDS agency urged Gilead to share Sunlenca's <strong>patent </strong>with a U.N. program. The program's goal is to let <strong>generic </strong>drugmakers manufacture low-cost versions of drugs for poor countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Helen Bygrave of Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the injections could “reverse the epidemic if it is made available in the countries with the highest rate of new infections.” She urged Gilead to publish a lower price for Sunlenca that all countries could pay.</p>
<p>In other research presented at the AIDS conference, Andrew Hill of the University of Liverpool and others said the drug's price would go down. They estimated that once production of Sunlenca is expanded to treat 10 million people, the price would fall to about $40 per treatment.</p>
<p>He said it was important for health officials to get Sunlenca as soon as possible. “This is about as close as you can get to an HIV vaccine,” Hill said.</p>
<p>Gilead said it would seek a “voluntary <strong>licensing</strong> program.” It said a small number of generic producers would be permitted to make the drug.</p>
<p>In a statement last month, Gilead said it was too early to say how much Sunlenca would cost in poorer countries. Dr. Jared Baeten is a product development official with Gilead. He said the company was already talking to generic drugmakers and understood how “deeply important it is that we move at speed.”</p>
<p>Byanyima said many groups need long-lasting protection from HIV infection. They include women and girls who are victims of violence and <strong>homosexual</strong> men in countries where homosexuality is criminalized.</p>
<p>UNAIDS says that in 2022 46 percent of new HIV infections in the world were in women and girls. In Africa, females are three times more likely to get HIV than males, the U.N. group said.</p>
<p>Recently, UNAIDS released a report on the state of the HIV epidemic. It said that fewer people were infected with HIV in 2023 than at any time since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The U.N. says HIV infects about 1.3 million people every year and kills more than 600,000, mainly in Africa. While much progress has been made in Africa, HIV infections are rising in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.</p>

            <title>NASA Rover Captures Rock Showing Possible Signs of Microbial Life (2024/8/5)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A Mars explorer operated by the American space agency NASA has captured a rock that scientists say shows possible signs of ancient microbial life.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-perseverance-rover-scientists-find-intriguing-mars-rock">said</a> in a recent statement that the Perseverance explorer, or rover, collected the rock on July 21. Scientists working on the Perseverance team <strong>nicknamed</strong> the rock “Cheyava Falls,” after the tallest waterfall in the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>The rover's exploration area is believed to include a former river valley measuring about 400 meters wide. The valley is thought to have formed by water rushing into Jezero <strong>Crater</strong> billions of years ago. Scientists believe the area around Jezero Crater contained large bodies of water in the distant past.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="NASA's Perseverance rover made several new discoveries the space agency says support existing evidence that ancient microbial life may have lived on Mars when the planet had running water.

<p>NASA's statement says the rock shows signs of “chemical <strong>signatures</strong> and structures that could possibly have been formed by life billions of years ago...”</p>
<p>NASA team members based their findings on examinations of the rock with imaging equipment and multiple scientific instruments. But they noted that additional research is needed to confirm a history of microbial life.</p>
<p>The examinations did suggest the rock contains “organic compounds,” NASA said. But the statement added, “While such carbon-based molecules are considered the building blocks of life, they also can be formed by non-biological processes.”</p>
<p>Perseverance uses its robotic arm and <strong>drilling</strong> equipment to capture rock and soil <strong>samples</strong> from the Martian surface. So far, it has collected 22 samples. The rover has secured the samples in special containers and they are to be picked up and returned to Earth during a future mission.</p>
<p>Ken Farley is a project scientist with the Perseverance team at Caltech in Pasadena, California. He said, “Cheyava Falls is the most <strong>puzzling</strong>, complex, and potentially important rock yet investigated by Perseverance.”</p>
<p>Farley said unusual color spots and other structural elements in the samples suggest “chemical reactions” that might have given energy to ancient microbial life. But he noted that so far, scientists have not been able to identify exactly how the rock formed.</p>
<p>The team described the rock as containing white <strong>veins</strong> that may have been created by the substance calcium sulfate. Between the veins, examiners found lines of material with a reddish color. These lines suggest the presence of hematite, a common substance found in many rocks on Earth.</p>
<p>David Flannery is an astrobiologist and member of the Perseverance science team from the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. He said that on Earth, these kinds of rock elements are often linked “with the <strong>fossilized</strong> record of microbes living in the subsurface."</p>
<p>The scientists said the new findings strengthen existing evidence that such rocks may have been created or were changed by flowing water on Mars billions of years ago.</p>
<p>Caltech's Farley said the rock sample had already been imaged and examined with lasers, X-ray equipment and other instruments as much as possible in recent weeks. He noted that Perseverance has done as much as it can to examine the newly discovered samples.</p>
<p>Farley added, “To fully understand what really happened in that Martian river valley at Jezero Crater billions of years ago, we'd want to bring the Cheyava Falls sample back to Earth.” That way, he said, “it can be studied with the powerful instruments available in laboratories.”</p>
