        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Is the Pink Substance Dropped on LA Fires Safe?  (2025/1/30)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">29 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>The efforts to battle widespread fires across Los Angeles included aircraft drops of a bright red and pink substance.</p>
<p>The material covered forests, homes, cars, and other things in the path of the wind-fueled fires. Because the substance was dropped in many <strong>residential</strong> areas, some people have wondered how safe it is.</p>
<p>The material is a fire <strong>retardant</strong>. The kind dropped around Los Angeles was mostly a product called Phos-Chek. The substance has been used by the U.S. Forest Service to fight fires since the 1960s.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An air tanker drops retardant while working to contain the Eaton Fire in Altadena, Calif., Monday, Jan. 13, 2025." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1bebe65d-a252-4781-8b96-0678d9f00565_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An air tanker drops retardant while working to contain the Eaton Fire in Altadena, Calif., Monday, Jan. 13, 2025.</span></div>
<p>Jason Colquhoun is a 53-year-old pilot with HeliQwest, an aircraft company specializing in firefighting activities. He told the French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that using the Barbie-pink material makes his job easier. "You can see it so easily ... it's <strong>amazing</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Daniel McCurry is an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. He said that in recent weeks, Phos-Chek had been dropped in residential areas more than ever before. That fact has led many to question its safety.</p>
<p>Phos-Chek is sold by fire protection equipment supplier Perimeter Solutions. It is a mixture of mostly ammonium phosphate or ammonium polyphosphate. These substances are also used to produce fertilizer. Other chemicals are added to the mixture to give it color. Perimeter told AFP the substance is designed to be one color. But it can look different depending on time of day, lighting, or smoke.</p>
<p>The bright pink color helps pilots as they try to make sure they have covered a whole area, Colquhoun explained. He noted that when pilots drop water from the air, they have to search for "the shine and the darkness" to know where to make the next drop. The colorful retardant, however, is "so much easier to spot," Colquhoun said.</p>
<p>McCurry said another reason it is better than water is that it keeps working even after the water it is mixed with dries. Phos-Chek is made thick so the wind does not blow it away and to ensure that it covers the desired area.</p>
<p>McCurry explained the substance works by forming a <strong>coating</strong> that will not burn. After the water dries up, the retardant keeps working until rain washes it into the ground. McCurry said a former firefighter told him that in a high-intensity fire the substance is "not much use." He added that the high winds driving the fires in Los Angeles may have limited its effectiveness.</p>
<p>U.S. Forest Service spokesperson Wade Muehlhof said the agency only uses retardants that meet U.S. government rules for not being harmful to animals, humans, or things living in water. He told AFP the Forest Service usually does not drop the retardant in waterways and areas home to endangered animals -- unless the fire is threatening human life or public safety. But accidents do happen, he said, and the wind may blow it into such areas.</p>
<p>McCurry said he believes Phos-Chek is “likely not harmless to the environment” now. But, he added, "On the other hand, the human health <strong>impact</strong> is still a little unclear." He noted that it would take "a lot" of retardant to poison, say, a large body of water.</p>
<p>But he said that as firefighters battled the Los Angeles fires, the substance was dropped on a lot of neighborhoods in “<strong>unprecedented</strong>”<strong> </strong>amounts. McCurry said Phos-Chek is more often used further from populated areas, or in lesser amounts. "So, who knows," he added.</p>

            <title>Scientists with Disabilities Seek Changes to Improve their Work  (2025/1/29)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/scientists-with-disabilities-seek-changes-to-improve-their-work.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Mario Ritter, Jr.</span><br/>
<span class="datetime">28 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Disabled researchers often face barriers while carrying out their work. So some scientists with disabilities are seeking to increase attention about the problem and come up with workable solutions.</p>
<p>Anita Marshall is a geologist with the University of Florida. She recently told The Associated Press (AP) that while she faces some limitations, it does not mean she cannot do her job. “Just because you can't do it like someone else doesn't mean you can't do it,” she said.</p>
<p>Marshall recently led an outing of disabled researchers to a natural lake in Southern California's San Bernadino National Forest.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Taormina Lepore, foreground, who has low vision, walks with a white cane during the accessible field trip Sept. 26, 2024, in San Bernadino, Calif. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/52f9daf9-6d6d-40df-8faa-0fd4f56d6862_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">Taormina Lepore, foreground, who has low vision, walks with a white cane during the accessible field trip Sept. 26, 2024, in San Bernadino, Calif. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)</span></div>
<p>The group included scientists and students with disabilities related to sight, hearing and mobility. They visited Lost Lake, which sits along the area's San Andreas Fault. The fault contains two <strong>tectonic plates</strong> that can cause earthquakes.</p>
<p>The trip was organized by Marshall's group, called the International Association for Geoscience Diversity. It aims to demonstrate the difficulties, or challenges, disabled researchers often face. Other groups also aim to improve <strong>access </strong>to field and laboratory work so those with disabilities feel welcome and stay.</p>
<p>Taormina Lepore is a Western Michigan University paleontologist who went on the trip. She told the AP that one problem is that many scientists seem to value a single, traditional way of doing their work. This makes it more difficult to get changes for disabled researchers.</p>
<p>On the trip to Lost Lake, everyone got to see the lake even if they could not get there physically. Some attendees saw the surroundings on video taken by a drone.</p>
<p>Lepore, who also researches science education, said an important part of the process is for scientists to think about what might help other scientists they work with. “It's really about <strong>empathy</strong>, as much as it is about science.”</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation said in 2021 that disabled people make up about three percent of the science, technology, engineering, and math workforce.</p>
<p>Scientists with disabilities say the low percentage is partly because labs, classrooms and field areas are not designed for disabled individuals.</p>
<p>Mark Leddy used to oversee disability-related <strong>grants </strong>for the National Science Foundation. He noted that some students and <strong>faculty </strong>are still told they cannot work in a lab or do research safely.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 does set rules for new buildings and labs. These include requiring <strong>ramps </strong>and walkways that can be used by people in wheelchairs. But making changes to older labs can be costly and difficult.</p>
<p>Alyssa Paparella is working on her doctorate degree in biology at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. She founded an online community for disabled scientists. Paparella said a science building at one of her former schools did not have the needed buttons to open the doors. “That's the front door that they're not even able to get in.”</p>
<p>Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives — a problem-solving skill that is needed in a lab.</p>
<p>Jennifer Piatek is a professor of Earth and Space Sciences at Central Connecticut State University. She uses a wheelchair but was able to see through drone video.</p>
<p>Piatek said it was nice to be part of a community that took her needs into account. You can learn a lot from images and maps, “but really you need to get to the space to be in it.”</p>
<p>Western Michigan's Lepore is a <strong>neurodivergent</strong> person with low vision. She noted, “Nature is not <strong>inherently </strong>accessible.”</p>
<p>Bushra Hussaini works at New York City's American Museum of Natural History. She told the AP that by going on field trips, she learns new ways to support <strong>interns </strong>and volunteers who visit the museum. She said the supportive community of geologists is what keeps her coming back. “We learn from each other and we help each other.”</p>
<p>As a doctoral student, Marshall went on field trips with other students. But she often had to wait in the car because the organizers had not thought about her disabilities. Marshall wants things to be different for the next generation of scientists. “The whole point of these little day trips is to just plant that seed out there...that there's another way forward,” she said.</p>

            <title>How to Protect Against Increased Viral Spread in Winter  (2025/1/28)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Caty Weaver</span><br/><span class="datetime">27 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Influenza, or the flu, COVID-19, norovirus and the common cold easily spread throughout the winter season.</p>
<p>Knowing what these infections are and how they spread can help us avoid them. The Associated Press has listed some things anyone can do to keep healthy and to know more about these infections:</p>
<p><strong>Cold, flu, or COVID?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1b9b0c9f-5a06-4670-aadc-dd16870c7d70_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon, File)</span></div>
<p>Some signs, or symptoms, of a cold, the flu, COVID-19 or norovirus are similar. This can make it hard to know what is making us sick.</p>
<p>However, some symptoms are unmistakable.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html">Norovirus</a> spreads through polluted food, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_QgPoTeZo">water</a> and surfaces, including the skin. The virus causes <strong>vomiting</strong>, <strong>diarrhea</strong>, and stomach pain. The sickness can last for about one to three days.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html">common cold</a> can be caused by several different kinds of viruses and can include several symptoms. These include a runny nose, <strong>congestion</strong>, <strong>cough</strong>, <strong>sneezing</strong>, and pain in the throat, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_VBZd1fld">head</a> and other parts of the body. It can also cause higher than normal body temperature, or a fever. The common cold usually lasts less than a week.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html">flu</a> is caused by influenza viruses that are always changing. Infection leads to fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body <strong>aches</strong>, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms usually hit more quickly than cold symptoms. They can last from a few days to two weeks.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html">COVID-19</a> can cause fever, <strong>chills</strong>, cough, congestion, tiredness and throat and head pain. Other signs of COVID are the loss of smell or taste, difficulty breathing, nausea, or vomiting. The sickness can last for several days.</p>
<p>The respiratory syncytial virus, or <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/symptoms/index.html">RSV</a>, can make people sick for one or two weeks. The signs include runny nose, congestion, coughing, sneezing, breathing problems, fever, and a loss of <strong>appetite</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wash your hands</strong></p>
<p>So how can we avoid infections? Experts say people should wash their hands carefully and often with a cleanser such as soap. Clean hands are very important to reducing the spread of norovirus, colds, flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says this is especially true after using the bathroom, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_vYnFPopf">eating</a> or preparing food.</p>
<p>Make sure you take enough time to wash your hands. It should take at least 20 seconds to complete the job.</p>
<p>If you do not have soap and water available, cleansers called hand sanitizers are a good substitute. The sanitizer must be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective against most of these viruses. An exception is norovirus which requires a stronger sanitizer.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning surfaces can remove viruses</strong></p>
<p>To avoid norovirus, you must immediately clean surfaces that have come in contact with infected food or bodily fluids. The CDC advises disinfecting things with a chlorine bleach solution or <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/epas-registered-antimicrobial-products-effective-against-norovirus-feline">one of the products listed on the Environmental Protection Agency website</a>.</p>
<p>Do not forget to wash any clothing that has come in contact with vomit or other bodily waste. Use hot water and soap. Then, wash your hands again.</p>
<p>With colds and flu, it is best to repeatedly clean surfaces that are touched or used often. These include doorknobs, light switches, kitchen workspaces, children's playthings, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_BaPXCDc6">cellphones</a> and other objects around the home.</p>
<p>Use household cleaning products that contain soap or detergent and follow up with a sanitizer. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html#:~:text=Clean%20first%20and%20clean%20regularly,viruses%20or%20bacteria%20from%20surfaces.">The CDC has more advice on how to clean</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air in small drops and particles. The CDC says there is low risk of getting the virus from surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your hands off your face can keep viruses out</strong></p>
<p>Viruses can spread through talking, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_98beP7cn">coughing</a> and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Then, wash your hands.</p>
<p>Do not touch your face. If you have viruses on your unwashed hands and touch your face, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_NHfUg1Ij">eyes</a> or nose, they can get into your body. Your likelihood of getting sick will increase.</p>
<p><strong>Consider a vaccine (if there is one)</strong></p>
<p>You might consider a vaccine if one is available.</p>
<p>Updated COVID-19 vaccines are available. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-flu-rsv-vaccines-shots-ad33f4fe23f4c293ab87415b6449d9ad">Yearly flu shots</a> for people 6 months and older are also available. For adults 60 and older or people who are pregnant, you might want to get the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/prevention.html">RSV vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine for norovirus or the common cold.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to keep your defenses against viruses up: Rest</strong></p>
<p>Your immune system may not work as well if you are lacking enough sleep, water or are experiencing high levels of tension. Rest. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://apnews.com/article/sleep-stress-anxiety-caffeine-alcohol-35dfa5725a0fdefae0b18d5442e55cb3">Sleep</a>. And drink enough water.</p>
<p><strong>Stay at home</strong></p>
<p>If you do get sick, you can take a test to find out if you have COVID-19 or influenza. It is important to know if you have a virus that could be treated with available medicines. The drug Paxlovid treats COVID-19. Tamiflu is used to treat flu.</p>
<p>Above all, if you have symptoms of any of these sicknesses, stay at home and away from other people. This will help stop the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain medicine to lower a fever or to ease pain. Humidifier machines, which increase the amount of water in the air, can also help ease symptoms.</p>
<p>There is no medication for norovirus. You need to replace fluids lost because of <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_Y8uzUGms">the sickness</a>. Drink as much water and other liquids as possible. Seek medical help if you notice you have a dry mouth and throat, are not expelling liquid waste easily, or feel <strong>dizzy</strong> when standing.</p>

            <title>Using Real Trees to Bring Nature Indoors  (2025/1/28)</title>

<p>There is a growing movement worldwide to use plants in building design to establish closer connections with nature and soften hard city <strong>styles</strong>. The movement also seeks to improve designs to help protect the environment and increase personal wellness.</p>
<p>Many of the efforts by <strong>architects</strong> and designers have centered on one natural element: trees.</p>
<p>Examples of such design can be found in many places, including New York City. A building in Manhattan that houses the Ford Foundation has a 12-story light-filled entrance area, or atrium. It is also filled with plants and flowers including magnolias, eucalyptus, jacaranda, cryptomeria, iron bark and pear trees.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by KAA Design Group shows the Tree House's primary suite private courtyard with Japanese wood soaking tub and reflecting pool.

<p>Another example sits within New York City's Brookfield Place shopping center. The center's main atrium includes a collection of 12-meter-tall Washingtonia palm trees.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the city-state's Jewel Changi airport offers travelers an inviting environment. It has 2,500 trees native to nations including Madagascar, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia. The airport includes a 2.4-hectare indoor forest with walking paths.</p>
<p>Some <strong>apartments</strong> and mixed-use buildings are also putting trees and other greenery into their designs. Such buildings are sometimes called “greenscrapers,” a term that comes from the word “<strong>skyscraper.”</strong></p>
<p>In Milan, Italy, architect Stefano Boeri designed Bosco Verticale, a 44-story building with 800 trees and other greenery. In the Netherlands, he also built the Trudo Vertical Forest. This is a low-income apartment building with trees growing on all sides.</p>
<p>Similar changes are also happening inside private homes. In some, trees are brought right indoors. In others, outdoor trees are carefully placed as important partners in the building plan.</p>
<p>Some architects even build homes around existing trees. Others plant one or more trees inside the home. And some architects or designers imagine natural settings indoors by using parts of trees. These designs are meant to create the look and feel of real wood, while bringing feelings of peace and calm.</p>
<p><strong>A calm heart of the home</strong></p>
<p>Ryoko Okada is an architect at New York City's Oda Architecture. She told The Associated Press that she and her co-workers aim to bring outdoor elements indoors as often as they can.</p>
<p>“There's nothing more calming than being surrounded by nature...” Okada said. She added that a living tree indoors can bring peace and happiness as people watch it grow and change.</p>
<p><strong>Framing the views with existing trees</strong></p>
<p>Another design example came from KAA Design Group in Los Angeles. A team from the company created a modern home that uses the property's existing trees, such as cork oaks, rare Torrey pines, and magnolias.</p>
<p>One very large, old cork oak sits in the center of the property. At first, the owners did not like the look and said they wanted the tree gone. One of the company's partners, Grant Kirkpatrick, had to persuade the homeowners to keep it. Kirkpatrick explained he succeeded by pointing out that the tree was “a 300-year-old <strong>antique</strong> that should be <strong>featured </strong>rather than removed.”</p>
<p>The driveway on that property also offers a calming design. A black pine tree rises up from the driveway like a piece of natural art. In addition, views from almost every window in the house feature the beautiful nature outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Things to consider</strong></p>
<p>Okada says she suggests people do not plant a full-size tree in their home without first seeking expert advice. She notes that a living tree will only do well if certain conditions – such as air, light and soil – are right.</p>
<p>Okada added that a living tree “...needs to be supported by proper <strong>infrastructure</strong> to stay alive and avoid home damage.” She also urges people to heavily research a tree's natural environment to avoid drawing in unwanted <strong>pests</strong>.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick noted that planting a tree indoors can be difficult. He explained that at least 1.2 meters of soil depth is needed, along with lots of natural light and the right temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to use trees besides having a live one</strong></p>
<p>Kirkpatrick said he worked on one property that experienced a serious fire in 2016. His team decided to use parts from one of the burned manzanita trees in the interior design. The piece was painted black and placed inside the property. He said it now represents an eye-catching, natural art piece.</p>

            <title>The American South Gets ‘Once-in-a Lifetime’ Snow and Cold  (2025/1/28)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/the-american-south-gets-once-in-a-lifetime-snow-and-cold.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">27 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>People in the southern U.S. state of Florida are used to warm, sunny weather. But on January 21, Floridians saw a rare sight: snow on their beaches. A cold weather system brought snow to several southern states in what many are calling a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p>
<p>So much snow fell across the American South that snowballs flew on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, and children and parents used any kind of plastic they could find to slide down snow-covered hills along the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that 24.9 centimeters of snow fell near the small town of Milton, Florida. That breaks the snowfall record of 10.1 centimeters from 1954.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An ice covered fountain sits in front of a Mardi Gras festooned skeleton the day after a rare and record setting snowstorm in River Ridge, La., a suburb of New Orleans, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f02d36d4-0a04-4a0e-8af1-7b62d1203c79_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An ice covered fountain sits in front of a Mardi Gras festooned skeleton the day after a rare and record setting snowstorm in River Ridge, La., a suburb of New Orleans, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. </span></div>
<p>"It's an incredible, incredible event," said Michael Mugrage. Mugrage is a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Mobile, Alabama. That is where many of the highest snowfall numbers from the South were reported. "It puts it in <strong>perspective</strong> how rare this is."</p>
<p>Milton is northeast of Pensacola, Florida, where 22.6 centimeters broke the city's previous all-time snow record of 7.6 centimeters set in 1895.</p>
<p>Here are some places reporting rare snowfall events:</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans, Louisiana</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Service reported that in some parts of New Orleans, 25 centimeters of snow fell. That broke the city's record of 6.8 centimeters from 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Houston, Texas</strong></p>
<p>In Texas, up to 10 centimeters of snow fell in the Houston area. The area reportedly does not own any trucks with snow-moving equipment known as snowplows.</p>
<p><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong></p>
<p>More than 10 centimeters of snow fell in and around Charleston, South Carolina, where snow closed the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile, Alabama</strong></p>
<p>At Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama, 15.7 centimeters of snow was recorded, breaking the city's one-day snowfall record of 12.7 centimeters. The record was set on January 24, 1881, the weather service said. A reported snowfall total of 28 centimeters in the small town of Babbie in southern Alabama was among the highest nationwide for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and snowy</strong></p>
<p>It was very cold in Mobile, too. The National Weather Service said a low of <strong>minus</strong> 14 Celsius tied the third-coldest low temperature record for the city, set in 1899. In Louisiana, all-time records for low temperatures were reported in the cities of New Iberia and Lafayette. Wednesday's low of minus 17 Celsius in New Iberia broke a record that had stood since 1962. Lafayette's low of minus 16 Celsius broke a record that dates back to 1899.</p>
<p>Across several southern states, flights were cancelled, and some highways were closed.</p>
<p><strong>Europe's climate agency reports record high temperatures</strong></p>
<p>The record snowfall and low temperatures did not affect the entire world. The AP reports Europe's Copernicus climate service data shows the first 20 days of January 2025 had the highest average temperature worldwide recorded for the first 20 days of any year.</p>
<p>So far this year, U.S. weather has set or equaled 697 daily records for coldest temperatures. That is close to the 629 daily records that have been reported so far this year for warmest temperatures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in the past 365 days, U.S. weather stations have recorded five times as many heat records as cold records.</p>
<p>Scientists say they seem to be seeing more cool air but not cooler weather. Some scientists hold the theory that warm temperatures in the Arctic area are displacing cold air which is pushed further south.</p>

<p>Two American astronauts awaiting their return flight from the International Space Station (ISS) have stayed busy carrying out a series of scientific experiments.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency NASA has said the pair – Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams – will remain at the ISS until late March or early April. When they arrived at the orbiting laboratory in June 2024, the astronauts expected to stay in space for just one week.</p>
<p>Their trip was a test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. While Starliner safely transported the two to the ISS, the spacecraft had several problems that persuaded NASA to send it back to Earth for further testing without the astronauts onboard.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by NASA, Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Butch Wilmore, left, and Suni Williams pose inside the International Space Station's Harmony module and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 13, 2024.

(NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>NASA's current plan calls for Wilmore and Williams to fly back on a SpaceX spacecraft in late March at the earliest. NASA has been using SpaceX's Crew Dragon to regularly carry astronauts and supplies to the ISS since 2020.</p>
<p>The astronauts have been using their extended mission to carry out experiments. In addition, Williams stepped out of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/">the space station</a> earlier this month to complete a spacewalk.</p>
<p>Another NASA astronaut, Nick Hague, joined Williams on the spacewalk on January 16, the agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/suni-williams-conducts-spacewalk/#:~:text=NASA%20astronaut%20Suni%20Williams%20is,and%20the%20eighth%20for%20Williams.">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>The two repaired a piece of equipment that helps guide the movements of the ISS. The spacewalk also included work on an X-ray telescope, as well as maintenance activities for other ISS systems. NASA noted it was the fourth spacewalk for Hague and the eighth for Williams.</p>
<p>The space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/">said</a> Williams was preparing for another spacewalk planned for January 30. Wilmore is expected to join Williams on that spacewalk, which NASA estimates will last about six-and-a-half hours. The two will be aiming to remove <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_FkQDXp0z">a radio</a> <strong>antenna </strong>structure. They will also be “searching for microbes” around the ISS for use in experiments.</p>
<p>Here is a look at other experiments Wilmore and Williams have completed during their stay:</p>
<p><strong>New methods to grow food</strong></p>
<p>NASA said Wilmore and Williams have tested different methods for growing crops in space. Such methods could support humans who have longer stays in space in the future.</p>
<p>One experiment is called the Plant Water Management investigation. NASA said this experiment “uses the physical properties of fluids...to overcome the lack of gravity and provide <strong>hydration</strong> to plants.” The experiment aims to help NASA develop <strong>hydroponic</strong> systems to support future space missions.</p>
<p>Another experiment examines a new way to grow vegetables, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_4036MWWQ">plants</a> and flowers inside the ISS to provide nutrition and beauty. As part of this experiment, Wilmore <strong>installed</strong> a new light <strong>meter</strong> inside the ISS. The device is designed to measure available light and to help crew members improve growing operations.</p>
<p><strong>Robot assistants</strong></p>
<p>NASA also said that throughout the current mission, Williams had deployed and observed three free-flying robots called Astrobee. This robotic experiment seeks to examine how such robots could assist astronauts with daily duties and <strong>maintenance</strong> work.</p>
<p>The agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=1891">said</a> the square-shaped robots are designed to help scientists and engineers develop and test new robotic technologies for use in microgravity environments. The assistants are also designed to help astronauts with daily tasks “and give ground controllers additional eyes and ears on the space station.”</p>
<p>Williams tested the robots' ability to map the inside of the space station and Astrobee's flight abilities.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p><strong>Image captures from space</strong></p>
<p>NASA astronauts visiting the ISS have a long history of capturing images of Earth from space. And this is another activity Wilmore and Williams have carried out. The ISS gives astronauts a “window to the world” as they orbit 400 kilometers above their home planet.</p>
<p>During their mission, NASA said the two astronauts had “captured hundreds of photographs of Earth, ranging from <strong>auroras</strong>, land, sea, orbital sunrises and sunsets, and more.”</p>
<p><strong>Radio connections with Earth </strong></p>
<p>Another space station tradition is for U.S. astronauts to connect with students and other interested individuals during their stay in space. They have <strong>virtual</strong> visits with people back on Earth who can ask the astronauts how it feels to live in space and can learn about NASA's experiments aboard the ISS.</p>
<p>In early August, Williams used <strong>ham radio</strong> technology to connect with students from Banda Aceh, Indonesia. NASA explained that students get the chance to communicate with the astronauts when the ISS passes overhead. The students can ask about research on the ISS as well as the radio wave technology that makes <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_vqekhKzO">the communication</a> possible.</p>

<p>In flooded agricultural fields near the Tennessee River, tens of thousands of birds called sandhill cranes search for food such as berries, corn, seeds and insects.</p>
<p>The Cranes come to the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge Center in northern Alabama during the winter. The yearly movement, or migration, of sandhill cranes brings many birdwatchers who want to see the tall birds up close.</p>
<p>The birdwatchers also come to see the rare and endangered whooping cranes that migrate in much smaller numbers to Wheeler. Many other birds can be seen, including geese, ducks, bald eagles, kestrels and hawks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rob Broeren takes pictures of sandhill cranes at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Decatur, Ala. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c30c8162-eff9-46e9-80b1-895371d27902_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Rob Broeren takes pictures of sandhill cranes at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Decatur, Ala. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)</span></div>
<p>Park ranger David Young described the area as “a birder's paradise,” meaning it is a perfect place for birdwatchers.</p>
<p>The cranes fly from the Great Lakes, an area far to the north, to Alabama each year.</p>
<p>The sandhill cranes started migrating to Wheeler for the winter in the mid-1990s. Their numbers increased by a lot in the mid-2000s, Young said. Last year, the migratory sandhill population reached a new record of 30,000 cranes.</p>
<p>The refuge has become a popular place for birdwatchers who bring hand-held telescopes called binoculars. Birdwatchers can even get closer to the 1.2-meter-tall cranes as visitors stay hidden behind photography <strong>blinds</strong> and a two-level observation center. A yearly Festival of the Cranes in January brings more attention and visitors.</p>
<p>The cranes put on a fun show, dancing on their thin legs, moving their wings and putting their long beaks in the air to make different sounds.</p>
<p>Diana Maybury-Sharp regularly comes to Wheeler with friends to <strong>hike</strong> and look at birds.</p>
<p>“It's pretty<strong> extraordinary</strong>. I've seen them in other parts of the country where there were just a few,” Maybury-Sharp said. “They're not<strong> vocal</strong> like they are here. There's so many here that it's an unusual experience.”</p>
<p>The whooping cranes are part of the eastern migratory population that comes from the north-central state of Wisconsin. Young said they started coming to Alabama in 2004. Their population is between 12 and 20 each winter.</p>
<p>Whooping cranes nearly died out in the early 1900s because of hunting and farming. The International Crane Foundation says recovery and reintroduction efforts have slowly increased their wild and captive populations to more than 800.</p>
<p>The whooping cranes are sometimes hard to see among the sandhills, but their height and white feathers help them stand out. Young said the migration patterns of the cranes might change depending on the climate of both their <strong>nesting </strong>places to the north and their winter homes in the south.</p>
<p>Rob Broeren brought along his camera and a long telephoto lens and found a good place to work on his wildlife photography skills. He comes to the refuge about twice a month each year to photograph the birds and ducks.</p>
<p>“You just need to be patient and wait for them to do something interesting and make their calls,” Broeren said. “You get that cool shot and that's a good day.”</p>
<p>The sandhill cranes will start leaving the refuge in mid-February. Young said he notices a lot more activity when the birds are showing they are ready to travel back to their nesting grounds.</p>
<p>“It's usually on a day when we have some sort of a south wind," Young said. "They're smart and they will ride the wind back to their breeding grounds whenever it's most <strong>convenient</strong> for them.”</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, winter brings cold temperatures and, in some places, snowfall. For people who like planting things, gardening may seem far away.</p>
<p>However, during winter weather, there are still things a gardener can do to prepare for the spring. Gardening expert Jessica Damiano recently wrote about such preparatory <strong>tasks</strong> for the Associated Press. We can also call these tasks "prep work."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Snow covers the yard of a home in the Grant Park neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, Feburary 23, 2023.

<p><strong>Testing seeds</strong></p>
<p>First let's talk about seeds.</p>
<p>If you have seed <strong>packets</strong>, she suggests checking their <strong>expiration</strong> date. That is the date by which they go “bad” or will not grow. Damiano says the seeds are usually considered “fresh” within a year of being <strong>packaged</strong>. But they can be used for longer than that.</p>
<p>However, you cannot be sure if the seeds are still good just by looking at a date. She suggests testing them.</p>
<p>To do this, she places several seeds on a wet paper towel and then puts that into a plastic container. In about 10 days, she will look to see how many seeds have <strong>sprouted. </strong></p>
<p>This gives her an idea of how many seeds to use to get the desired number of plants. However, if less than 50 percent of the seeds sprout, she throws them away.</p>
<p>Damiano tests her old seeds in the winter before the busy spring gardening season. That is when seed and plant stores, or nurseries, can run out of seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Inspect and care for equipment</strong></p>
<p>She also inspects her gardening equipment.</p>
<p>For example, if you use grow lights — lights especially made for plants — make sure they still work. You might have to buy new <strong>bulbs</strong>.</p>
<p>Damiano brings out her grow lights and inspects each bulb. If necessary, she will order replacement bulbs. That way she is prepared to plant at any time, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_xunw7UCS">even</a> six to eight weeks in the future.</p>
<p>She also makes sure she has <strong>sterile</strong> seed-starting potting mix. This is special soil for planting in containers.</p>
<p>Damiano sharpens her cutting tools, such as pruning shears. Larger tools like lawnmowers should be inspected every year. Like nurseries, places that service lawn equipment might be busier in the spring. You can get ahead of the crowd by getting your tools fixed early.</p>
<p>Clean your gardening hand tools, like trowels and spades. Cover them lightly with oil. This will help keep them in good working order.</p>
<p>Inspect things like hoses, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_cHp8ajPN">sprinklers</a> and other water systems for damage. Make a list of anything you may need to replace or repair.</p>
<p>Damiano says that you could wait until spring to take care of all these things—but why? Once spring arrives, you will have these tasks done.</p>
<p>And that's the Health &amp; Lifestyle report. I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about our busy lives. Many people have family and work responsibilities. We might have religious or community activities. Taking care of our health is also important. And let's not forget about our personal projects, our interests, and our friendships.</p>
<p>With everything <u>on our plate</u>, it is easy to feel <strong>overwhelmed</strong>, overextended, and <strong>overcommitted</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="During the coronavirus pandemic, many resources were spread very thin.

<p>However, if we try to do too much, we may <u>spread ourselves too thin</u>. This expression means we have taken on too much. We are <u>pushed to the limit</u>.</p>
<p>People who are<u> spread too thin</u>, take on too many jobs, projects, or goals. The heavy load requires more energy or attention than they possess.</p>
<p>If we work on many projects simultaneously, or at the same time, it is possible that none will get done well, if they get done at all. And it is possible such <strong>multitasking</strong> could <strong>stress </strong>us out.</p>
<p>Being spread too thin can also be described as <u>biting off more than we can chew</u>. When we bite off more than we can chew, we attempt to do more than is possible.</p>

<p><small>Here is a VOA Learning English <em>English in a Minute</em> video explaining the idiom "to bite off more than you can chew."</small></p>
<p>Now, let's hear these some of these terms and expressions used in a <strong>conversation</strong>.</p>
<p><em>A: So, how are your classes going?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Not great. Many of my best students are failing my course. They all missed an important deadline for a project. </em></p>
<p><em>A: That's strange. What else do they have going on?</em></p>
<p><em>B: A lot! They are all performing in the same play. So, they have had <strong>rehearsals</strong> every night for the past month. And many have part-time jobs as well. </em></p>

<p><em>B: Well, first I'll extend the deadline. And then I'm going to warn them about biting off more than they can chew. </em></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Archeological research has uncovered another treasure of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii: a large private <strong>bathhouse</strong>.</p>
<p>The explosion of Mount Vesuvius in 70 AD buried Pompeii in thick ash, wreckage, and lava, or hot liquid rock. Archeologists are continuing to find remains of the city under the ground.</p>
<p>The bathhouse was part of a large private house, the scientists said. The bathhouse holds a series of rooms that would have provided hot, warm, or cold conditions. The art and design of the complex, including <strong>mosaic</strong> works, also suggest the owner was wealthy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A picture released by the Pompeii Archeological Park Press Office, Friday, January 17, 2025, showing a private bathhouse recently discovered in the Pompeii archeological site.

(Archeological Park of Pompeii Press Office Via AP, HO)</span></div>
<p>“We have here perhaps the largest<strong> thermal</strong> complex in a private house in Pompeii,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.</p>
<p>He explained that Pompeii's powerful and wealthy set up large spaces at their homes to hold major gatherings for ceremonies and other purposes.</p>
<p>“It was an <strong>opportunity</strong> to show the wealth in which they lived and also to have a nice thermal treatment," he said.</p>
<p>The baths were unearthed in the so-called Regio IX, a large central area of Pompeii Park that is still unexplored.</p>
<p>Recently, archeologists working in the same area found a <strong>bakery</strong>, a <strong>laundry</strong> and two homes. They also found the bones of three people who died in the volcanic burst.</p>
<p>Pompeii was not the only city destroyed in the explosion. It also buried the city of Herculaneum.</p>
<p>Zuchtriegel said wealthy citizens of Pompeii often would first take a bath and then attend a banquet, or a big meal. The private thermal complex permitted them to do so together at the home where the banquet was held.</p>
<p>“There is room for about 30 people who could do the whole <strong>routine</strong>, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the caldarium, a very warm environment, and also a large <strong>tub</strong> with cold water,” he said.</p>

            <title>Minimal Pairs for Pronunciation  (2025/1/25)</title>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em> we answer a question from Doraemon in Japan. Here is Doraemon's question:</p>
<p><em>Hi VOA,</em></p>
<p><em>For me, as an English learner, words like clash, crash, and crush sound like the same word.<br/>
Can you help me to tell one word from others?<br/>
Thank you.</em><em> </em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Minimal Pairs for Pronunciation" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c708a5b5-901a-473a-884f-4201ea6b2eeb_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Minimal Pairs for Pronunciation</span></div>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Doraemon.</p>
<p>When a foreign language contains sounds that do not exist in a person's native language, it can be difficult for learners to hear those sounds.</p>
<p>The reason you have difficulty hearing the difference between “crash” and “clash” is because the Japanese language does not have the consonant sounds “r” or “l.” And when English speakers are talking quickly, the difference between the sounds of “r” and “l” becomes very small. As a result, those two consonants can sound the same to a native Japanese speaker.</p>
<p>Some vowel sounds can also be difficult to hear or pronounce depending on the vowels a person's native language has. For example, consider the difference between the following two words:</p>
<p><em>hit heat</em></p>
<p>The Spanish language has the vowel sound in the word “heat,” but it does not have the vowel sound in the word “hit.”</p>
<p>As a result, Spanish speakers will sometimes pronounce words like “hit,” “bit,” and “little” with an “ee” sound. For example, the two words “hit” and “heat” will both sound like “heat” when spoken with a Spanish <strong>accent</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Train your ears using minimal pairs</strong></p>
<p>You can learn to hear the difference between sounds in a foreign language by careful <strong>practice</strong> using minimal pairs. Minimal pairs are two words that differ from each other by only one sound.</p>
<p>For example, the two words “hit” and “heat” differ from each other by only one sound.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for using minimal pairs:</p>
<p>Find lists and recordings of minimal pairs through a Google search or on YouTube. For Japanese speakers, find minimal pairs that differ between the sounds of “r” and “l.” Be sure to include minimal pairs that place the two sounds at the beginning, middle, and end of words. Here are examples:</p>
<p><em>rake lake</em></p>
<p><em>correct collect</em></p>
<p><em>hair hail</em></p>
<p>Carefully listen to the pronunciation of the minimal pairs. At first, it might be difficult for you to hear the difference between them. But over time you will start hearing the difference.</p>
<p>Also practice pronouncing these sounds. Learning to pronounce them can help you hear them. To pronounce them, you need to practice putting your tongue in the correct position.</p>
<p>The tongue is a muscle. Just as we can train our muscles to play a sport, we can train our tongue to move to the correct positions for pronouncing a foreign language. This <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94MMQ1av_-s">How to Pronounce video</a> from VOA Learning English shows the tongue positions you need to pronounce the letters “r” and “l” correctly.</p>

<p>A group of sheep on farmland in the American state of Texas work together to complete a job: eating the grass growing beneath hundreds of<strong> solar panels.</strong></p>
<p>Sheep have become a<strong> symbol </strong>of a growing solar industry as large-scale solar farms appear across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Solar grazing </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Sheep walk near solar panels on a solar farm owned by SB Energy on Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024, in Buckholts, Texas. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a524fb24-ab1f-4d74-b382-0600d7b1c1c9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Sheep walk near solar panels on a solar farm owned by SB Energy on Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024, in Buckholts, Texas. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)</span></div>
<p>In Milam County, Texas, SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country. It can produce 900 megawatts of power across 1,618 hectares.</p>
<p>So, how does the company deal with all the grass that grows on such a large piece of land? It deploys about 3,000 sheep that keep the grass cover low. Sheep, unlike devices such as lawnmowers, can fit between small spaces and work in all kinds of weather conditions.</p>
<p>The work of the sheep, and sometimes other animals, is called solar grazing. It is considered part of the larger idea of agrivoltaics --- the use of land for both solar energy production and agriculture.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/agrivoltaics-coming-soon-farm-near-you#:~:text=Agrivoltaics%20is%20the%20use%20of,workers%20on%20hot%20summer%20days." target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> suggests that solar grazing may help the environment in several ways. These include making grassy areas safer for wild animals, like nesting ground birds, and by reducing fuel use and air pollution.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics is on the rise with more than 60 solar grazing projects in the U.S., the National Renewable Energy Laboratory says. The American Solar Grazing Association says 27 states take part in solar grazing.</p>
<p><strong>A sunny opportunity </strong></p>
<p>Putting the animals to work on solar fields also provides some help to the sheep and <strong>wool</strong> market, which has struggled in recent years. The number of sheep and lambs in Texas fell to 655,000 in January 2024, a 4 percent drop from the year before. That information comes from the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often good for animals to eat grass on, the power plants have been used in cooperation with farmers rather than against them.</p>
<p>Sheep farmer JR Howard accidentally found himself in the middle of Texas' move to clean energy. In 2021, he and his family began working with solar farms. Howard's sheep ate the grass on these large areas of land.</p>
<p>What was once a small business has turned into a larger operation with more than 8,000 sheep and 26 employees.</p>
<p>“Just the growth has been kind of crazy for us,” said Howard, who named his company Texas Solar Sheep. “It's been great for me and my family.”</p>
<p><strong>Following the herd </strong></p>
<p>Some agriculture experts say Howard's success shows how solar farms have become a big help for some <strong>ranchers</strong>.</p>
<p>Reid Redden is a sheep farmer and solar <strong>vegetation</strong> manager in San Angelo, Texas. Redden said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly hard to find.</p>
<p>“Solar grazing is probably the biggest <strong>opportunity</strong> that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations,” Redden said.</p>
<p>Redden suggested that people in the rural communities near where he raises sheep have been very positive about solar grazing.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics itself is not new. Solar farms use a lot of land and require a lot of space that could be used for food production.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics helps with the problem by permitting the two industries to coexist, whether growing food or caring for livestock.</p>
<p>There is a lot still unknown about the full effects of solar grazing, said Nuria Gomez-Casanovas of Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>Not enough studies have been done to know the long-term environmental effects, such as how good the soil will be for future agriculture. However, Gomez-Casanovas suspects solar grazing may improve sheep productivity.</p>
<p>“We really have more questions than answers,” Gomez-Casanovas said.</p>

            <title>Researchers: Female Family Ties Important to Social Networks  (2025/1/23)</title>

<p>A recent study suggests that female family ties were central to social networks in ancient Celtic society before the Roman invasion.</p>
<p>Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in Britain shows that women were closely related. At the same time, unrelated men were more likely to come into the community from other places, likely after marriage.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers examined ancient DNA from 57 burial places in Dorset in southwestern England. People used the cemetery from around 2100 years ago to around 1800 years ago.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by Bournemouth University in January 2025 shows burials being investigated at an Iron Age Celtic cemetery as part of the Durotriges tribe project dig in Dorset, southwest England.

(Bournemouth University via AP)</span></div>
<p>The results showed that two-thirds of the individuals descended from a single maternal lineage.</p>
<p>Lara Cassidy of Trinity College Dublin was one of the study's co-writers. Cassidy suggested to the Associated Press (AP) that the results were surprising, or in her words, “jaw-dropping.”</p>
<p>She said that such a finding had “never been observed before in European prehistory.”</p>
<p>The study appeared recently in the scientific publication <em>Nature.</em></p>
<p>The research suggests that women stayed in the same circles throughout life. They kept social networks and likely inherited or managed land and property.</p>
<p>Cassidy told the AP that the findings suggest, “it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood.”</p>
<p>Such a way of living is called matrilocality. The researchers said it is historically rare.</p>
<p>Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone is with the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Gnecchi-Ruscone was not part of the study.</p>
<p>He said researchers studying burial places in Britain and Europe have only discovered the opposite behavior. He said in those communities, women left their homes and families to join their husband's family group.</p>
<p>He said such a way of living, known as patrilocality, has been observed in other ancient time periods. These include the Neolithic period which started more than 10,000 years ago to the early Medieval period more than 1000 years in the past.</p>
<p>Cassidy said in studies of pre-industrial societies from around 220 years ago to the present, researchers found that men join their wives' extended family households only eight percent of the time.</p>
<p>But researchers already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A group of tribes with closely related languages and art that is often described as Celtic lived in England before the Roman invasion about 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>Valuable objects have been found buried with Celtic women. Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disrespect about their relative independence and fighting abilities.</p>
<p>The network of strong female family connections that the researchers found does not necessarily mean that women also held official positions of political power.</p>
<p>Study co-writer Miles Russell of Bournemouth University in England researches ancient societies. He said the findings do suggest that women had some control of land and property and strong social support. Such a situation made Britain's Celtic society more “egalitarian” than the Roman world, Russell said.</p>

            <title>Meta Ends Third-party Fact-Checking, Adds ‘Community Notes’ System  (2025/1/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Facebook parent company Meta recently announced changes to the way it tries to identify misinformation and harmful material published on its social media services.</p>
<p>Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg <a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/">explained</a> in a video that the company had decided to make the changes because the old system had produced “too many mistakes and too much <strong>censorship</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Meta moderation</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Facebook logo is seen on a cell phone in Boston, USA, Friday, Oct. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2ac5b816-9f18-48ba-9521-fb24fec5d49b_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Facebook logo is seen on a cell phone in Boston, USA, Friday, Oct. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)</span></div>
<p>Zuckerberg said the <strong>moderation</strong> system Meta had built needed to be “complex” to examine huge amounts of <strong>content</strong> in search of material that violated company policies.</p>
<p>However, he noted the problem with such systems is they can make a lot of errors. The Meta chief added about such systems, “Even if they accidentally censor just one percent of posts, that's millions of people.”</p>
<p>So, he said the company had decided to move to a new system centered on “reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression.”</p>
<p><strong>“Community Notes” system</strong></p>
<p>The new method turns over content moderation duties to a “Community Notes” system. The company said this system aims to “empower the community” to decide whether content is acceptable or needs further examination.</p>
<p>The changes will be effective for Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Threads services. Meta said the new system would become available first to U.S. users in the coming months.</p>
<p>Meta's former moderation system involved the use of independent, third-party fact-checking organizations. Many of these were large media companies or news agencies. The efforts included digital tools as well as human workers to fact-check content and identify false, <strong>inappropriate</strong> or harmful material.</p>
<p>Meta said the third-party moderation method ended up identifying too much information for fact-checking. After closer examination, a lot of content should have been considered “<strong>legitimate</strong> political speech and debate.”</p>
<p>Another problem, the company said, was that the decisions made by content moderators could be affected by their personal beliefs, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_6ywWHIXG">opinions</a> and <strong>biases</strong>. One result was that “a program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor.”</p>
<p>Meta's new Community Notes system is similar to the method used by the social media service X. A statement by Meta <a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/">said</a> changes to this system will have to be made by users, not anyone from the company.</p>
<p>Meta said, “Just like they do on X, Community Notes will require agreement between people with a <strong>range</strong> of <strong>perspectives</strong> to help prevent biased ratings.” The company also invited any users to register to be among the first to try out the system.</p>
<p><strong>How did fact-checkers react to Meta's change?</strong></p>
<p>The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) criticized Meta's latest decision. It said the move threatened to "undo nearly a <strong>decade</strong> of progress."</p>
<p>The group rejected Zuckerberg's claim that the fact-checking program had become a "tool to censor" users. It noted, that "the freedom to say why something is not true is also free speech."</p>
<p>Milijana Roga<i></i>269; is executive editor of the Serbian fact-checking outlet Istinomer. She told Reuters news agency that she thinks Meta's decision would end up hurting the media industry. Roga<i></i>269; noted that research suggests that many citizens use Meta services as their main source for information. Removing independent fact-checkers “further <strong>hinders</strong> access to <strong>accurate</strong> information and news," Roga<i></i>269; said.</p>
<p><strong>How effective are Community Notes?</strong></p>
<p>Not a lot of research has been done on how effective Community Notes systems are. But one effort carried out by the University of California and Johns Hopkins University found in 2024 that community notes entered on X for COVID-19 misinformation were accurate. The research showed the notes used<strong> </strong>both moderate and high-quality sources and were attached to widely read posts.</p>
<p>However, the number of people taking part in that study was small. Also, the effects the system had on users' opinions and behavior is unknown.</p>
<p>A 2023 study, from the <em>Journal of Online Trust and Safety,</em> said it was harder for users to agree when they examined content related to political issues.</p>

            <title>Red Coloring Linked to Cancer Risk Banned in US Foods  (2025/1/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/red-coloring-linked-to-cancer-risk-banned-in-us-foods.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">22 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned a chemical widely used to color some food products red. The ban of the coloring chemical, called dye, came nearly 35 years after it was removed from skin products because of a possible cancer risk.</p>
<p>A group of food safety and health supporters issued a <strong>petition</strong> in 2022 seeking to have the FDA ban Red No. 3 in food.</p>
<p>The earlier ban was ordered in 1990, after two studies showed Red No. 3 caused cancer in male rats eating high levels of the chemical. At the time, however, the FDA only acted to ban the coloring mixture in products put on the skin or in drugs taken by mouth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This image shows a pile of candy corn in Westchester County, N.Y., Oct. 23, 2023. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/180ce991-0d5d-4e08-bc3a-8f328f0a5d77_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This image shows a pile of candy corn in Westchester County, N.Y., Oct. 23, 2023. </span></div>
<p>Health activists had long sought FDA approval to expand the ban to food products. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red No. 3.</p>
<p>Some of the most common products containing Red No. 3 include sweets, icing, strawberry milk, maraschino cherries, strawberry protein drinks, as well as some gummy vitamins and medications.</p>
<p>The FDA said food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products.</p>
<p>Other countries still permit certain uses of the dye. But any imported products will still have to meet the new U.S. requirement. Red No. 3 is already banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, except in certain kinds of cherries.</p>
<p>The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027. And lawmakers in Tennessee, Arkansas and Indiana have also proposed limits on certain dyes, especially from foods offered in public schools.</p>
<p>Jim Jones is the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revoke-authorization-use-red-no-3-food-and-ingested-drugs">noted</a> that even though the agency had established the new ban, “the way that FD&amp;C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not <strong>occur</strong> in humans." FDA officials said the ban was enacted because of a U.S. rule called the Delaney Clause. This legal policy requires the FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Lurie is director of the <strong>consumer</strong> activist group the Center for Science in the Public Interest. He helped lead the latest effort to remove Red No. 3 from food products. Lurie told The Associated Press, "This is a welcome, but long <strong>overdue</strong>, action from the FDA.”</p>
<p>The International Association of Color Manufacturers has repeatedly said Red No. 3 is safe in levels usually taken in by humans. The group pointed to research carried out by scientific experts from the United Nations and the World Health Organization. One study, released in 2018, confirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.</p>
<p>Some food manufacturers have already changed their products to remove Red No. 3. One example is Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings. In its place, the company uses beet juice, a dye made from insects and other coloring mixtures.</p>

            <title>Make a Memory Palace to Improve Your English  (2025/1/22)</title>

<p>
Sherlock Holmes is an imaginary private detective created by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1880s. Doyle's stories about the detective have been turned into movies and television shows.</p>
<p>One of Sherlock Holmes' great skills is a powerful memory. In a recent BBC television series, the character uses a memory technique called a “mind <strong>palace</strong>” or “memory palace.”</p>
<p>On one show, for example, Holmes has been severely wounded in a shooting and retreats into his mind to search for ways to survive. He visits rooms in his mind palace, looking for helpful memories. In one room, he finds his childhood dog, and the memory helps calm the detective.</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/142EFFF5-F4C5-4CAE-A8C1-C76F629E3DD6_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>The memory palace idea was not a BBC creation. The method for remembering has existed for thousands of years. Many language educators today teach their students how to use the method to improve their language skills.</p>
<p>But what exactly is a memory palace? It is a real structure, such as a home or building, that you can picture in your head. You then imagine placing things you want to remember inside the structure.</p>
<p>You can use a memory palace to remember words, <strong>phrases</strong>, facts, or even the order of events. If you can see the inside of a house or building in your mind, you can make your own memory palace. On today's Education Tips, we will show you how.</p>
<p><strong>Making your palace</strong></p>
<p>Start with a list of words or phrases that you want to remember. Then, close your eyes and choose a physical space that you know well, such as your home, a school you attended, or a current or former workplace. If your chosen space has only one or two rooms, do not worry. You can also use things like doors, passageways, steps or other permanent places along the physical path.</p>
<p>The next step is to imagine walking through the space using the path that you would normally take through it. As you walk through, put objects that you want to remember at specific places along the path. Leave the objects there to pick up later when you visit your memory palace.</p>
<p>Now, let's try this technique by using six <strong>ingredients</strong> for a pizza: flour, water, dry yeast, tomato sauce, cheese and basil.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and picture a home.</p>
<p>First, you open the front door and see a bag of flour on the floor. The bag is broken and some of the flour has spilled. You are worried that you might <strong>slip</strong>, so you carefully step over the area.</p>
<p>Second, you walk into your bedroom. On top of your bed sits a cup of water. The cup is shaped like an upside-down piece of pizza. You think about how funny that is and laugh about it.</p>
<p>Third, as you enter the living room, you see a very large <strong>spoon</strong> of dry yeast sitting on the <strong>sofa</strong>. The spoon is watching a cooking show on television.</p>
<p>Fourth, while standing in the living room, you notice the room has a strange smell to it. You look above the television and see a block of cheese hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>Fifth, you walk into the <strong>kitchen</strong> and see two tomatoes chasing each other around the room. Suddenly, they crash and explode, covering the floor in red.</p>
<p>And sixth, you open the back door and go outside. There, you see a group of very tall green basil plants. In a funny voice, the tallest plant says, “Choose me! Choose me!”</p>
<p>Did you notice anything strange about the palace? It was full of extraordinary and humorous imagery. We will say more about that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But first, let's check how well our technique worked. See if you can answer these questions:</p>
<p>1-What was on the wall above the television?</p>
<p>2-Where were the tomatoes and what were they doing?</p>
<p>3-Which object was sitting on the bed?</p>
<p>4-Where was the yeast and what was it doing?</p>
<p>5-Which ingredient spoke and what did it say?</p>
<p>6-What did you see when you opened the front door?</p>
<p>My <strong>guess</strong> is that you remembered everything in our memory palace. That's good news.</p>
<p><strong>Make memory strong</strong></p>
<p>Experts offer some advice for making strong memory palaces.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to remember a lot of words, memory trainer Anthony Metivier suggests first <strong>drawing</strong> a simple map of your memory palace. Then, number the places along your path where you will put the things that you want to remember. You can put more than one thing in each room or area. Later, you will add the mental imagery.</p>
<p>English teacher James, of the YouTube channel JamesESL English Lessons, has additional advice. In his video on memory palaces, he says that there are three <strong>keys</strong> to a strong memory palace. They are: emotion, movement, and connections between the object and something permanent.</p>
<p>Both he and Metivier say imagining things in a humorous or crazy way improves your ability to remember them. These experts also agree that connecting images to actions or movement will create lasting memories. For instance, the tomatoes were chasing each other and the basil spoke.</p>
<p>And finally, teacher James suggests placing the objects next to or on something permanent in your palace. Beds, sofas, floors, walls, doors – all of these are permanent. The block of cheese was on the wall, for example.</p>
<p>Now, it's your turn. Pick a list of English words or phrases that you have trouble remembering and try this method on your own.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <title>Nepal Supreme Court Bans Large Business Development in Protected Areas  (2025/1/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Nepal's Supreme Court has struck down disputed laws that permit waterpower centers,<strong> </strong>visitor housing such as hotels, and other business development in protected natural areas. Environmental defenders say the January 15 ruling is a victory for efforts to protect the country's natural areas.</p>
<p>Nepal has recognized one fifth of its territory as protected natural areas. The country has 12 national parks and six conservation areas. They include lowland areas such as Chitwan National Park. The park is home to many wild animals such as tigers and rhinos. Other protected areas include Sagarmatha National Park, home to Mount Everest.</p>
<p>Waterpower, or hydropower, and <strong>tourism</strong> represent major economic sources for Nepal. Last year, its government passed laws to permit development of large projects in some parts of national parks, forests and other protected areas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Nepalese mahouts walk their elephants through the Rapti River from Chitwan National Park in Sauraha, Chitwan, 170 kilometers (106 miles) south from Katmandu, Nepal, Monday, Dec. 26, 2011.

<p>Padam Bahadur Shrestha is a Nepalese environmental activist who took legal action against the laws. He told Agence France Press that the laws' passage showed that the government lacked <strong>insight</strong> and was only seeking to please business investors.</p>
<p>Shrestha praised the Supreme Court's ruling, saying it "<strong>preserves </strong>ecology and <strong>biodiversity</strong>.”</p>
<p>Nepal is recognized worldwide for its actions to protect its wild animal and plant life.</p>
<p>Nepal's environmental protection laws have helped the local tiger population increase from 121 animals in 2010 to 355 in 2023. And while only about 100 one-horned rhinos were living in Nepal in the 1960s, their number increased to 752 in 2021.</p>
<p>Nepal also increased its tree cover by almost 100 percent between 1992 and 2016. Wood industry activities, or logging, had deforested many areas of the country for tens of years earlier.</p>
<p>Rampreet Yadav is a former <strong>conservation</strong> officer of Chitwan National Park, Nepal's largest protected area. He said the recent laws “should never have been passed."</p>
<p>"If development projects are <strong>allowed</strong> in protected areas, they will destroy our nature and animal habitats," he added.</p>
<p>The Nepalese government wants to develop its hydropower industry, especially along rivers in the Himalayan mountains. Last October, it signed agreements with India and Bangladesh to export thousands of <strong>megawatts</strong> of hydropower.</p>
<p>Nepal also earns much money from tourism. Last year, around one million foreign visitors came to Nepal, and the government has been spending money on the development of its airports.</p>

            <title>No Soil Needed to Grow Air Plants at Home  (2025/1/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/no-soil-needed-to-grow-air-plants-at-home.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">20 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>If you are looking for houseplants that do not take up a lot of space and are easy to grow, air plants might be the right choice.</p>
<p>There are more than 500 different <strong>species </strong>of air plants. Officially they are known as Tillandsia. These plants are native to places in<strong> </strong>North and South America that support year-round plant growth. Air plants belong to the same family as the pineapple.</p>
<p>Instead of soil, these plants attach themselves to things like trees, rocks and buildings. They do not cause problems for the objects they grow on. Air plants do not have roots. They depend on specialized cells – called trichomes – to permit their leaves to take in water and nutrients.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Drift in Air Plants shows a Tillandsia xerographica air plant in Bakersfield, California. (Jennifer Tuttle/Drift in Air Plants via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/38950b6c-8cd1-4636-8a34-17153f9148cb_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by Drift in Air Plants shows a Tillandsia xerographica air plant in Bakersfield, California. (Jennifer Tuttle/Drift in Air Plants via AP)</span></div>
<p>Associated Press gardening writer Jessica Damiano has experimented with air plants and offers these guidelines for people wanting to grow them.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight</strong></p>
<p>Air plants require bright, indirect light. So, they should be placed near an east- or west-facing window, but not directly in front of it. Direct sunlight can burn the plant's leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Watering</strong></p>
<p>In homes with average <strong>humidity</strong> levels, put air plants in a bowl of room-temperature water once a week for 30 to 60 minutes. In homes with drier air, this process can be repeated when needed.</p>
<p>Lightly shake the plants to remove extra water. Then, place them upside-down on a cloth to dry for several hours. This step is necessary to prevent water from collecting on the plant's leaves, which can cause damage.</p>
<p>If using chlorinated water, it is best to let the liquid sit for 12 to 24 hours to permit the chemical to <strong>dissipate</strong> before watering plants. Air plants are especially sensitive to chlorine.</p>
<p><strong>Feeding the plants</strong></p>
<p>Growers should feed their air plants with any all-purpose houseplant, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_eTz32nqz">bromeliad</a> or orchid fertilizer. The substance should be added to the soaking water monthly to provide added nutrients. Use about half the amount suggested by the fertilizer manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Life cycle</strong></p>
<p>Air plants <strong>bloom</strong> only once. The resulting pink, coral, purple or white flowers are a signal that the plants are nearing death. However, air plants produce offshoots, known as “pups.” These can be separated into new plants once they grow to about one-third the size of the parent.</p>
<p><strong>So many choices</strong></p>
<p>Notable air plants include Spanish moss which can be found hanging from large trees in tropical or subtropical areas. In the home, Spanish moss is grown in a humid environment, such as a bathroom.</p>
<p>Another kind is Tillandsia <em>ionantha</em>, which is also known as the sky plant. It is a <strong>shaggy</strong>-looking plant with green bracts. Bracts are leaf-like structures that grow from the area just beneath a flower. The tops of <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_lnnkCrAw">bracts</a> can turn pink or purple before flowering.</p>
<p>Tillandsia <em>caput-medusae</em> is named for its similarity to the snake-haired head of Medusa, from Greek mythology. The plant is popular because of its long, wavy leaves that grow upward from a fat, round base.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unusual species of Tillandsia is the <a class="wsw__a" name="_Hlk187660007">Xerographic</a> air plant. This kind is known as the King of Air Plants. It can grow up to about one-half meter. The plant's long, thin silver leaves <strong>curl </strong>downward to produce a round shape that sets it apart from other air plants.</p>
<p><strong>How to show your Tillandsia</strong></p>
<p>You can place air plants in just about any spot that provides the required sunlight and good air flow.</p>
<p>Glass containers or <strong>terrariums</strong> are popular choices. But growers can also put air plants inside seashells or on rocks. One could even create a floating Tillandsia garden by hanging several plants from <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_dYc5qcDC">fishing</a> line.</p>
<p>The plants can also be attached to natural wood pieces with wire or glue. Some choose to grow them inside hanging <strong>frames</strong>. When choosing placement possibilities, the main thing to keep in mind is to make sure you are fully meeting all the plant's needs.</p>

            <title>Learn to Have Better Balance and Prevent Falls as You Age  (2025/1/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/learn-to-have-better-balance-and-prevent-falls-as-you-age.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">20 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>To age well, doctors say we should remember the importance of good balance. It matters when you wash yourself, put clothing on and, generally, move around in your home and elsewhere. As we age, good balance permits us to live more independently.</p>
<p>Difficulties with balance can be dangerous. The United States Centers for Disease Control reports that three million older people in America seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year. But we can prevent some falls, said Roopa Anmolsingh. She is a geriatrician, a doctor who specializes in treating old people. She is also the creator of the balance class program at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. She said that "Some people have a <strong>misconception</strong> that part of getting old is, you're going to fall. That's not true. You can control how you fall, or if you fall."</p>
<p>To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old. Here are the questions:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A couple walk on a sidewalk in Santiago, Chile, Wednesday on May 3, 2017. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/e26a4513-386c-4b2e-b739-68d383c6ac29_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A couple walk on a sidewalk in Santiago, Chile, Wednesday on May 3, 2017. </span></div>
<p><strong>Do I ever feel unsteady?</strong></p>
<p>If you feel<strong> </strong>unsteady, or lose balance, from time to time, ask your doctor to check all your body systems that can affect balance. Along with muscle and bone problems, unsteadiness can also result from poor blood pressure, inner-ear problems, nervous system issues and more.</p>
<p>Maybe you do not have unsteadiness but wonder about your skill at balancing. You can test yourself easily and at home to find out if you need any medical intervention.</p>
<p>Stand next to a wall or something that can provide support if needed. Raise one leg. Can you hold that position for 10 seconds? Now try the other leg. If you can stand on each leg alone for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics at the University of Miami in Florida.</p>
<p>"If you can't do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist," he said. A physical therapist treats people with conditions or injuries that affect body movement.</p>
<p>Another at-home test is called TUG, for "timed up and go." Hartley suggests doing this test with supervision. You begin the test from a seated position. Then, stand up and start a timer immediately. Walk three meters, turn and walk back to your seat. Stop the timer as soon as you sit down. If the test takes you longer to complete than 15 seconds, your risk for falling is very high. But, if you do it in 12 seconds or less, your fall risk is almost zero.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ncoa.org/tools/falls-free-checkup/">The National Council on Aging offers an online set of questions</a> to predict your risk of a fall.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do to improve balance?</strong></p>
<p>Because muscle mass lessens in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to keep good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. Anmolsingh says it is never too late to act on that advice.</p>
<p>Activities including<strong> tai chi</strong> and <strong>yoga </strong>are good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while <strong>shifting</strong> body weight. There also are simpler exercises people can work into their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Anmolsingh says standing on one foot while waiting in line at a store is good. Or, at home, sit down and stand up several times straight without using a support. Another easy exercise is the three-way leg lift. Hold on to a support, then lift a leg to the front, then to the side and then to the back.</p>
<p><strong>How often should I do the exercises?</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Aging says people should spend at least 150 minutes per week in general physical activity to improve balance and overall health.</p>
<p>Hartley said exercises done on a usual basis help train the brain to react correctly when you start to fall.</p>
<p>"Just like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you're doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities," he said.</p>

            <title>Researchers Use Lasers to Study Ancient Peruvian Mummies   (2025/1/20)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">19 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>For more than 5,000 years, humans have covered themselves with permanent artistic designs known as tattoos.</p>
<p>In a recent study, researchers used lasers to uncover highly complex designs of ancient tattoos on <strong>mummies </strong>from Peru.</p>
<p>The skin of the mummies and the black liquid, or ink, used to make the tattoos permitted researchers to observe fine details. These marks are not <strong>visible</strong> to the human eye, said study co-writer Michael Pittman of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This August 2024 photo provided by researchers shows a mummified human from Peru's Chancay culture.

(Tom Kaye via AP)</span></div>
<p>The researchers examined around 100 mummies dating to around 775 years ago. The mummies were from coastal Peru's Chancay culture, which grew and developed before the Inca empire and the arrival of Europeans.</p>
<p>All the individuals had some form of tattoos on the back of their hands, knuckles, arms or other body parts. The study paid careful attention to four individuals with “<strong>exceptional</strong> tattoos” — designs of shapes such as triangles and diamonds, said Pittman.</p>
<p>It was not clear how the tattoos were created. But they are “of a quality that stands up against the really good electric tattooing of today,” said Aaron Deter-Wolf of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology. Deter-Wolf was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>The study results appeared recently in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2421517122" target="_blank">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>
<p>Using lasers that make skin <strong>glow</strong>, “we basically turn skin into a <strong>light bulb</strong>,” said study co-writer Tom Kaye of the nonprofit Foundation for Scientific Advancement based in Sierra Vista, Arizona.</p>
<p>The findings were “helpful to learn about new non-destructive technologies that can help us study and document sensitive archaeological materials,” such as mummies, said Deter-Wolf.</p>
<p>The oldest known tattoos ever discovered are on the remains of a Neolithic man who lived in the Italian Alps around five thousand years ago. Many mummies from ancient Egypt also have tattoos, as do remains from cultures around the world.</p>
<p>People have used tattooing for many reasons throughout history. The marks can show cultural or individual identity, social standing, and more. Tattoos also have been used for protection against disease or to deepen relationships with spirits or gods, suggested Lars Krutak. Krutak, who works at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>Designs on ancient <strong>textile</strong> and stone products are more commonly found in good condition for study than are ancient tattoos. But ancient tattoos when studied can provide information about art forms that would not otherwise be available, suggested Martin Smith of Bournemouth University. Smith was not involved in the recent study.</p>

<p>Two private spacecraft are on their way to the moon to carry out separate <strong>missions</strong>.</p>
<p>The landers launched January 15 from the American government's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The private company SpaceX used its Falcon 9 launch vehicle to fly the landers into space. The two separated from Falcon 9 about one hour into the flight.</p>
<p>Mission leaders said the launch went exactly as planned, with no problems reported. The trip to the moon will take some time. One spacecraft is expected to land on the <strong>lunar</strong> surface in early March, while the other should touch down in late May or early June.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from pad 39A with a payload of a pair of lunar landers at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2025.

<p>In February 2024, the first private spacecraft completed the first U.S. moon landing in more than 50 years. The lander, called Odysseus, was developed by the Texas-based company Intuitive Machines. The spacecraft experienced some technical problems but was able to carry out several science experiments before powering down permanently on the moon in late March.</p>
<p>For this current mission, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace developed Blue Ghost, one of the two landers launched. The other, named Resilience, belongs to Japanese company ispace. Both are designed to collect data and materials to support several planned moon missions – some including astronauts – in coming years.</p>
<p>The Blue Ghost lander is targeting a landing site near a volcanic structure called Mons Latreille. It is a 480-kilometer basin that sits in the northeast quarter of the near side of the moon.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA says the 2-meter-tall Blue Ghost is carrying 10 NASA science and technology instruments. They aim to “gather valuable scientific data studying Earth's nearest neighbor,” the agency said.</p>
<p>NASA's Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The next planned flight in that program is <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/">Artemis II</a>, which is set to launch in April 2026. In that mission, four astronauts will fly NASA's Orion spacecraft more than 400,000 kilometers on a trip around the moon.</p>
<p>Nicola Fox is the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington D.C. She said in a statement the agency's cooperation with private companies is “a critical part of bringing humanity back to the moon.”</p>
<p>Fox added that NASA chose the new experiments partly because of information learned from NASA's Apollo space program, which began in the 1960s. She said the current mission seeks to ensure “the safety and health of our future science instruments, spacecraft, and, most importantly, our astronauts on the lunar surface.”</p>
<p>Blue Ghost's equipment includes a tool to collect dirt and another to dig a hole for measuring temperatures below the lunar surface. The spacecraft is also carrying a device built to measure light <strong>reflections</strong> to be used with lasers to better measure the distance between Earth and the moon.</p>
<p>In addition, Blue Ghost is carrying instruments to examine the structure and density of areas beneath the lunar surface. Other equipment will seek to capture X-ray images of the edge of Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p>The ispace lander Resilience is carrying an exploring vehicle, called a rover, to the moon. The five-kilogram rover is designed to collect lunar soil and other materials from the surface.</p>
<p>Resilience is also <a class="wsw__a" href="https://ispace-inc.com/news-en/?p=6795">carrying equipment and instruments</a> to complete several experiments for Japanese companies and other organizations. One of the experiments will test an <strong>electrolysis</strong> device designed to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. Such a device could help future astronauts better use water resources on the moon and produce rocket fuel.</p>
<p>Other experiments set for the Resilience mission include food production tests and the deployment of a “deep space radiation probe.” The instrument is designed to collect detailed measurements of <strong>ionizing</strong> radiation in space.</p>
<p>NASA has said it is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Officials from ispace did not report how much its mission would cost.</p>
<p>It is the second moon mission for ispace. During the last one, Japan's space agency JAXA successfully launched its SLIM spacecraft to the moon in January 2024. But the lander touched down imperfectly, causing some communication and power problems.</p>
<p>However, Japanese space officials reported they had stayed in communication with SLIM through late April. During this time, they said the spacecraft was able to collect valuable data about the landing and surrounding area.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>In life, some of our decisions and actions are well thought out. They involve research, examination, and time for thought. And other decisions and actions are not well thought out. We make them quickly, without thinking, almost like a pure physical reaction.</p>
<p>We can call these decisions, actions or reactions <u>knee-jerk</u><strong>.</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Liberty Barros holds her Guinness World Records' certificate for achieving the fastest 20-meter back bend knee-lock walk in 22.53 seconds, in London, Britain, November 10, 2022.

<p>This term comes from a medical process. Meriam Webster defines the noun "knee jerk" as “an <strong>involuntary </strong>forward kick produced by a light blow on the tendon below the kneecap.” It is an involuntary action. It's <strong>automatic.</strong></p>
<p>The words “involuntary” and “automatic” are important when understanding the term “knee jerk” and when to use it. Knee-jerk reactions seem to happen automatically without a decision-making process.</p>
<p>We often use “knee jerk” as an adjective.</p>
<p>Like hitting your kneecap to move your leg, knee-jerk reactions or statements also seem like an involuntary <strong>reflex</strong>.</p>
<p>"Knee jerk" also describes predictable<strong> </strong>behavior. Again, hit the knee, the leg will kick every time. So "knee jerk" describes someone who always reacts quickly and without enough thought.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are on a team with someone who never faces responsibility for their mistakes in the game. If brought to account, the player always blames the dropped ball on other teammates. You can say that player is having a knee-jerk reaction to criticism. They have a <u>go-to</u> response. It's like a reflex they can't control.</p>
<p>We often use knee-jerk in a criticizing or <strong>negative </strong>way.</p>
<p>Now, a <u>gut reaction</u> also happens without thinking. But it is a bit different than a knee-jerk response. A gut reaction is a feeling. When we have a gut reaction, our <strong>instincts </strong>are telling us that something may not be right. Gut reactions are instinctual warnings.</p>
<p>So, we also use this expression a bit differently than "knee jerk." We usually talk about our own gut reactions or impulses, not others.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>One day, I was hiking on a mountain in California. I had hiked for about two hours and was near the top. The view, I was told, was truly beautiful. I couldn't wait to see it! Then, suddenly, I had a strange feeling. Something just didn't feel right. I can't explain why, but my gut instinct was to turn around and head back down the mountain. I later found out that a dangerous bear had been sighted in the same area that I had fled. I am so thankful I listened to my gut instinct.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>On January 20, the United States president is sworn into office in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The inauguration is an important ceremony that officially marks the start of an administration. As part of the event, the incoming president speaks to the nation and announces U.S. policy goals.</p>
<p>This year, expanded security measures will stretch across much of Washington. The city's mayor, Muriel Bowser, announced major street closures and special transportation measures to increase security during inauguration events.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Security fencing surrounds Capitol Hill as snow blankets the region ahead of a joint session of Congress to certify the votes from the Electoral College in the presidential election, in Washington, Monday, Jan. 6, 2025.

<p>The Associated Press reports Washington D.C.'s National Guard will deploy 7,800 soldiers to help with security. The Secret Service is reportedly under additional pressure because of two attempts on the life of incoming President Donald Trump last year. In one of those attempts, Trump received minor injuries.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress has saved many historical documents and objects from past ceremonies. Here are some facts and firsts about U.S. presidential inaugurations:</p>
<p><strong>Inaugural firsts: </strong></p>
<p>George Washington did not take the <strong>oath </strong>to become the first U.S. president in January nor was the event held in Washinton, D.C. His first inaugural <strong>address </strong>was given to a joint session of Congress gathered in Federal Hall in New York City, on April 30, 1789. New York City was the nation's first capital.</p>
<p>Washington began a tradition that stood for many years of kissing The Bible after taking the oath of office. The Museum of the Bible <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.museumofthebible.org/book-minute/washingtons-inauguration" target="_blank">says</a> on its website that four other presidents – Warren Harding,</p>
<p>Dwight Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush – used Washington's Bible in their ceremonies. Bush had hoped to use Washington's Bible for his first inauguration in 2001, but weather delayed shipping so he ended up using a family Bible instead.</p>
<p>Washington's second inaugural address set another mark: it was the shortest at 135 words.</p>
<p>For 144 years, the inauguration was not held in the winter, but mostly in March.</p>
<p>John Adams, the nation's second president, was the first to receive the oath from the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. His swearing in took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the nation's second capital.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. He walked to and from the ceremony instead of riding in a <strong>carriage</strong>. The U.S. Marine Band played at the event for the first time and has done so in every ceremony since.</p>
<p>In 1825, John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, broke with tradition. He was the first president to long wear pants instead of traditional shorter pants with stockings. The man who replaced Adams, Andrew Jackson, was the first to receive the oath on the East Portico of the Capitol Building. John Quincy Adams refused to attend.</p>
<p>In 1837, Martin Van Buren was the first of a new generation of presidents to not have British ancestry. His parents were Dutch and he was born a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>William Henry Harrison set an unhappy first: On Inauguration Day in 1841, he gave the longest-ever speech without wearing warm clothes. He became sick and died weeks into his term.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln gave his first inaugural speech surrounded by heavy security as the nation neared war between the North and South. His second address, in 1865, was shortly after the end of the U.S. Civil War. He urged Americans “With <strong>malice</strong> towards none; with <strong>charity</strong> for all” to “<strong>bind up</strong> the nation's wounds.” In 2009 and 2013, Barrack Obama took his oath on Lincoln's Bible.</p>
<p>In 1909, William Howard Taft's inauguration was notable for taking place inside the Senate Chamber because of a huge snowstorm. It took about 6,000 men to clear snow for the parade.</p>
<p>The inaugural ceremony of Calvin Coolidge in 1925 was the first to be broadcast on radio. And the first president to have a televised inaugural ceremony was Harry Truman in 1949.</p>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt's second inauguration was the first to take place on January 20th. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution moved the event's date because of improved transportation methods.</p>
<p>In 1953, Dwight Eisenhower broke the tradition of kissing The Bible and instead gave a prayer.</p>
<p>Robert Frost was the first poet to every speak at an inaugural event. Frost <strong>recited</strong> his poem <em>The Gift Outright</em> for John Kennedy's 1961 swearing-in. Kennedy was the first Roman Catholic president. Joe Biden was the second.</p>
<p>After Jimmy Carter's inauguration, he and first lady Rosalynn Carter walked down Washington D.C.'s Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House instead of riding inside a car.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan's inaugurations set two marks that may also never be equaled. At noon on Reagan's first inauguration, the temperature was nearly 13 degrees Celsius. That was the warmest Inauguration Day ever. Then, on his second in January 1985, the temperature was nearly minus 14 degrees Celsius – the coldest day ever for the event.</p>
<p>This year, January 20 will mark only the second time a U.S. president has been inaugurated for a second term that did not follow the first. Donald Trump first took the oath of office in 2017. He joins Grover Cleveland, who was inaugurated in 1885 and 1893. Cleveland is known as the 22nd and 24th President. Trump is set to be both the 45th and 47th President of the United States.</p>

            <title>What Is Art Deco and Why Is It Popular Again?  (2025/1/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Art Deco is an international artistic <strong>style</strong> that was popular in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>Now, interest in the style and its qualities is growing. A new generation is enjoying the style's roots and turning it into something new.</p>
<p>A public showing, or exhibition, at the Museum of the City of New York provides a look at the style that helped define the city 100 years ago.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt=" This image provided by the Museum of the City of New York shows a postcard featuring the Empire State Building, from left, the RCA Building, and the Chrysler Building. (Museum of the City of New York via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/109dd6c2-c5fb-4357-ac6b-7c78d81c96af_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption"> This image provided by the Museum of the City of New York shows a postcard featuring the Empire State Building, from left, the RCA Building, and the Chrysler Building. (Museum of the City of New York via AP)</span></div>
<p>Famous Art Deco buildings include the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall.</p>
<p>The public showing, called “Art Deco City: New York Postcards from the Leonard A. Lauder Collection,” also has clothing and film clips from the time.</p>
<p>In London, the Victoria and Albert Museum has a collection of day and evening clothing, jewelry and more. The collection comes from Les Ballets Russes, a dance company that had a major effect on <strong>fashion</strong>.</p>
<p>And in Paris, organizers of the 2024 Olympics created Art Deco <strong>posters</strong> last year to celebrate the games and mark the one hundred years since the 1924 Olympics, which Paris also hosted.</p>
<p><strong>A style of the 1920s and 30s </strong></p>
<p>Experts have different opinions about Art Deco. Design writer Arricca Elin Sansone, for example, said last year in Elle Décor magazine: “Ask three historians to define the term Art Deco, and you'll likely get three <strong>varying</strong> answers.”</p>
<p>Appearing after World War I, the first Art Deco era had a spirit of creativity and freedom. With the aim of appearing modern, the style became one of the most important forms of design in the 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
<p>The Art Deco style is believed to have first appeared at the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, in Paris.</p>
<p>The early 1930s saw the development of the style in Miami where South Beach's Art Deco District is popular with visitors and a center for design.</p>
<p>In some large cities, low-rise buildings of two or three floors turned into landscapes of high-rise skyscrapers. Public and private spaces showed <strong>themes</strong> involving geometrical designs and luxurious materials.</p>
<p>In transportation, faster cars and better trains suggested a new age while jazz music urged people to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>“A fashionable renaissance” </strong></p>
<p>The same energy can be found in today's fashion shows and red-carpet events for stars. Some of today's colorful clothing suggests the Jazz Age, another name for the period when Art Deco was popular. Stars like Zendaya, Gigi Hadid, Beyoncé and Demi Lovato have used elements of the Deco era in new ways.</p>
<p>“The aesthetic of the 1920s is enjoying a fashionable renaissance,” said Kirsty Thatcher of the Australian fashion magazine Russh. A “renaissance” represents a rebirth of something from the past.</p>
<p>New York-based interior designer Vanessa DeLeon told the Associated Press, “The boldness and elegance of Art Deco are what appeals to me.”</p>
<p>Jamie Watkins and Tom Kennedy of the London design company Divine Savages include Art Deco elements in their collections of products for the home. Watkins suggested: “It's no wonder we're drawn to it again.”</p>
<p>Lynda Klich is the co-organizer or curator of the exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York. Klich noted that postcards were the social media of their day. Travelers at the time busily wrote messages to friends and family. New York's famous Art Deco buildings appear in over 250 postcards. There is also a selection of clothing from the 1920s, shoes and other objects.</p>
<p>“Art Deco was the look that sold the city to the world,” said co-curator Lilly Tuttle.</p>
<p>The exhibition in New York City runs through February 17.</p>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Krystyna in Poland. Here is Krystyna's question:</p>
<p><em>Dear Teacher,<br/>
I would like to know of different ways to use words such as “apply” and “application” for getting jobs or other purposes.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you, </em><em>Krystyna</em><em>.</em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Apply and Application" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2ca81581-0bba-4ddd-b3f5-fd0855406dac_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Apply and Application</span></div>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Krystyna.</p>
<p>The word “apply” is a verb, and the word “application” is a noun. We can use both words when discussing the process of looking for a job.</p>
<p>We say we “apply for a job” when we go through the official process of asking an employer for work. To do this, we usually have to complete a job application. The application is a <strong>form</strong>, either online or on paper, that gives the employer information about the person applying for the job.</p>
<p>We commonly use the phrasal verb “fill out” to express the act of completing an application. Consider the following examples:</p>
<p><em>You must fill out this application first. </em></p>
<p><em>Did you fill out the application?</em></p>
<p>While we say “apply for” when trying to get a job, we say “apply to” when we are trying to get accepted into a school or other program, as in the following example:</p>
<p><em>She applied to three medical schools in California. </em></p>
<p>However, we say “apply for” when we are trying to get financial aid or special awards.</p>
<p>The expression “apply to” also has another meaning. It can mean that something relates to something else, or that something is true for all people or things. Listen to the following examples:</p>
<p><em>The new rule only applies to people who work more than 40 hours each week.</em></p>
<p><em>The right of freedom of speech should apply to all citizens. </em></p>
<p>The word “application” has other meanings besides a form people fill out. Among these is a computer program that does a specific task, or kind of work. From this meaning, we get the term “Apps,” which we use in our smartphones and computers.</p>
<p>There also is another expression with the verb “apply.” If you “apply yourself,” that means that you are working hard over a period of time to complete a project or develop a skill.</p>

            <title>People in China Swim in Freezing River for Health, Happiness  (2025/1/17)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/people-in-china-swim-in-freezing-river-for-health-happiness.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">16 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>Even as temperatures kept dropping in China's northeastern “ice city” of Harbin, excitement rose among a group of swimmers who enjoy jumping into freezing waters.</p>
<p>The daily event, known as ice swimming, is a winter tradition in Harbin. Swimmers train daily throughout the year to get their bodies ready for the unusual swim. Reporters from The Associated Press recently visited the city and spoke with some of the swimmers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A woman jumps into a pool cut from the ice on the Songhua River in Harbin in northeastern China's Heilongjiang province, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6d1a4494-79e3-42ba-ab34-b82c042182c8_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A woman jumps into a pool cut from the ice on the Songhua River in Harbin in northeastern China's Heilongjiang province, Tuesday, Jan. 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Andy Wong)</span></div>
<p>To create a pool in the Songhua River, the swimmers first had to break a 10-centimeter thick cover of ice. Then they removed the ice pieces, took off all clothes except bathing suits and prepared to enter. One by one, they jumped into a freezing, 10-meter-long pool.</p>
<p>Some of the swimmers reported that their legs and arms quickly went <strong>numb</strong> after entering the water. The outside temperature was about minus 13 degrees Celsius and the water temperature remained near freezing.</p>
<p>One of the swimmers was Chen Xia. She came from Zhejiang province about 1,700 kilometers <strong>further </strong>south. She decided to jump into the river even though she had a cold. Chen said the winter waters where she lives are warmer than those in Harbin.</p>
<p>She said the experience strengthened her <strong>confidence</strong> in winter swimming. She has been taking part in the activity for about 20 years.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old Chen said the freezing waters made her skin feel like small <strong>pins </strong>were attacking her body. But, she added that the experience still brought her happiness. “I felt <strong>prickling</strong> all over my body. But it still made me feel <strong>blissful,</strong>” she said.</p>
<p>Yu Xiaofeng lives in Harbin, a city that sits near the border with Russia. The 61-year-old said winter swimming in the city dates back to the 1970s. At that time, locals saw Russian Orthodox religious believers being <strong>baptized </strong>in the river. Later in 1983, an official winter swimming group was established in Harbin.</p>
<p>The city also holds an ongoing winter celebration known for its huge, detailed ice and snow <strong>sculptures.</strong></p>
<p>Winter swimming is considered a sport in China. But it gained popularity much faster in Harbin than in other parts of the country. Today, Yu said the city is considered a “holy land” for winter swimming.</p>
<p>Yu said the winter swimmers appear to have better health than others. She added that she has felt a great sense of family and joy in the community during her 30 years of winter swimming.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" name="_Hlk187425130">While the AP reporters did not <strong>quote</strong> medical experts for this story, some of the swimmers said they believe ice swimming is good for their health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group even came up with a new saying to describe the experience. They would rather “suffer through winter swimming than line up at the hospital,” Yu said. </a></p>
<p>You Decang is a 76-year-old winter swimmer who said he believes the activity helps keep him healthy. He noted that he has never caught a cold. You added, “If I go just one day without winter swimming, I feel quite <strong>uncomfortable</strong>.”</p>

<p>A spacecraft recently sent back some of the best close-up pictures yet of the planet Mercury's north pole.</p>
<p>The European and Japanese robotic explorer went as close as 295 kilometers above Mercury's night side before passing directly over the planet's north pole.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) released images that show craters with deep <strong>shadows</strong> on our solar system's smallest planet.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by European Space Agency shows close-up photos of Mercury showing northern plains taken by the European-Japanese spacecraft BepiColombo.

<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo/Top_three_images_from_BepiColombo_s_sixth_Mercury_flyby" target="_blank">ESA noted</a> that the edges, or rims, of the <strong>craters</strong> called Prokofiev, Kandinsky, Tolkien and Gordimer create permanent shadows. As a result, these unlit craters are some of the coldest places in the Solar System even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun.</p>
<p>Cameras also took images of neighboring volcanic plains known as Borealis Planitia. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo/Top_three_images_from_BepiColombo_s_sixth_Mercury_flyby" target="_blank">ESA noted</a> that these are “Mercury's largest <strong>expanse</strong> of ‘smooth plains' and were formed by the widespread <strong>eruption</strong> of...lava 3.7 billion years ago.”</p>
<p>Also appearing in the images released by ESA is Mercury's largest impact crater, the Caloris Basin, which covers more than 1,500 kilometers.</p>
<p>This was the sixth and final flyby of Mercury for the BepiColombo spacecraft since its launch in 2018. The recent move put the spacecraft on a path to enter orbit around Mercury late next year. The spacecraft holds two orbiters, one from Europe and the other from Japan, that will circle the planet's poles.</p>
<p>In a statement <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/BepiColombo" target="_blank">on its website</a>, ESA noted that Mercury, a small, dry planet, is “the least explored planet of the inner Solar System. Learning more about Mercury will<strong> shed light</strong> on the history of the entire Solar System.”</p>
<p>The spacecraft is named for the late Giuseppe (Bepi) Colombo, an Italian mathematician. Colombo played a part in NASA's Mariner 10 mission to Mercury in the 1970s and, 20 years later, in the Italian Space Agency's special satellite project that flew on the U.S. Space Shuttle.</p>

<p>At this year's CES show in Las Vegas, Nevada, crowds from around the world came to see the latest products built with artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>CES is produced by the Virginia-based Consumer Technology Association. It presents the latest electronic product offerings or <strong>features</strong>, targeting <strong>consumers</strong>. More than 138,000 people attended the event which ended last weekend.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 companies presented products at CES 2025. Here is a look at some of the top products shown at this year's 2025 show:</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="People attend the CES tech show Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025, in Las Vegas.

<p><strong>Smarter TVs?</strong></p>
<p>CES is historically an event at which large electronics manufacturers introduce their latest and greatest televisions. This year was no different.</p>
<p>South Korean TV makers LG and Samsung both announced new smart models with built-in AI tools. Others – including Japan's Panasonic and China's Hisense and TCL – also released TV models with new AI tools.</p>
<p>Korean manufacturer LG <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.lg.com/global/mobility/media-center/press-release/lg-presents-its-latest-innovations-powered-by-affectionate-intelligence-at-ces2025">said</a> its latest models are equipped with AI technologies designed to <strong>autonomously </strong>improve picture brightness, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_vPy43zj4">sharpness</a> and sound quality. The AI improvements are powered by the company's own <em>a11</em> processer technology.</p>
<p>LG also announced new updates for its Magic Remote device controller, saying new AI tools were added to provide more detailed search and interactive possibilities with users.</p>
<p>Samsung introduced a system called Samsung Vision AI for its line of OLED and QLED TV models. The company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-samsung-vision-ai-and-new-innovations-at-first-look-2025-delivering-personalized-ai-powered-screens-to-enrich-everyday-life">said</a> the AI tools are meant to turn the TVs into more “intelligent” assistive devices and to help “simplify and <strong>enrich</strong> everyday living” for its users.</p>
<p>One example is a feature that permits users to click on different <strong>screen</strong> elements to receive immediate information about what they see. The company said another tool makes it possible to activate live language <strong>translations</strong> on-screen.</p>
<p><strong>Transport and personal robots</strong></p>
<p>Several companies at CES introduced robotic transport vehicles designed to travel over many kinds of surfaces or <strong>terrain</strong>.</p>
<p>One model was built by Kubota, a Japanese maker of farm and building equipment. The company demonstrated how the KATR four-wheeled robot uses <strong>hydraulics</strong> to control the vehicle's four legs independently. This design seeks to keep the robot secure and level even when working on hills or in rocky areas.</p>
<p>Kubota says the vehicle – which is able to carry loads up to 240 kilograms – is small enough to be transported in most pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Chinese developer Unitree Robotics showed off a dog-like robot model called Go2. The robot was designed with a series of cameras, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_snKF8D5S">sensors</a> and AI tools. The company says this permits Go2 to make smooth movements and automatically follow its owner. It is able to carry small loads on its back and can also be used in security operations involving businesses or individuals.</p>
<p>Demonstrations at CES showed Go2 doing tricks, like standing on two legs, dancing and giving high fives to visitors. The company produces several other dog-like models, as well as <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.unitree.com/h1">humanoid robot</a>s.</p>

<p><strong>Aircraft carrier vehicle</strong></p>
<p>The latest flying car designs are also a yearly favorite at CES. But this year, Chinese automaker XPENG took its presentation a step further by introducing a combination truck and flying vehicle.</p>
<p>The company calls the system a Land Aircraft Carrier. It includes a large transport van with enough space to transport a <strong>vertical </strong>landing flying vehicle inside. The idea is for users to be able launch the flying vehicle from anywhere the van can go. The flying car is fully autonomous and can carry two people at a time.</p>
<p>Chinese media reported the company – which also offers several traditional vehicles on its website – plans to sell the combination for about $300,000. XPENG said it will aim to increase production for all its vehicles in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>Self-charging vehicle</strong></p>
<p>California-based Aptera Motors demonstrated a new electronic vehicle model with a built-in <strong>charging </strong>system. The company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://aptera.us/vehicle/#innovation">explains</a> on its <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_qo7S5aBu">website</a> that the vehicle has solar panels on its surface to capture energy from the sun. When charged this way, Aptera claims the car can travel up to 64 kilometers in a single day without being plugged in to a power source. On a full charge, the company says the vehicle can travel up to 640 kilometers.</p><p><strong>Salt enhancing spoon</strong></p>
<p>Japanese drink producer Kirin Holdings introduced <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.kirinholdings.com/en/newsroom/release/2024/1225_02.html">a new product</a> that aims to strengthen, or enhance, the taste of salt in food products without increasing the amount of salt. The spoon-shaped device uses electricity to increase saltiness. The company <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/2025/electric-salt-spoon/">says</a> the tool – which can be taken anywhere – sends a weak electric current through the top of the device to food.</p>
<p><strong>Power-assisted skis</strong></p>
<p>French electric sports equipment maker SQ-Motors presented an all-terrain electric board that can move on roads and snow. The company calls its invention the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sq-motors.com/store/p/sternboard">Sternboard</a>. It is a three-wheeled board with an electric motor in the back.</p>
<p>First designed to be an electric skateboard, a version was developed to move on snow. The powered boards have reached speeds of more than 60 kilometers per hour in tests.</p>
<p>But the snow versions are not designed for speed. They seek to provide users with the ability to go up hills or move long distances over level land.</p>

            <title>Greenland Holds Important Position in a Warming World  (2025/1/16)</title>

<p>Greenland is the world's largest island and a self-governed territory of Denmark. About 57,000 people live there, mainly along its coasts. Most of Greenland lies north of the Arctic Circle, under thick <strong>sheets</strong> of ice.</p>
<p>The island plays a large part in the weather experienced by billions of people every day and in climate changes around the planet, experts say.</p>
<p>American President-elect Donald Trump is expressing interest in buying Greenland from Denmark. He said something similar during his first term in office as well. The United States has a large military base on the island.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Greenland ExplainerFILE - An iceberg floats in the Scoresby Sund, on Sept. 12, 2023, in Greenland.

<p><strong>Greenland's valuable resources</strong></p>
<p>Geologists say Greenland has huge amounts of oil and natural gas below the ice and valuable elements known as rare earth minerals. Rare earth minerals are needed in communication technologies, including phones.</p>
<p>Most of these resources are trapped under Greenland's ice. However, warming temperatures in recent years have increased melting on the island. As more ice melts, some of these resources may become easier to reach.</p>
<p>Geoff Dabelko is a security and environment professor at Ohio University. He thinks other countries are becoming interested in Greenland because China is currently the supplier of more than half of the world's rare Earth minerals.</p>
<p><strong>Melting ice </strong></p>
<p>From 1992 to 2020, Greenland lost an average of 169 billion metric tons of ice each year, with losses reaching 444 billion metric tons in 2019.</p>
<p>Mark Serreze is director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. He told The Associated Press that melting from Greenland will be a central issue through the 21st century. That is because melting ice adds to rising sea levels. Serreze noted that the amount of melting will likely increase in the future.</p>
<p>Greenland also serves as the engine for an important ocean current that influences Earth's climate in many ways, including storm activity. The current is called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. The current is slowing down because more fresh water from Greenland's melting ice is entering the ocean, Serreze said.</p>
<p>A shutdown of the current could lead to long-term freezes in Europe and parts of North America.</p>
<p>“If this <strong>global</strong> current system were to slow <strong>substantially</strong> or even collapse . . .as we know it has done in the past — normal temperature and <strong>precipitation</strong> <strong>patterns</strong> around the globe would change <strong>drastically</strong>,” said climate scientist Jennifer Francis of the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a non-profit based in the American state of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>She added that the changes would have very damaging effects on farming and ecosystems.</p>
<p>As more ice melts, Greenland is also changing color from the white of ice to the blue and green of water and land. These darker colors hold more heat from the sun and can increase the speed of warming.</p>
<p>Greenland lies in between northern Canada, northern Europe, and Russia. That area may become more valuable to countries if melting in the Arctic Ocean continues to increase and more ships pass through the area.</p>

            <title>Students with Disabilities Praise Assistive Technology Using AI  (2025/1/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">14 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Assistive technology involves special equipment and computer software that is meant to help people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The latest assistive technology is being powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which might help many students who have difficulties with speaking, reading, writing, and working with language. Although many schools are struggling with how and where to use AI, some are welcoming AI <strong>applications</strong> for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>The U.S. Education Department requires schools to provide assistive technology to students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a U.S. federal law.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Makenzie Gilkison sits in the lobby at Greenfield Central High School, Tuesday, December 17, 2024, in Greenfield, Indiana." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/9f3e5af8-c4c9-4a75-aaa6-ca1a3bfb5641_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Makenzie Gilkison sits in the lobby at Greenfield Central High School, Tuesday, December 17, 2024, in Greenfield, Indiana.</span></div>
<p>The Education Department has told school officials they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and <strong>alternative</strong> communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also require schools and other government organizations to make apps and online <strong>content</strong> available to people with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns about assistive technology</strong></p>
<p>However, there is concern about how to make sure that students using assistive technology are still learning.</p>
<p>Students can use AI to organize thoughts into an outline, <strong>summarize</strong> complex reading material, or even <strong>translate</strong> the works of William Shakespeare into today's English. A computer can read materials aloud for students who have vision and reading problems. More and more, those voices produced by machine sound closer to human voices.</p>
<p>Alexis Reid is an educational <strong>therapist</strong> in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. Reid said, "I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a <strong>cheat code</strong> in a video game."</p>
<p>But Reid said it is far from cheating: "We're meeting students where they are."</p>
<p>Ben Snyder is a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently told he has a learning disability. He has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. He sometimes uses AI to explain math problems.</p>
<p>He likes a program called Question AI. One day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report. He finished the work in 15 minutes. Usually, it would have taken him an hour and a half to create the same outline. But he said he would not use AI to write the report. "That's just cheating," Ben said.</p>
<p>Paul Sanft is director of a Minnesota-based center where families can use assistive technology tools and borrow devices. He knows some people will use the technology to do the work they should be doing by themselves. “That's always going to happen," Sanft said. "But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before."</p>
<p>The U.S. National Science Foundation is providing financial support for AI research and development. One group receiving support is called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education and is linked to the University of Buffalo in New York state. It is developing tools to help children with speech and language disabilities.</p>
<p>Venu Govindaraju is the director of the institute. He said speech-to-text technology is not as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech problem. He said AI technology is not good at understanding children's handwriting either.</p>
<p><strong>The case of Makenzie Gilkison</strong></p>
<p>Makenzie Gilkison had trouble spelling words. The 14-year-old from near Indianapolis, Indiana, has a condition called <strong>dyslexia</strong>. It makes reading difficult. "I just <strong>assumed</strong> I was stupid," she said, thinking of her early grade school years.</p>
<p>Last year, Gilkison was named to the National Junior Honor Society, an organization that supports leadership and academic success among middle school students. She said she improved her school performance by using a special AI-powered <strong>chatbot</strong>, a word prediction program and other tools that read for her.</p>
<p>"I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them," she said.</p>
<p>In September, Makenzie's school system started using chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers sometimes struggled to provide students with the help they needed. The students were happy when they heard about the program. Until recently, students needed to wait for someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own.</p>
<p>"Now we don't need to wait anymore," she said.</p>

<p>Many historians say U.S. President Ronald Reagan helped defeat the former Soviet Union and end the Cold War. Reagan's efforts included giving support to rebel groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s.</p>
<p>U.S. support for Afghan rebels began earlier under the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Carter ordered secret <strong>nonlethal</strong> aid to rebel groups six months before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union invaded in December of 1979.</p>
<p>Carter worked on cooperation with the Soviet Union by seeking approval of the SALT II (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) agreement on nuclear weapons. At the same time, his policies and statements pushed against Soviet goals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="U.S., Ambassador to the USSR, Thomas Watson meets with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, left, and President Jimmy Carter in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Jan. 4, 1980.

(AP Photo/Dennis Cook)</span></div>
<p>David Gibbs is a history professor at the University of Arizona. Gibbs said, “I think people's image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he's done after he left office. [But] he definitely...had a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p><strong>US aid to rebels</strong></p>
<p>A communist takeover in Afghanistan in April 1978 brought down the government of President Mohammad Daoud Khan.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Carter signed a secret order known as a “presidential finding” that permitted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to give nonlethal aid to rebels. The rebels were fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-supported communist government.</p>
<p>Carter's order stayed secret until the 1990s. It became known after several Carter administration officials, including former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, communicated its existence.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Afghan Trap' </strong></p>
<p>Some historians have called Carter's plan to aid rebel groups the “Afghan Trap.”</p>
<p>They said the trap aimed to force the Soviets into a long war similar to America's fight in Vietnam during the 1960s and early 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1998, Brzezinski denied to the French magazine <em>Le Nouvel Observateur</em> that the Carter administration had a plan to get the Soviets into a long war in Afghanistan. However, he also called such a program “an excellent idea.”</p>
<p><strong>Other explanations of U.S. aid</strong></p>
<p>Conor Tobin is an historian at the University College Dublin in Ireland who has studied the Afghan Trap idea. He said most experts do not believe the aid was part of a plan to make the Soviets fight. Tobin said there is not enough evidence to support the Afghan Trap idea.</p>
<p>Tobin also said the Carter administration decided to first wait to see how the situation in Afghanistan would develop after the 1978 government overthrow. But that policy ended with the kidnapping and killing of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs in February of the next year.</p>
<p>Brzezinski then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan. Tobin said Brzezinski asked an administration official to consider the question: “Should we help any <strong>insurgents</strong>?”</p>
<p>Tobin said U.S. government officials thought military aid to rebels would cause a strong Soviet reaction. This judgment led the Carter administration to give nonlethal aid instead.</p>
<p>“The decision-making process demonstrated <strong>caution</strong>, rather than an effort to <strong>induce</strong> an invasion,” Tobin wrote.</p>
<p>Tobin wrote <a class="wsw__a" href="https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/44/2/237/5699276?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false">in an article</a>, “The Myth of the ‘Afghan Trap,'” about the concerns of U.S. officials. He said, instead of trying to push the Soviets into a fight, Brzezinski worried the Soviets would slowly expand their power in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“The <strong>objectives</strong> in mid-1979 were essentially to do something, anything, to <strong>counter</strong> the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,” Tobin said.</p>
<p><strong>The Carter Doctrine</strong></p>
<p>In 1979, another development raised concerns<br/>
in Washington. Even if Carter did not want armed conflict in Afghanistan, he took a strong position against Soviet efforts to control the Persian Gulf. That body of water lies between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two major oil producers.</p>
<p>During a speech to the U.S. Congress in 1980, Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use “any means necessary” to prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf area.</p>
<p>On December 28, 1979, the day after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, Carter gave permission to supply weapons and training for the rebels.</p>
<p>Carter lost the 1980 election to Reagan who mostly continued Carter's Afghan policy for several years before greatly increasing the secret aid program. The aid reached several hundred million dollars a year, and the Soviet military left Afghanistan in defeat in 1989.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter died at the age of 100 on December 29, 2024.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle Report</em>.</p>
<p>As the new year begins, some people see an opportunity for change and improvement.</p>
<p>Experts say January can be a good time to think about self-improvement. Many people make resolutions. But these promises we make to ourselves require effort to become part of our daily lives. They are meant to last a long time.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The 2025 New Year's Eve numerals are displayed in Times Square, Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/273d4048-06a1-4d7f-9bfa-5423c126d3dd_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The 2025 New Year's Eve numerals are displayed in Times Square, Wednesday, Dec. 18, 2024, in New York.

<p>Studies have shown that up to 70 percent of people who make New Year's resolutions quit their plans within months.</p>
<p>Recently, experts gave advice on keeping New Year's resolutions to the Associated Press.</p>
<p><strong>Start small</strong><br/>
It is difficult to make big changes. Behavioral health experts suggest breaking big goals into smaller targets. For example, if your goal is to improve your health, you could start with small changes. For some meals, you could trade unhealthy foods for heathy ones, or you could exercise for 10 minutes each day.</p>
<p>Once you start reaching smaller goals, the bigger one might not seem so <strong>daunting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Be realistic</strong><br/>
Psychologist Lynn Bufka suggests being realistic about resolutions. She is with the American Psychological Association based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“It's quite daunting to say that you want to lose 50 pounds and thus, will never eat <strong>dessert</strong> again,” she said. “It might be more helpful to say, you're only going to have dessert<strong> </strong>on the weekends and for special <strong>occasions</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Mindset change</strong><br/>
Think about what your resolution is helping you to <strong>achieve</strong>. Do not think about what you are giving up. This can be a powerful way to change your mindset.</p>
<p>Bufka said that thinking <strong>positively</strong> about your end goal and the <strong>benefits</strong> of your changed behavior can increase your motivation, or drive to succeed.</p>
<p>Bufka gave this example. “If I put money in a jar for what I would have spent on chocolate every day, that starts to add up,” she explained.</p>
<p><strong>Make specific goals</strong><br/>
A study of New Year's resolutions published in 2020 found that people who pay attention to specific goals are more successful than those simply trying to give up bad <strong>habits</strong>.</p>
<p>In a group of more than 1,000 people, scientists found the most popular resolutions involved exercise, weight loss and eating habits. Other resolutions had to do with self-improvement, personal finance, and ways to take care of mental health and to reduce <strong>stress</strong>.</p>
<p>Among the 55 percent of people who said they had kept their resolutions after one year, nearly 60 percent of them had made resolutions involving goals. This is compared with 47 percent who chose to avoid behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Involve other people</strong><br/>
Involving others in your efforts might also help. Other people can offer support and hold you <strong>accountable</strong>. When we are held accountable, we are responsible for our actions.</p>
<p>Someone who decides to start exercising more, for example, might join a running group or sign up for a gym class with friends. This can also make exercising more fun.</p>
<p><strong>Use technology</strong><br/>
Experts also suggest using planners to help you keep your resolutions. For example, you can plan your activities for a specific period every morning or evening.</p>
<p>Use reminders and timers on your smartphone. And use group texts for group activities.</p>
<p><strong>Be kind to yourself</strong><br/>
Changing our behavior is difficult, so do not expect <strong>perfection</strong>. There will be times when it feels impossible to keep your resolution, and you will want to give up.</p>
<p>“A great resolution might be, ‘I will be less judgmental with myself,'” said Tamara Russell of the British Psychological Society. “Research shows that the more we develop self-<strong>compassion</strong>, the more compassionate we can become towards others.”</p>
<p><strong>Review and make changes</strong><br/>
To better keep resolutions, Russell suggests reviewing each week. Ask yourself: what has worked? What has not?</p>
<p>She said, “Study your own behavior like a scientist.” Russell added that we should not be afraid to change our resolutions.</p>
<p><strong>Choose the right time</strong><br/>
The last piece of advice might be the most important.</p>
<p>If January 1 feels like a bad time to create a new resolution, make the changes when it makes sense for you.</p>
<p>Russell said it makes “no sense at all” to make resolutions connected to the <strong>calendar</strong> year. Winter is usually a time of rest for much of the natural world.</p>
<p>She said that spring is the season of growth and renewal. So, depending on your life's situation, spring might be a better time for most people to make changes.</p>

            <title>Doctors Concerned about Return of Iodine Deficiency  (2025/1/14)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">13 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>A century ago, iodine deficiency affected children across much of the United States. The problem mostly disappeared during the 1900s after iodine was added to common foods. But doctors are now seeing higher iodine deficiency rates. The rises are blamed on dietary changes and new food manufacturing methods.</p>
<p><strong>What is iodine? </strong></p>
<p>Iodine is an element found in seawater and in some soils — mostly in coastal areas. A French chemist accidentally discovered the substance in 1811. Iodine's name comes from a Greek word meaning violet-colored.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Iodized salt is displayed for a photograph in Philadelphia on Monday, Jan. 6, 2025. (AP Photo/Jonathan Poet)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f2b3fb6f-94d1-471f-a5b5-f372b1965e46_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Iodized salt is displayed for a photograph in Philadelphia on Monday, Jan. 6, 2025.

<p>Later in the 1800s, scientists began to understand that people need iodine to control their<strong> metabolism</strong> and stay healthy. The element is also important for a child's brain development.</p>
<p>One sign of iodine deficiency is an increase in size, or swelling, of the neck. This growth in the neck is known as a goiter. It can appear when the thyroid gland grows to make up for too little iodine to produce hormones that control certain body processes.</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, goiters were commonly seen in children in some parts of the United States. Some of the children showed other <strong>symptoms</strong> in addition to goiters. These included being smaller or experiencing deafness.</p>
<p><strong>Adding iodine to salt </strong></p>
<p>In the past, public health experts realized they could not solve the iodine deficiency problem by feeding everyone seaweed and seafood. But they learned iodine can be included with table salt.</p>
<p>This form of salt, known as iodized salt, first became available in 1924. By the 1950s, more than 70 percent of U.S. households used iodized table salt. Bread and some other foods also had iodine. As a result, iodine deficiency in the U.S. became rare.</p>
<p>But diets have changed over the years. Processed foods now make up a large part of the American diet. Although these foods contain a lot of salt, it is not iodized. Leading bread makers also no longer add iodine. And for people who do salt their food, it is popular now to use kosher salt, Himalayan rock salt or other products that do not contain iodine.</p>
<p>“People have forgotten why there's iodine in salt,” said Dr. Elizabeth Pearce of Boston Medical Center. She is a leader in the Iodine Global Network, a nongovernmental agency working to end conditions linked to iodine <strong>deficiency</strong>. Pearce noted there had been a reported 50 percent drop in U.S. iodine levels studied during the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>
<p><strong>How much iodine is enough? </strong></p>
<p>While most Americans are getting enough iodine through diet, doctors worry this is not the case for women and children – the two groups most likely to be hurt by iodine deficiency.</p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups advise that all pregnant and breastfeeding women get 150 micrograms of iodine each day.</p>
<p>In the last 15 years or so, U.S. researchers have increasingly reported seeing mild iodine deficiency in pregnant women. A Michigan State University study of about 460 pregnant women found about 25 percent of them were not getting enough. That study's lead writer, Jean Kerver, noted that many vitamins for pregnant women do not contain iodine. As a result, doctors suggest that pregnant or breastfeeding women check <strong>labels</strong> to make sure the vitamins or supplements they take have iodine.</p>
<p>Some studies have linked even mild iodine deficiency to a lower score on an intelligence test known as an intelligence quotient (IQ) test. But experts say there has not yet been enough research to establish exactly how the U.S. population is being affected by iodine deficiency.</p>
<p>Dr. Monica Serrano-Gonzalez of Brown University said she and other doctors had seen five cases of iodine deficiency in children visiting a local health center in Providence, Rhode Island. “We're concerned this may be increasing, especially in patients with restricted diets.”</p>
<p>Serrano-Gonzalez called for increasing publicity about the problem in order to prevent it from getting worse. She said, “This needs to be on people's radar.”</p>

<p>NASA says a spacecraft that has been examining the sun's outermost atmosphere recently got closer to our Earth's star than any past explorer has.</p>
<p>The American space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-makes-history-with-closest-pass-to-sun/">announced</a> its Parker Solar Probe passed within 6.1 million kilometers of the sun's outer <strong>corona</strong> on December 24. Mission leaders established communication with the spacecraft after the operation and said the orbiter was safe.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/us-space-agency-spacecraft-to-study-the-sun-up-close/4519399.html">NASA launched</a> the Parker Solar Probe in August 2018. Its mission is to study the sun's powerful corona and solar wind. Solar wind is created by a continuous flow of charged particles, called plasma, into space from the corona.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image made available by NASA shows an artist's rendering of the Parker Solar Probe approaching the Sun. (Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/971A6A95-9035-4350-A016-397FE05D7016_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image made available by NASA shows an artist's rendering of the Parker Solar Probe approaching the Sun. (Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>In 2021, NASA announced the orbiter had passed into the solar atmosphere for the first time. Researchers said at the time, the spacecraft had successfully “touched” the sun. Parker was believed to be about 13 million kilometers from the center of the sun when it crossed over into the sun's outer atmosphere.</p>

</span>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/heliophysics/nasas-parker-solar-probe-makes-history-with-closest-pass-to-sun/">In a statement</a>, NASA's Associate Administrator Nicky Fox praised the spacecraft's latest pass-by of the sun. “Flying this close to the sun is a historic moment in humanity's first mission to a star,” she said. Fox leads the agency's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Parker Solar Probe is believed to have traveled at speeds up to 692,000 kilometers per hour during the mission. NASA said this was “faster than any human-made object has ever moved.”</p>
<p>Fox said she hopes data collected by the spacecraft can help scientists better understand how the sun behaves and influences other elements in our solar system and beyond. “By studying the sun up-close, we can better understand its <strong>impacts</strong> throughout our solar system, including on the technology we use daily on Earth and in space.”</p>
<p>Fox added that such studies can provide valuable information “about the workings of stars across the universe to aid in our search for <strong>habitable</strong> worlds beyond our home planet.”</p>
<p>NASA's statement noted the agency's earlier preparation and operations were all leading up to the latest mission. To help it get into the right position, the Parker Solar Probe received assistance from several <strong>flybys</strong> of the planet Venus. The last flyby happened on November 6, 2024.</p>
<p>These gravitational assists had put the spacecraft “an ideal distance” from the sun every three months, NASA explained. This distance was “close enough to study our sun's mysterious processes,” but not “to become <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the sun's heat and damaging radiation.”</p>
<p>Developers of the spacecraft say it was built with a <strong>shield</strong> made with carbon material to protect it from the extreme heat released by the sun's corona. The shield was designed to survive temperatures reaching 1,400 degrees Celsius. NASA says the data-gathering instruments are placed behind the shield.</p>
<p>Nour Rawafi is the project scientist for Parker Solar Probe at NASA's Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. His team designed, built, and operates the spacecraft. He said Parker had performed as planned although it operates in “one of the most extreme environments in space.”</p><p>Rawafi added that the mission had brought “a new <strong>golden era</strong> of space exploration, bringing us closer than ever to unlocking the sun's deepest and most <strong>enduring</strong> mysteries.”</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Westlake is director of NASA's <strong>Heliophysics</strong> Division, the part of the agency that studies the sun. Westlake noted that his team is preparing for more flybys in the future and hopes to capture more valuable data. Already, flybys of Venus have gathered information about the natural radio waves coming from Venus.</p>
<p>In 2023, scientists announced they had learned new information about solar wind from data collected by Parker. Data showed that solar wind can reach speeds up to 1.6 million kilometers per hour. Solar wind forms a large magnetic barrier known as the heliosphere. It protects Earth and other planets from the continuous flow of high-energy particles from the sun's corona.</p>

            <title>How Does Drinking Alcohol Affect Your Health?  (2025/1/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/how-does-drinking-alcohol-affect-your-health.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">12 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Past research suggested drinking alcohol in moderate amounts could be good for the heart. But a growing number of public health experts now advise people to limit alcohol intake as much as possible to improve health.</p>
<p>One of those experts is Dr. Timothy Naimi. He is with the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Naimi told The Associated Press, "Drinking less is a great way to be healthier."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy called for changing his agency's existing health warning on alcoholic drinks to include cancer risks. Such a change would require approval from Congress.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Mixed drinks are displayed at a bar in Baltimore on Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1bfcb880-8cfa-4038-8141-7fde340c1aa7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Mixed drinks are displayed at a bar in Baltimore on Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2023. </span></div>
<p><strong>What is the harm in drinking alcohol?</strong></p>
<p>The Surgeon General's proposed change is linked to research suggesting that drinking alcohol raises the risk of several types of cancer – including colon, liver, breast, mouth and throat.</p>
<p>Alcohol breaks down in the body into a substance called acetaldehyde. This chemical can damage cells and stop them from repairing themselves. The process can create conditions for cancer to grow.</p>
<p>Naimi said estimates show thousands of U.S. deaths could be prevented each year if people followed government dietary guidelines on drinking alcohol. The guidelines advise men to limit themselves to two drinks or fewer per day and women to one drink or fewer per day. An example of one drink would be equal to one 12-ounce can of <strong>beer</strong>, a 5-ounce glass of <strong>wine</strong> or one serving of <strong>liquor</strong>.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgeon General Murthy noted there are about 100,000 alcohol-related cancer cases in the United States each year. And, about 20,000 alcohol-related cancer deaths are reported yearly. "As you consider whether or how much to drink, keep in mind that less is better when it comes to cancer risk," Murthy <a class="wsw__a" href="https://x.com/Surgeon_General/status/1875150696884084803">wrote</a> on the social media service X.</p>
<p><strong>What about limited drinking?</strong></p>
<p>Medical experts say the idea that moderate drinking can cause health improvements, or benefits, came from imperfect studies. The research compared groups of people based on how much they drank, with amounts usually measured at only one point in time. Since some earlier studies did not follow rules about what groups were measured, researchers say they did not effectively prove cause and effect.</p>
<p>Naimi said people who report drinking moderately generally have higher levels of education, higher earnings and better resources for health care. He explained that when those elements are considered, “The benefits <strong>tend</strong> to disappear."</p>
<p>Another problem, Naimi noted, was that most studies did not include younger people. Almost half of people who die from alcohol-related causes do so before the age of 50. Naimi said the studied groups did not effectively represent all drinkers. This likely created “an appearance” of a benefit for moderate drinkers that is not real, he added.</p>
<p><strong>What do international guidelines say?</strong></p>
<p>Health guidelines related to alcohol intake have wide differences from country to country. But the overall message today is that drinking less is better for health.</p>
<p>Britain, France, Denmark, Holland and Australia recently examined new evidence and lowered their guidelines for safe amounts of alcohol. Ireland plans to begin requiring cancer warnings on alcohol containers starting in 2026.</p>
<p>Carina Ferreira-Borges is an adviser on alcohol for the World Health Organization in Europe. She said scientists had changed their minds from earlier research. This is because more recent studies suggest drinking alcohol is linked “to over 200 health conditions, including cancers, <strong>cardiovascular</strong> diseases and injuries."</p>
<p>Naimi said, "The simple message that's best supported by the evidence is that, if you drink, less is better when it comes to health."</p>

</span>
<p>Now, from VOA Learning English, it's time for Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>If this is your first time with us, this program explores words and expressions commonly used in American English. We take a look at where they come from and how best to use them.</p>
<p>So, as winter officially comes to half the world, today we celebrate an expression that means winter is coming.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ice crystals cover glass in Detroit, Monday, Jan. 21, 2019. Falling temperatures replaced the weekend's falling snow Monday as bitter cold and gusty winds swept across the eastern United States. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/64933768-3190-43e3-a8b0-1cc544caa6fc_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>When temperatures drop and a <strong>cold snap </strong>comes, that means one thing: <strong>Jack Frost</strong> has arrived!</p>
<p>Jack Frost represents the coming of dark, cold days. He is the personification of winter, a human form of winter weather. So, when we say, “Jack Frost is nipping at your nose,” we mean that you feel the cold, icy effects of winter on your face.</p>
<p>When a frost or deep freeze comes, you had better <strong>bundle up</strong>! You should wear enough clothing to stay warm.</p>
<p>Now, Jack Frost does, indeed, bring the cold of winter. But he can also create beauty in nature. Some traditions claim that Jack Frost is responsible for leaving ice and snow on windows, trees, the ground...anywhere it will stick.</p>
<p>While we know frost is a natural event, it is fun to think that an imaginary creature named Jack Frost (or another name in some other cultures) changed the world into a <strong>winter wonderland</strong>!</p>
<p>That is what poet Hannah Flagg Gould (1789-1865) must have been thinking when she wrote a poem called The Frost.</p>
<p>Here are parts of that poem.</p>
<p>THE FROST looked forth, one still, clear night,</p>
<p>And he said, “Now I shall be out of sight; ...</p>
<p>Then he went to the mountain, and <strong>powdered</strong> its crest,</p>
<p>He climbed up the trees, and their <strong>boughs</strong> he dressed</p>
<p>With diamonds and pearls...</p>
<p><strong>A conversation</strong></p>
<p>With all of its beauty and extremes, winter is a great subject for songs and poetry. But now, let's listen to how we use these wintry expressions in conversation:</p>
<p>Brrr! It is freezing outside. This <strong>cold snap</strong> came out of nowhere!</p>
<p>I don't care how cold it is. I'm going on a hot date!</p>
<p>Is that all you're wearing? You need to <strong>bundle up</strong> or <strong>Jack Frost will be nipping at more than your nose</strong>!</p>
<p>I'll be fine. I'm wearing my new coat.</p>
<p>That it is NOT a winter coat. I mean, it looks great, but it's much too thin. You will <strong>catch a cold</strong>. I know. You can wear my new down coat. It keeps you warm up to minus 30 degrees Celsius!</p>
<p>I'm going on a date...not exploring the Arctic Circle! Thanks. But I am not wearing that big, thick black coat. Besides, the taxi will take me from door-to-door.</p>
<p>But what if something goes wrong? What if the car <strong>skids</strong> on the ice and is involved in an accident? You'll have to walk to the restaurant. You might <strong>freeze to death</strong>!</p>
<p>No, I won't. I'll just call an Uber to come and get me.</p>
<p>And what if that vehicle runs out of fuel? Then you'll have to walk to get more.</p>
<p>No, the Uber driver will. I'll just call another car.</p>
<p>What if that new Uber driver is a pregnant woman and she goes into labor? You'll have to help. You'll have to wait outside in the cold until help arrives! And the roads are already covered with five centimeters of snow! It could take the <strong>ambulance </strong>an hour to get to you! If you're wearing that thin coat...you'll<strong> catch your death</strong>!! The <strong>EMT</strong>s will find you <strong>frozen solid </strong>like a block of ice!!</p>
<p>Stop! Stop!! You win! Give me your coat!</p>
<p>Good decision.</p>
<p>Here's my ride ...</p>
<p>Don't forget gloves...a hat...and a scarf! Okay, good bye. Have fun!</p>
<p>And that's the end of this Words and Their Stories.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Ann. Here is part of Ann's question:</p>
<p><em>Dear Teachers,<br/>
<br/>
I don't really understand the difference between "remaining," "remainder" and "rest" when using these words to describe what is left of something. </em></p>
<p><em>For example, . . . can I replace "the remaining countries" by "the remain" or "the rest"? </em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Remaining, Remainder, and Rest of" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7fec96d9-b0b6-44bf-b18e-0a0dc96e9647_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Remaining, Remainder, and Rest of</span></div>
<p><em>Thank you, Ann.</em></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Ann.</p>
<p>English has many words that share the same meaning or that are close in meaning. So, you might wonder why we usually use one word instead of another that is very similar to it.</p>
<p>We often use one word instead of another because of grammar. Let's look at how this works by considering the last part of your question. You asked:</p>
<p><em>can I replace "the remaining countries" by "the remain" or "the rest"? </em></p>
<p>The answer is no. That's because the word “remain” is a verb, and the term “the rest” is a quantifier. To describe the word “countries,” we need to use an adjective. The <em>-ing</em> ending on the word “remaining” makes it an adjective when we place it before a noun.</p>
<p>If you want to use the words “the rest” to describe a noun, you need to use four words. These four words are “the rest of the.” These four words mean the same thing as the two words “the remaining.” The following example shows this:</p>
<p><em>The rest of the countries use more land for farming.</em></p>
<p>Now let's look at the first part of your question:</p>
<p><em>I don't really understand the difference between "remaining," "remainder" and "rest" when using these words to describe what is left of something. </em></p>
<p>The word “remainder” is a noun, but when we use it to describe what is left of something, we change it to a quantifier. To do this, we usually say or write the four words “the remainder of the.” In this way, it works the same way as the quantifier “the rest of the.”</p>
<p>However, we use the quantifier “the rest of the” much more often, especially in spoken English, than “the remainder of the.”</p>
<p>Also, you should know that as a noun, “the remainder” is a term used in mathematics. It can mean the decimal fraction that remains when one number is divided by another number that is not one of its <strong>factors</strong>. For example, six-tenths, or .6, is the remainder when 33 is divided by five. It can also be what is left over from the process of subtraction.</p>

            <title>Danish-Swedish Farmdog Is American Kennel Club’s Newest Breed  (2025/1/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/danish-swedish-farmdog-is-american-kennel-club-s-newest-breed.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>The American <strong>Kennel </strong>Club, or AKC, has named another kind of dog to its registry.</p>
<p>Say hello to the Danish-Swedish farmdog. Or maybe say "hej," the word for hello in Swedish and Danish.</p>
<p>AKC officials announced the addition to its list on January 2. The recognition means the breed now may compete for many best in show prizes. It also will probably create wider interest in the small, lively dogs. Fans of the breed are happy for the honor, but some also worry about the effect increased attention will have on the dog.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the American Kennel Club shows a Danish-Swedish Farmdog, the latest dog in the American Kennel Club's lineup of recognized breeds. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2724a052-7bb3-4abc-9beb-6b1c8a2cb6e3_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by the American Kennel Club shows a Danish-Swedish Farmdog, the latest dog in the American Kennel Club's lineup of recognized breeds. </span></div>
<p>Carey Segebart is one of the people who worked to get Danish-Swedish farmdogs recognized by the AKC. "We're excited about it. We're looking forward to it," she said. She plans to show one of her own at a dog show this month near her home in the American state of Iowa.</p>
<p>Still, she thinks more attention can have both good and bad results for the breed. "We don't want the breed to just explode too quickly," she said.</p>
<p>The Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America says the breed, DSF for short, goes back centuries in parts of what are now Denmark, southern Sweden and some other European countries.</p>
<p><strong>Fun little dogs</strong></p>
<p>"They're interesting, fun little dogs," said Segebart, who has owned them since 2011 and is the club's incoming president. She said they will try anything and “succeed at most everything."</p>
<p>In their homelands, the dogs' main job was to control small animals called rodents. However, they also can <strong>herd</strong>, act as watchdogs and be playful with children. The club says some Danish-Swedish farmdogs have even performed in <strong>circuses</strong>.</p>
<p>After Denmark and Sweden became more developed in the 20th century, DSF fans decided to make the breed official in both nations. Kennel clubs there began registering the breed in 1987.</p>
<p>In the United States, many of the about 350 Danish-Swedish farmdogs nationwide already compete in <strong>agility</strong>, obedience or other<strong> </strong>sports that are open to all dogs, including mixed breeds.</p>
<p>Until now, the dogs could not enter the traditional breed-by-breed judging that leads to best in show prizes at major dog shows. They may appear later this year at two major televised events, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship.</p>
<p>The Danish-Swedish farmdog is the AKC's 202nd breed and "a wonderful addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and mental <strong>stimulation </strong>that it needs," said the AKC's Gina DiNardo.</p>
<p>Danish-Swedish farmdog lovers talked for several years about whether they should try to get AKC recognition and the attention that is likely to come with it, Segebart said. The number of people wanting to buy a young farmdog, or puppy, has grown quickly over the last ten years. The wait for a DSF puppy is usually a year or more, she said.</p>
<p>Fans of the breed worry that its appealing, relatively easy-care nature could make it quickly become too popular for its own good. They are not the first to worry. Similar concerns surround the French bulldog, which the AKC now says is the most popular breed in the country. Breeding for desired qualities has led to many health problems for the dogs.</p>

            <title>Small Businesses Say US TikTok Ban Would Hurt Them  (2025/1/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/small-businesses-say-us-tiktok-ban-would-hurt-them.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">08 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>As the date nears for a possible U.S. ban on the video sharing service TikTok, some small companies are saying such a ban would hurt their business.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/tiktok-asks-court-to-block-us-ban-seeks-us-supreme-court-hearing/7896146.html">ordered</a> TikTok's China-based parent, ByteDance, to sell the social media <strong>app</strong> by January 19 or face the ban. Lawyers for ByteDance and TikTok have sought legal action to temporarily block the Justice Department's order.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to consider the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office January 20, has asked the Supreme Court to delay a ban to permit solving the problem through “political means.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE PHOTO: Illustration shows TikTok app logo. (Reuters image)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/be5db508-d144-4fc7-b816-2ab0fdaaf4d2_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE PHOTO: Illustration shows TikTok app logo. (Reuters image)</span></div>
<p>U.S. officials have long warned that TikTok presents national security concerns. The government accuses ByteDance of sharing user data with China's government. Critics have said China could also use TikTok to spread misinformation and that material published on the service can harm the mental health of young users.</p>
<p>TikTok has repeatedly denied the accusations. The company has said it sees the app as an important tool to support Americans' right to free speech.</p>
<p>Industry experts have said a U.S. ban on TikTok could affect millions of small businesses that use the service to grow.</p>
<p>TikTok launched in the United States in 2016. Since then, many small business owners have been using it in different ways. These include marketing and advertising campaigns to introduce new products. Many companies also sell goods directly through the app.</p>
<p>TikTok's own estimates suggest small businesses currently using the service would lose more than $1 billion in revenue in a single month if the ban goes into effect.</p>
<p>One example of how TikTok can be used to quickly grow a business is the experience of Desiree Hill. She is the owner of Crown's Corner Mechanic in Conyers, Georgia.</p>
<p>She told the Associated Press that sharing videos of her work on TikTok helped spread the word online about her business. As a result, the app made her services so popular she was able to open her own shop with five employees 18 months ago.</p>
<p>“Every day I get at least two to three <strong>customers</strong> that have seen me on TikTok, watched my videos and wanted to become a customer,” Hill said.</p>
<p>If a ban on TikTok is established, many businesses would likely move to other services to reach customers. Instagram Reels, Snapchat and YouTube Shorts are three possibilities. Many small companies already use those apps. But business experts say it might be harder to get teens who have long used TikTok to start using other apps.</p>
<p>Another way for businesses to reduce the effects of a ban would be for them to build a strong base of customers who are willing to provide their contact emails or phone numbers. That permits owners to reach out directly to users with new offers and other marketing messages.</p>
<p>Hill, of Crown Corner Mechanics, worries that other services would not reach as many possible customers as TikTok. She said she is already using YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, but has not been getting the same results.</p>
<p>“I am worried because there is no preparation for this,” Hill told the AP. She added, “If I lose TikTok, I will lose a large part of my business or I will lose my ability to grow anymore.”</p>
<p>Crystal Lister uses TikTok for her business, called Mommy and Me: The Listers, in Cypress, Texas. The company offers <strong>interactive</strong> educational training in subjects including technology and science. Now, she is seeking to move her offerings to YouTube and Instagram Reels but says TikTok is easier to use.</p>
<p>“It is going to be a <strong>challenge</strong> if TikTok is banned because we're losing kind of all the <strong>functionality</strong> you want,” Lister said. These could include video creation methods and the ability to spread product details through social media. “So we'll have to use many other platforms to <strong>supplement</strong> what TikTok did in one.”</p>

            <title>Pope Francis Names First Woman to Lead Major Vatican Office  (2025/1/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/pope-francis-names-first-woman-to-lead-major-vatican-office.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">08 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Pope Francis has named the first woman to lead a major office of the Roman Catholic Church. On Monday, he chose an Italian <strong>nun</strong>, Sister Simona Brambilla, to head the department responsible for all the church's religious orders.</p>
<p>The appointment is the latest effort by Francis to give women more leadership positions in governing the church. In the past, women have been named to secondary leadership positions in some church offices. But the pope's latest appointment is the first time a woman has been named head of a department of the central governing body of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Official media for the church reported "Sister Simona Brambilla is the first woman <strong>prefect</strong> in the Vatican." A prefect is a chief government officer in the church. Since the Vatican – the place in Rome where the church is headquartered – is officially considered a country, prefect leaders serve like officials in other governments.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pope Francis kisses the baby Jesus as he presides over an Epiphany mass in St.Peter's Basilica, at the Vatican, Monday, Jan. 6, 2025. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b37d5e3b-e1b9-4e95-9c75-1ef6698ecf37_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Pope Francis kisses the baby Jesus as he presides over an Epiphany mass in St.Peter's Basilica, at the Vatican, Monday, Jan. 6, 2025. </span></div>
<p>The position held by the 59-year-old Brambilla is one of the most important in the church. It is officially known as the Dicastery for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. This means Brambilla is now responsible for every Catholic religious order churchwide.</p>
<p>Pope Francis also named a male church official, <i></i>193;ngel Fernández Artime, as a co-leader to Brambilla. The reason for having a co-leader is that only men can lead religious services, known as masses, in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Brambilla has been a member of the Consolata Missionaries religious order. Since last year, she had served as secondary leader in the religious orders department. She will be replacing the current prefect, retiring Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz, who is 77 years old.</p>
<p>Brambilla is a <strong>nurse</strong> who worked as a <strong>missionary</strong> in Mozambique and led a religious order from 2011-2023. In 2023, Francis appointed her to be <strong>secretary</strong> of the religious orders department.</p>
<p>Francis made Brambilla's appointment possible with reforms made in 2022 to the church's founding constitution. The changes permit individuals who are not <strong>authorized</strong> to lead church services, including women, to head a dicastery and become prefects. While the constitutional changes give women more possibilities to serve, they are still not permitted to officially lead church services.</p>
<p>Catholic women already do much of the church's work in schools and hospitals and teach many young members. But Francis has continued a longtime ban on women being local church leaders, called priests. He also does not support women becoming deacons, a position just below a priest.</p>
<p>However, under Pope Francis' leadership, there has been a marked increase in the number of women working in church positions since he was elected in 2013. The <em>Vatican News</em> reports the percentage of women in leadership positions rose from 19.3 percent in 2013 to 23.4 percent today.</p>
<p>Among the women holding high leadership positions are Sister Raffaella Petrini, the first-ever female secretary general of the Vatican City State. She is responsible for the territory's health care system, police force and Vatican Museums.</p>
<p>Another nun, Sister Alessandra Smerilli, is the second-in-command in the church's development office. Several other women have been appointed to under-secretary positions. These include a French nun, Sister Nathalie Becquart, who serves as an advisor to the pope.</p>

            <title>Jimmy Carter Pushed Climate Change Concerns 45 Years Ago  (2025/1/9)</title>

<p>When Jimmy Carter ran for president, he wanted the color green to be used in his campaign instead of red, white and blue.</p>
<p>Green showed up on almost everything related to his campaign. It was meant to show the importance he placed on environmental policy.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 years later, environmental activists celebrate the <strong>legacy</strong> of Carter, who died on December 29 at the age of 100. They say he was concerned about protecting the environment and climate issues.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - President Jimmy Carter speaks against a backdrop of solar panels at the White House, June 21, 1979, in Washington." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/303a18da-47c7-4e3a-bb52-4c0aeb42d9bd_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - President Jimmy Carter speaks against a backdrop of solar panels at the White House, June 21, 1979, in Washington.</span></div>
<p>Manish Bapna leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Bapna said Carter was ahead of his time because he was calling for cuts in gas <strong>emissions</strong> before anyone else was talking about "climate change."</p>
<p><strong>Wearing sweaters and setting standards</strong></p>
<p>Former Vice President Al Gore received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for helping to put the climate crisis on the political <strong>agenda</strong>. Gore called Carter "a lifelong <strong>role model</strong> for the entire environmental movement."</p>
<p>President Carter approved the first U.S. <strong>efficiency</strong> <strong>standards</strong> for passenger vehicles and household <strong>appliances</strong>. He created the U.S. Department of Energy which supported energy research. He more than doubled the amount of wilderness area under National Park Service control.</p>
<p>Carter asked Americans to save energy through personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down their heat in winter during worldwide fuel shortages. He reduced the temperature in the White House in the winter. He wore a <strong>sweater</strong> during his talks to the nation instead of a traditional suit. He pushed renewable energy aiming to reduce dependence on oil and gas.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with climate change</strong></p>
<p>Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a report linking the use of oil, coal and gas, called fossil fuels, to rising <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> levels in Earth's atmosphere. Carter's top environmental advisers urged "immediate" cuts to the burning of carbon fuels to reduce what scientists called "carbon dioxide pollution."</p>
<p>The report called for limiting worldwide average temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Thirty-five years later, the 2015 Paris climate agreement set a similar goal.</p>
<p><strong>The goal of energy independence</strong></p>
<p>Although Carter wanted to depend more on renewable energy, his push toward U.S. energy independence aided the oil industry.</p>
<p>Steven Nadel is head of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He said Carter had the right idea to support research and development organized by the Energy Department.</p>
<p><strong>Stewarding God's creation</strong></p>
<p>Carter's environmental interests began in his boyhood when he hunted and fished and worked on his father's farmland.</p>
<p>Randall Balmer is a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. Balmer has written about Carter's faith, saying Carter saw himself as a caretaker of the natural resources that God created.</p>
<p><strong>Condemning consumerism</strong></p>
<p>Carter won the presidency at a time of energy shortages, partly caused by unrest in the Middle East. Nadel wrote that national security and economic interests came together with Carter's religious beliefs and love of nature.</p>
<p>Carter called the energy crisis "the moral <strong>equivalent</strong> of war." As inflation increased and gasoline shortages spread, Carter called for individual sacrifice and action on renewable energy.</p>
<p>"Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns," Carter said in 1979. He also said: "But we've discovered that owning things and <strong>consuming</strong> things does not satisfy our longing for meaning."</p>
<p>More than 100 million Americans watched Carter's speech. Years later, Carter said it predicted future calls for strong, direct action on energy.</p>
<p>Jay Inslee is the governor of Washington state. Inslee said: "You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today." Inslee ran a 2020 presidential campaign that pushed for climate action. "I've learned in politics that timing is everything,” he noted.</p>

<p>In today's workplace, what you learned in the usual college <strong>courses</strong> may not be very useful later in life.</p>
<p>For example, in the field of information technology, workers might never use BASIC, the computer language that was taught in the 1990s. But they might need to know Python or SQL.</p>
<p>The answer for students or workers is a professional certificate program, or what is called microcredential.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Education Tips: Learn New Skills with Microcredentials" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/59f26be1-5c9b-45c6-bc3e-7467f7ed3ae6_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Education Tips: Learn New Skills with Microcredentials</span></div>
<p><strong>What is microcredential?</strong></p>
<p>UNESCO, the world's education agency, defines microcredential as professional <strong>certification</strong> that centers on a set of learning outcomes in a narrow field. It is completed over a shorter time than a traditional university program, from a week to a month.</p>
<p>The most popular fields in which microcredentials appear are data <strong>analytics</strong>, information technology support and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. The courses are often developed by technology businesses like Google, Salesforce, Meta, Intuit and IBM. The businesses provide a certificate when a student finishes the course.</p>
<p>Coursera, an online educational service, recently released a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.coursera.org/enterprise/resources/pdf/micro-credentials-report-2024-us-pdf">report</a> on how microcredentials are preparing students for jobs and affecting higher education schools. It says that 51 percent of colleges in the United States that offer microcredentials also provide school credit and more plan to do so in the next few years.</p>
<p>Some colleges include one or more courses leading to microcredentials as part of their usual programs. At Hawaii Pacific University, school leaders say including professional certifications in its business program has sharply increased the number of interested students.</p>
<p><strong>How to find the right microcredential?</strong></p>
<p>For students, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://credentialfinder.org/search">Credential Finder</a> offers a way to search for the right microcredential offerings by field of study or industry.</p>

            <title>Do Weighted Blankets Have Health Benefits?  (2025/1/7)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">06 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>When her husband gave her a weighted <strong>blanket</strong> to help her sleep, Rhonda James did not think it would work. In other words, she was skeptical. But five minutes after covering herself with the blanket, she was asleep.</p>
<p>“It felt like a really big <strong>hug</strong>,” said James. She is a banker who lives in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Weighted blankets are on display in a mattress sales showroom in New York City, New York, Dec. 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f00e0efb-fe89-480a-8173-110a81e926d6_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Weighted blankets are on display in a mattress sales showroom in New York City, New York, Dec. 4, 2024.

<p>As temperatures drop, a weighted blanket can be a popular choice to help you keep warm. But some people say the extra pressure of the cover also helps to ease their worries and fall asleep faster.</p>
<p>However, research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets is limited. The Associated Press recently reported on what is known about weighted blankets.</p>
<p><strong>First, what is a weighted blanket?</strong></p>
<p>Weighted blankets are filled with small glass balls,<strong> </strong>cotton or another filling. This makes them heavier than usual blankets.</p>
<p>Scientists may not know exactly how the blankets <strong>comfort</strong>, but they have a few ideas.</p>
<p>The heavy, even feeling from a weighted blanket may calm the brain's fight-or-flight <strong>response</strong>, said Dr. Neal Walia. He is a sleep medicine expert at University of California, Los Angeles Health.</p>
<p>He said, “The evenly <strong>distributed</strong> weight on you tells your body..." you are in a "...calm environment.'”</p>
<p>The extra pressure also may cause the brain to release the hormone oxytocin. Sometimes called the “love hormone,” the body creates oxytocin during loving moments, such as hugging. Oxytocin can also lower <strong>anxiety</strong>, Walia said.</p>
<p><strong>How do you use a weighted blanket?</strong></p>
<p>For most healthy adults, experts say to choose a blanket that is about 10 percent of your body weight.</p>
<p>However, the blankets are not good for everyone.</p>
<p>For example, some people may find them too hot to use, especially during warmer weather.</p>
<p>People with breathing problems or disorders such as sleep apnea should check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket.</p>
<p>Experts say to not use weighted blankets for children under three years old. The weight can limit their movement and breathing.</p>
<p>Some people may not be able to buy them. They can be costly. A quality weighted blankets can cost between $50 to over $300. This depends on the size, weight and material.</p>
<p>Some people use them for other reasons than sleep. Rhonda James gets under her blanket to <strong>relax</strong> as she watches television or drinks a glass of wine.</p>
<p>Lucy Taylor, a writer from Wales, also uses a weighted blanket. Her anxiety increases during the winter. So, she uses her blanket during cold months to fall asleep. She says when her body is relaxed, her mind relaxes too.</p>
<p><strong>Can weighted blankets improve sleep?</strong></p>
<p>There is little scientific research on whether weighted blankets help with sleep, anxiety, or other health issues. The studies that exist involve small groups of people. And most of the study subjects are people with conditions including sleep problems, long-term pain, and mental and developmental disorders.</p>
<p>A study on 120 people with insomnia, an inability to get enough sleep, found that the weighted blankets helped them sleep better compared to a light blanket.</p>
<p>Another study considered 67 children with the developmental and brain disorder autism<strong>.</strong> That research found that weighted blankets did not affect the children's sleep at all. However, it also found that the study subjects liked the weighted blankets more than non-weighted blankets.</p>
<p>A third study on 94 adults with <strong>chronic</strong> pain found that a heavier weighted blanket did not affect sleep. But it was better at reducing pain than a lighter blanket.</p>
<p>So, there is not much scientific evidence to support health improvement claims about weighted blankets. However, in most cases they also cannot hurt, sleep experts say.</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Barone is a sleep medicine expert at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. He suggests the use of weighted blankets to his patients after they try other traditional treatments and medicines.</p>
<p>“If it doesn't hurt and it may help, it's worth a shot,” he said.</p>
<p>And that's the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>

            <title>Buddhist Women in Nepal Practice Kung Fu for Self-Defense, Strength  (2025/1/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Buddhist <strong>nuns</strong> in Nepal are once again performing martial arts for the public after a five-year break caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The women recently put on a show for onlookers at their religious community, called a monastery, outside the capital Kathmandu. The performance was attended by reporters from Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>Members of the hilltop Druk Amitabha Monastery are part of the 1,000-year-old Drukpa religious organization. The group gives nuns equal status to male community members called monks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Kung Fu nun demonstrates her skills during the reopening of the nun's center at Druk Amitabha Mountain Nunnery in Kathmandu, Nepal Dec. 30, 2024." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/ec64e9c2-cd4d-4365-a497-d789cea521a1_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A Kung Fu nun demonstrates her skills during the reopening of the nun's center at Druk Amitabha Mountain Nunnery in Kathmandu, Nepal Dec. 30, 2024.</span></div>
<p>The Drukpa lineage includes the only female <strong>order</strong> in the male-led Buddhist monastery system. The nun community was established in 2009 and now has 300 members between the ages of six and 54.</p>
<p>The nuns come from Bhutan, India and Nepal. They are all trained in kung fu, the ancient Chinese style martial art that promotes self-defense and strength.</p>
<p>In their recent performance, the nuns were seen moving their hands quickly and kicking their legs high, with some holding swords. Hundreds of people gathered to watch the performance and cheered the group on.</p>
<p>Usually, such religious organizations expect nuns to cook and clean and not practice any form of martial arts. But one monk, Gyalwang Drukpa, decided to train women in kung fu to improve their health and spiritual well-being. He has a position just slightly below the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan Buddhist leadership.</p>
<p>Jigme Jangchub Chosdon is a 23-year-old nun who came from Ladakh in India. She told Reuters, “We do kung fu to keep ourselves mentally and physically fit, and our aim is to promote women's empowerment and gender equality."</p>
<p>Another performer was 24-year-old Jigme Yangchen Gamo, a nun from Ramechhap in Nepal. She said, "With the <strong>confidence</strong> from kung fu, I really want to help the community, young girls to build their own strength."</p>
<p>The nuns' website explains that the combination of gender equality, physical strength and respect for all living things represents the order's return to its "true spiritual roots."</p>
<p>In the past, the nuns have traveled long distances on foot and by bike in the Himalayas to raise money for disaster relief and to promote environment-friendly living.</p>
<p>Another member of the group is Jigme Konchok Lhamo, a 30-year-old nun from India. She said her main goal for the future is to reach <strong>enlightenment</strong> like Lord Buddha, who founded Buddhism 2,600 years ago.</p>
<p>She added, "But for now as I am a normal person... I think I will be focusing more on helping others. Helping others is our religion."</p>

<p>The <strong>impeachment </strong>late last month of South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo has deepened political division in the country. He had replaced President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached earlier in December.</p>
<p>Two impeachments suspending the country's top two officials in a short period of time has never happened before in South Korea. Now, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, is the new temporary leader.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Wreaths sent by supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol are displayed outside the Constitutional Court in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Dec. 27, 2024.

<span class="imagecaption">Wreaths sent by supporters of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol are displayed outside the Constitutional Court in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Dec. 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)</span></div>
<p>When he took power, Choi quickly ordered the military to increase readiness in the event of an act of aggression by North Korea. Diplomats communicated with important partners including the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>Duyeon Kim is an expert with the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. Kim said: “(Han's) impeachment now creates an <strong>opportunity </strong>for<strong> external</strong> threats.”</p>
<p><strong>How Han was impeached</strong></p>
<p>Before Yoon declared martial law on December 3, Han Duck-soo was the prime minister and the second highest official in South Korea. Lawmakers impeached Yoon on December 14 over his martial law order.</p>
<p>Han tried to ease the concerns of South Korea's major diplomatic partners and to calm its financial markets. However, he became involved in a political dispute with the opposition Democratic Party, or DP.</p>
<p>DP lawmakers demanded that Han immediately appoint three justices to seats on the Constitutional Court to rule on Yoon's impeachment. The court normally has nine justices. Currently three seats remain open. Han refused to fill the open seats. He said he would not appoint justices without the approval of both the DP and the governing People Power Party, or PPP.</p>
<p>Choi Jin is director of the Institute of Presidential Leadership based in Seoul. He said Han lacked a good reason not to appoint the justices. But Choi said the DP should not have moved to impeach Han so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>International surprise</strong></p>
<p>Han's impeachment came as South Korean officials told international partners that the situation was returning to normal. Officials in Japan, Europe and the United States had been surprised by Yoon's declaration of martial law.</p>
<p>Duyeon Kim said: “South Korea is now in a far more serious crisis of leadership and governance,” adding that, “Han had the experience and <strong>credentials</strong> to deal with both security and financial crises....”</p>
<p>Kim expressed concern that the leadership situation would harm the economy, culture and industry.</p>
<p><strong>What might happen?</strong></p>
<p>The governing party argues that Han's impeachment is “<strong>invalid</strong>” because it is based on a simple majority of the 300-member National Assembly. The PPP says a two-thirds majority is necessary. It has brought a case before the Constitutional Court to consider the impeachment vote of Yoon.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court has 180 days to decide on the legality of both impeachments.<br/>
<br/>
Han called his impeachment “regrettable,” but said he respects the assembly's decision. If Yoon is ousted, then a national election must take place within 60 days.</p>
<p>Yoon faces several separate investigations into possible wrongdoing linked to his martial law declaration. DP leader Lee Jae-myung is favored to win a possible presidential election.</p>
<p>However, Lee faces legal cases as well. He was found guilty of election law violations in November. He is appealing the ruling.<br/>
<br/>
If Lee becomes president, his trials would be suspended because South Korean law does not permit a sitting president to face legal action for most crimes.</p>

<p>As we enter the new year, we take a look back at some of the biggest space stories of 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Historic private moon landing</strong></p>
<p>Nearly one year ago, a private spacecraft completed the first U.S. moon landing in more than 50 years. The American space agency NASA announced the space lander, called Odysseus, had touched down on the lunar surface February 22.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by Intuitive Machines shows its Odysseus lunar lander over the near side of the moon following lunar orbit insertion, Feb. 21, 2024. The lander guided itself to the surface Feb. 22." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0a00-0242-ae7d-08dc34065d95_cx0_cy15_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by Intuitive Machines shows its Odysseus lunar lander over the near side of the moon following lunar orbit insertion, Feb. 21, 2024. The lander guided itself to the surface Feb. 22.</span></div>
<p>Odysseus was developed by the Texas-based company Intuitive Machines. The spacecraft carried out several science experiments before powering down permanently on the moon in late March.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-accelerates-space-exploration-earth-science-for-all-in-2024/#:~:text=With%20a%20look%20back%20at,study%20Jupiter's%20icy%20moon%20Europa%3B">said</a> Odysseus had successfully captured data to help the agency “better understand the moon's environment and improve landing <strong>precision</strong> and safety.”</p>
<p><strong>Japanese moon landing</strong></p>
<p>Japan's space agency JAXA announced in January 2024 that its SLIM spacecraft had successfully landed on the moon. But the lander touched down the wrong way up, causing some communication and power problems.</p>
<p>Japanese space officials <a class="wsw__a" href="https://global.jaxa.jp/press/2024/08/20240826-1_e.html">reported</a> that they stayed in communication with SLIM through late April. They said the spacecraft was able to collect valuable data about the touchdown and surrounding area.</p>
<p>One purpose of the mission was to demonstrate new <strong>precision</strong> landing technology. JAXA said the experiment was successful because SLIM was able to land within 10 meters of its planned target.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese moon landing and return</strong></p>
<p>In May, China launched its Chang'e 6 spacecraft to the moon's far side. In late June, Chinese space officials announced the spacecraft had returned to Earth with rock and soil <strong>samples</strong> collected on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>The successful return made China the first country to ever collect and bring back lunar samples from the far side of the moon. The area is known as the far side because it always faces away from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Europe's asteroid exploration mission</strong></p>
<p>In October, the European Space Agency (ESA) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/europe-launches-spacecraft-to-explore-asteroid-hit-by-nasa/7818115.html">said</a> it had successfully launched a spacecraft, called Hera, to explore an <strong>asteroid</strong> struck in an earlier NASA test <strong>mission</strong>. Hera's trip to the asteroid is expected to take about two years.</p>
<p>Hera is headed to the asteroid Dimorphos. NASA crashed its DART spacecraft into the space rock in 2022, about 11 million kilometers from Earth. NASA said its mission successfully showed it was possible to change the orbit of asteroids that might threaten Earth in the future.</p>
<p>Hera aims to closely examine Dimorphos to get more details on how the strike by DART affected the asteroid. The data that NASA collected is to be used together with information gathered by ESA to develop future planetary defense plans.</p>
<p><strong>Europa Clipper to explore Jupiter's moon</strong></p>
<p>NASA announced the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/nasas-europa-clipper-millions-of-miles-down-instruments-deploying/">successful launch</a> of its Europa Clipper spacecraft in October. The explorer is designed to search for possible signs of life on Jupiter's moon Europa.</p>
<p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and has numerous moons. But icy Europa has been identified by scientists as a good candidate for having the right conditions to support life. Several studies have suggested the moon likely contains a large ocean beneath its icy surface.</p>
<p>NASA said the Europa Clipper would fly past Mars, then back toward Earth, “using the gravity of each planet to increase its <strong>momentum</strong>.” These kinds of “gravity assists” are expected to provide the needed push to get the spacecraft to Jupiter by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Boeing's crew flight to the ISS</strong></p>
<p>In early June, Boeing successfully carried out a test mission for NASA by transporting two American astronauts – Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams – to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
<p>The two were expected to stay in space for only a week. But ongoing technical issues with the Starliner spacecraft prevented a return trip.</p>
<p>NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/">announced</a> plans in August to have Starliner return to Earth without the astronauts. The current plan is for Wilmore and Williams to return on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft sometime in late March or April.</p>
<p><strong>SpaceX landing demonstration</strong></p>
<p>SpaceX has now completed six launch tests of its huge Starship rocket system. Four of those tests were carried out in 2024. The last test took place in November.</p>
<p>The Starship rocket and spacecraft system is designed to be a completely reusable vehicle to transport astronauts and supplies. It has successfully demonstrated that ability in its most recent experimental flights.</p>
<p>During one of the tests in October, Starship's Super Heavy <strong>booster</strong> rocket was <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/spacex-calls-new-starship-test-a-success-captures-rocket-at-landing/7824353.html">"caught“ and secured</a> by a huge structure that includes metal arms. A short time later, Starship's second <strong>stage</strong> safely <strong>splashed down</strong> in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>One of the most popular sports in the United States is American football. In the U.S., “football” is a sport that involves a lot of contact. What people around the world call “football,” Americans call soccer.</p>
<p>For today's show, we talk about some <strong>idioms</strong> and expressions that come from American football.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Las Vegas Raiders kick off to the New Orleans Saints to start an NFL football game, Monday, Sept. 21, 2020, in Las Vegas.

<p>The American sport mainly involves carrying or throwing the ball. But there are times when a player must use their feet to kick the ball. The kicker can kick <strong>field goals</strong> to get points. In addition to that, the game starts with a <strong>kickoff</strong> and, after scoring points, a team will kick off to the other side, beginning their turn on offense.</p>
<p><strong>Kicks and punts</strong></p>
<p>The term <u>kickoff</u> is commonly used to describe the start of an event or project. For example, we could say experts from all over the world attended the kickoff of the new language museum.</p>
<p>You can use it as a phrasal verb, as well. For example, people often like to “kick off” the new year with a resolution, or promise to yourself, to reach a goal or to do something.</p>
<p>Football also has the term “punt.” Punting is another sort of kick a team uses when they cannot score. The punter kicks a ball with the top of his foot. “Punt,” like “kick,” can be both a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>When you punt the ball, you put it in play for the other team. The same can be said for punting in life. When we punt something, we give our task, job, or responsibility to someone else. For example, if I'm not good at a certain task or I just don't want to do it, I can <u>punt</u> it to someone else.</p>
<p>It can also mean <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_wnKZgr9H">to delay</a> a decision. If I'm not sure about taking a trip, for example, I can punt the decision until later. Another way to say this in American English is to <u>table</u> it. If you are not ready to think about something, it can or must wait until later.</p>
<p>In football, the kicker not only starts the game with a kickoff but also kicks field goals. To do this, the kicker must kick the football between the <strong>goalposts </strong>at either end of the football field. If he succeeds, his team gets three points.</p>
<p>Kicking a field goal can be difficult if the kicker is far from the goalposts or if the weather in an outdoor <strong>stadium </strong>is windy, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_JPUiMEq5">rainy</a> or snowy.</p>
<p>But imagine if the goalposts were moving? That would make kicking the ball between them much more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>To move the goalposts</strong></p>
<p>We can face this problem in everyday life. Imagine if you are given a task at work with specific goals to reach. For example, if you are a social media manager you could be asked to increase followers by 10,000 by the end of the month. But when the end of the month comes, your boss tells you that now you need to add 20,000 followers, not 10,000.</p>
<p>In this case, your boss has moved the goalpost.</p>
<p>Sometime a person moves the goalposts on purpose. They have a reason for doing so. If the goalposts keep moving, it is difficult or even impossible to reach the goal. So, if you say that someone has “moved the goalposts,” you are accusing them of changing the rules or end goals to make it difficult for you to succeed.</p>
<p>We can also say <u>to move the target</u> to mean the same thing. A <u>moving target</u> is a changing goal or result. A desired goal, end, or objective that changes all the time is difficult or perhaps even impossible to reach.</p>
<p>Both expressions – to move the goalposts and to move the target – can be used in the same way and in similar situations. However, <u>moving the goalposts</u> is a <strong>classic</strong> football expression. While <u>moving the target</u> can <strong>refer</strong> to several sports.</p>

            <title>Bosnia's ‘Balkan Blues’ Music Honored by UNESCO  (2025/1/4)</title>

<p>Every Friday, musician Enes Salman performs the Sevdalinka, an ancient form of love song from Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Sevdalinka was recently included in UNESCO's National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. UNESCO is The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.</p>
<p>Sevdalinka is often called the Balkan Blues. It is a somewhat sad form of urban love song that dates to the 1500s. It is a mix of South Slavic spoken poetry and music of the Ottoman Empire.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Bosnian musician Enes Salman plays the accordion while performing the traditional love song Sevdalinka, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 20, 2024.

<p>Salman is among only a few musicians keeping the tradition alive.</p>
<p>"I have been playing and singing Sevdalinka since I was 14," he said before a recent performance.</p>
<p>Sevdalinka is often performed <strong>a cappella</strong>. That means it is sung without musical instruments. Sometimes the performer sings with traditional instruments like a lute. This form, or <strong>genre</strong>, of music has been carried from generation to generation through performances at family gatherings.</p>
<p>In recent years, younger musicians have brought modern versions of Sevdalinka to <strong>audiences</strong> around the world.</p>
<p>One of them is Damir Imamovic. His father and grandfather were famous Sevdalinka performers. In 2020 and 2021, Imamovic won awards from two world music publications, <em>Songlines</em> and <em>Transglobal</em>, for best European album.</p>
<p>Imamovic supports Sevdalinka internationally through his SevdahLab project. The project helped build support for the music's inclusion on UNESCO's World Heritage list.</p>
<p>"I realized how little the public knows about the Sevdalinka genre<strong> </strong>and wanted to <strong>reveal </strong>the story behind that music," he said.</p>
<p>Zanin Berbic is a 28-year-old <strong>ethno-musicologist</strong>. He works as a <strong>curator </strong>in the music department of Bosnia's Regional Museum in Sarajevo, organizing, protecting, and bringing attention to music. He also plays saz, a long-necked lute used in Ottoman classical music. He said that Sevdalinka tells the story of Bosnia's history.</p>
<p>Berbic said, "Most of my days I spend either singing or playing Sevdalinka songs or reading or talking about them. Sevdalinka is my life," he said.</p>
