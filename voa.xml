        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Important Terms and Ideas for Describing Artificial Intelligence  (2025/2/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202502/important-terms-and-ideas-involved-in-describing-artificial-intelligence.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">12 February, 2025</span><br/>
<p>There are several terms experts use to describe computer systems in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Recently, the French News Agency (AFP) defined some of the common terms and ideas used in that field.</p>
<p>Here is a version for English learners:</p><div class="contentImage"><img act="" ai="" alt="FILE - A copy of " artificial="" at="" big="" britain="" data="" display="" during="" european="" expo="" february="" in="" infantes="" intelligence="" isabel="" london="" olympia="" on="" reuters="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/aeda1905-020d-4606-b3e9-ae4b0ccd1d81_w268_r1.jpg" the="" union=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A copy of "The European Union Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act" on display during the AI &amp; Big Data Expo 2025 at the Olympia, in London, Britain, February 5, 2025. REUTERS/Isabel Infantes</span></div>
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence </strong></p>
<p>The first term is “artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>When asked what artificial intelligence is, the AI-powered ChatGPT system says that the term means “the<strong> simulation</strong> of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn and make decisions".</p>
<p>AI's main quality or characteristic is taking in large amounts of data and then processing it using methods from <strong>statistics</strong>.</p>
<p>AI involves using ideas from many fields including computing, mathematics, languages, psychology, and others.</p>
<p>Currently, the technology is being used heavily for investigating health issues, translating human languages, and predicting problems in machine tools and self-driving cars. But AI is affecting many fields of business and industry.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm </strong></p>
<p>A second important term is “algorithm.”</p>
<p>An algorithm is important to all computer operations. It is a series of steps or instructions followed by a computer program to get a result.</p>
<p>Algorithms can give rules for an AI's behavior, helping it to realize the objectives of computer program developers.</p>
<p>Unlike a simple computer program, AI algorithms permit a computer system to “learn” for itself.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning </strong></p>
<p>A third important term is “machine learning.”</p>
<p>Machine learning is one method that researchers have used in their efforts to produce artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Machine learning lets computers learn from data without being directly programmed on what results to produce.</p>
<p>In recent years, the field of <strong>neural</strong> networks has given important results.</p>
<p>In a neural network, connections between some <strong>nodes </strong>are strengthened and others weakened as the system learns and makes changes.</p>
<p>Learning can be "supervised." This means the system learns to put new data into specific groups based on a model. For example, the system could learn to identify <strong>spam</strong> in an email or other messaging programs.</p>
<p>"Unsupervised" learning permits the system to independently discover new areas or ways of doing things. These discoveries in the available data might not have been immediately clear.</p>
<p>An example would be letting an online store identify buying<strong> trends </strong>in sales data.</p>
<p>"Reinforcement" learning adds a process of repeated trial-and-error. In this process, the system is rewarded based on its outcomes, causing it to learn and improve.</p>
<p>One example might be a self-driving vehicle whose objective is to reach its destination as quickly as possible but also safely. That requirement would lead it to learn to stop at red lights although it requires additional time.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning </strong></p>
<p>Deep learning owes its name to its use of many layers of neural networks.</p>
<p>Raw data is examined by each layer in turn at growing levels of <strong>abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Hinton received the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics. Hinton is credited with developing deep learning. Hinton received the prize along with 1980s neural-network developer John Hopfield.</p>
<p>Francis Bach, head of France's SIERRA statistical learning laboratory, said this about deep learning: "The more layers you have, the more complex behavior can become, and the more complex the behavior can be, the easier it is to learn a desired behavior <strong>efficiently</strong>."</p>
<p>The method might help lead to scientific discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Language models </strong></p>
<p>We now turn to large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>These might be the most popular example of generative AI. Large language models power tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini.</p>
<p>Such systems are able to write long papers, answer legal questions or even produce a cake recipe based on their statistical models.</p>
<p>But the technology is still new. LLM's can suffer from "hallucinations"- the creation of content that is false or incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>Artificial general intelligence </strong></p>
<p>A final important term is artificial general intelligence (AGI) - one the big goals of the whole AI field.</p>
<p>AGI suggests the unrealized dream of a machine able to reproduce all human processes of human thinking.</p>
<p>People who push the idea include OpenAI chief Sam Altman and his competitors at Anthropic. They consider such a system to be within reach.</p>
<p>The goal is to use large amounts of data and processing power to train LLMs that are increasingly powerful.</p>
<p>But critics say that LLM technology has important limits, including its ability to reason.</p>
<p>Maxime Amblard, computing professor at France's University of Lorraine, told AFP last year, "LLMs do not work like human beings."</p>
<p>Amblard added that humans, as flesh-and-blood -intelligent beings, are "sense-making machines" with different abilities from today's computer systems.</p>

            <title>Cambodia Warns of ‘Aggressive’ Monkeys around Angkor Wat  (2025/2/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">12 February, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Cambodian officials are warning visitors to the nation's famous Angkor Wat complex of buildings to stay away from wild m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s. They say the animals have become aggressive and destructive.</p>
<p>The officials blamed the behavior of the macaque m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s on visitors to the area who feed the animals or interact with them.</p>
<p>Social media influencers – many of them on YouTube – use video of the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s to grow their online followings, the officials added.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="YouTuber Phut Phu takes videos of m&lt;I&gt;&lt;I&gt;onkey&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;s near the Bayon temple of an Angkor Wat temple complex in Siem Reap province, Cambodia, Tuesday, April 2, 2024.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith)</span></div>
<p>The macaques are native to forest areas surrounding Angkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in northwestern Cambodia. The m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s have become more destructive of property around the popular <strong>tourist</strong> area.</p>
<p>Officials watching the animals told the French News Agency, AFP, that too much human interaction – especially by people filming material to publish online – had changed the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s' behavior.</p>
<p>The agency that operates Angkor Wat is the APSARA National Authority. It said in a statement that a small number of YouTubers repeatedly feed the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s to create videos. This "changed the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s' natural behavior from being wild animals to <strong>domestic</strong> ones that are aggressive, steal food, and cause injuries among people."</p>
<p>Agency spokesman Long Kosal told AFP that officials also worry about the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s causing damage to stonework that dates back centuries. "On top of biting visitors, they have been climbing up and pushing stones down, damaging temples," he said. Some macaques had also damaged information signs.</p>
<p>Local officials have urged tourists to leave the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s alone while visiting Angkor Wat. They added that they are currently looking for "an <strong>appropriate</strong> solution" to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Angkor Wat was the capital of the Khmer Empire. Building work began on the complex about 900 years ago. It remains Cambodia's top tourist site and earns a lot of money for the developing nation. More than one million foreign tourists visited the area last year.</p>
<p>Since becoming a world heritage site in 1992, Angkor Wat and the surrounding forest have received increased legal protection and security.</p>
<p>Officials have expressed hope that wildlife sightings around Angkor Wat will increase visitor interest and support <strong>conservation</strong> education efforts.</p>
<p>Last year, Cambodian officials announced a plan to carry out a <strong>census</strong> of m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s in public areas to identify and take away those presenting a danger to humans.</p>

            <title>George Washington – the First President  (2025/2/13)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>George Washington was the first president of the United States. He served from 1789 to 1797. He was a famous general who led the American colonists to freedom from British rule and he <strong>presided</strong> over the convention that created the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>He wanted to retire from public service and return home. But the country's founders wanted him to move to New York and serve as the American president. Washington accepted the job as his duty.</p>
<p>Washington was sworn in as president in 1789. He had to invent the job of being president for all future presidents. He established a group of advisors — called the cabinet—as well as the nation's official money. He appointed a six-member Supreme Court. And he created the Department of Foreign Affairs, now called the State Department. He hoped to act in such a way that future presidents could continue to build on what he began.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Martha and George Washington with their grandchildren.

Courtesy George Washington's Mount Vernon.</span></div>
<p>From the beginning, George Washington was careful to establish a good working relationship with Congress. By his actions, he confirmed the separation of powers of the three <strong>branches</strong> of the government, as described in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Historian Joseph Ellis says one of the best things about George Washington was his ability to give up power. At the end of the Revolutionary War, General Washington returned his sword. And at the end of his second term, President Washington simply returned home.</p>
<p>Like many plantation owners, Washington was a slave holder. By the end of his life, Washington opposed slavery. He left a <strong>will</strong> ordering his survivors to free his slaves after his wife's death.</p>
<p>Three years after he finished his second term as president, Washington fell ill. On December 14, 1799, he died in his bed, surrounded by his wife, enslaved maids, and friends. He was 67.</p>

            <title>American Inventions: The Television  (2025/2/12)</title>

<p>Television has made it possible for people around the world to share in many different experiences – sports, music shows, films, and more.</p>
<p>Yet many people would find it difficult to name the inventor of the television. They might also be surprised to learn that the inventor came up with the idea when he was just fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Today, we explore the life of one of the great inventors of 20th century America: Philo Taylor Farnsworth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A shopper passes by a line of large-screen televisions on display in a Costco warehouse, Feb. 3, 2025, in east Denver.

<p><strong>A young boy </strong></p>
<p>Philo Farnsworth was born in August 1906, near Indian Creek in the western state of Utah. The house he lived in for the first few years of his life had no electricity. But Philo read about electricity and quickly began to experiment with it.</p>
<p>One night, Philo read a magazine story about the idea of sending pictures and sound through the air. The story said some of the world's best scientists were working on the idea. It said these scientists were using special machines to try to make a kind of device to send pictures.</p>
<p>Fourteen-year-old Philo decided these famous scientists were wrong. He decided that mechanical devices would never work.</p>
<p>Philo believed such a device would have to be electronic. Philo knew electrons could be made to move very fast. All he would have to do was find a way to make electrons do the work.</p>
<p>Soon, Philo had an idea for such a receiver. It would trap light in a container and send the light on a line of electrons. Philo called it “light in a bottle.”</p>
<p>Several days later, Philo told his teacher about a device that could capture pictures. He drew a plan for it and gave it to his teacher.</p>
<p>Philo's drawing seemed very simple. But it still clearly showed the information needed to build a television.</p>
<p>Philo's teacher was Justin Tolman. Many years later, Philo would credit Mr. Tolman with guiding his imagination and helping him open the doors of science.</p>
<p><strong>Inventor </strong></p>
<p>In September 1927, Philo turned on a device that was the first working television receiver. In another room was the first television camera. Philo had invented the special camera tube earlier that year.</p>
<p>While the image produced on the receiver was not very clear, the device worked. Within a few months, Philo had found several people who wanted to invest money in his invention.</p>
<p>In August 1930, the United States government gave Philo patent documents. These documents aimed to protect his invention from being copied by others.</p>
<p>Still, he became involved in legal disputes with a powerful company at the time known as RCA. Philo won the disputes but faced many business and financial difficulties in his life.</p>
<p>He developed more than 100 devices that helped make modern television possible. He also developed early radar, invented the first electronic microscope, and worked on developing peaceful uses of atomic energy.</p>
<p>Philo Farnsworth died in March of 1971. He is considered one of the most important inventors of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Carlene Thomas is a dietitian, a person who gives advice about healthy foods to eat.</p>
<p>When it comes to eating healthy vegetables, Thomas says there are two kinds of people who ask her for advice.</p>
<p>The first kind wants to know how different cooking methods affect the nutrition in vegetables. The other kind of person wants to know how to eat more vegetables. Thomas' simple answer to both groups is this: The best vegetables are the ones you actually want to eat.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this April 24, 2014 file photo, a variety of healthy fruits and vegetables are displayed for sale at a market in Washington.

Scott Applewhite, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3cfac617-78de-4660-9dc6-f89b4e910992_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this April 24, 2014 file photo, a variety of healthy fruits and vegetables are displayed for sale at a market in Washington.

<p>Thomas told the Associated Press that many people buy vegetables that they <em>think </em>they will eat. Maybe the <strong>produce</strong> is popular or someone is bringing attention to it on social media. But then they end up not using it. That means the vegetable gets thrown away after it goes bad.</p>
<p>In that case, Thomas said, “It doesn't matter how you cook them, because if they're going in the trash, they're not in your body.”</p>
<p>However, Thomas said research shows cooking methods do affect nutrition. But it is not as simple as comparing raw, or uncooked, vegetables to cooked ones. Cooking methods can include steaming, <strong>roasting</strong>, boiling, or <strong>sauteing</strong>.</p>
<p>So, are raw vegetables healthier than cooked? Not always.</p>
<p>When vegetables are cooked with high heat for a long period of time many nutrients break down. However, cooking softens the cell walls in vegetables, making them easier for the body to <strong>digest</strong>.</p>
<p>Cooking changes the structure of vegetables which increases what dietitians call bioavailability. This is the body's ability to use the nutrients in vegetables, Thomas said.</p>
<p>Cooked food is often more nutritious than raw food. For example, cooked tomatoes release more of the <strong>antioxidant</strong> lycopene than raw tomatoes, she said. Lycopene is believed to have qualities that prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Also, cooked carrots have more beta-carotene that can be <strong>absorbed</strong> by the body. Roasting pumpkins, carrots and sweet potatoes increases available carotenoids. These antioxidants are thought to prevent <strong>inflammation</strong> in the body.</p>
<p><strong>Which cooking methods are the healthiest?</strong></p>
<p>However, the shorter the cooking time, the more nutrients are kept in the food. That advice comes from Amber Pankonin, a dietitian in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</p>
<p>Cooking over boiling water, or steaming, and in a microwave are considered the most nutritious methods. These two methods use little time and require no fat.</p>
<p>Another healthy method is <strong>blanching</strong>. This is when you boil vegetables in water for a minute or two. But not too long. Boiling vegetables runs the risk of losing <strong>water-soluble</strong> nutrients including vitamin C, B1 and folate.</p>
<p>Thomas explained the reason boiling is not good for vegetables: The nutrients are "... <strong>leaching </strong>into the water, and you're <strong>tossing out</strong> the water.”</p>
<p>However, you could save the water from boiled vegetables and use it for other purposes, such as soups, or just drink it.</p>
<p><strong>What about taste?</strong></p>
<p>Dietitians say there is no problem using a small amount of fat. Besides making vegetables taste better, a little cooking oil helps the body to absorb fat-soluble vitamins, said Pankonin.</p>
<p>That means more vitamin A from squash, carrots, and sweet potatoes; more vitamin D from mushrooms; more vitamin E from bell peppers, leafy greens and asparagus; and more vitamin K from greens, broccoli and onions.</p>
<p>For <strong>pan</strong> frying or sauteing, Pankonin suggests cooking with enough oil so the vegetables do not stick to the pan. The amount of oil will depend on the quantity of vegetables and the size of the pan.</p>
<p>For roasting, you will likely need more oil. Despite the longer cooking time, roasting will still keep some nutrients and will increase the <strong>flavor</strong> with the heating of natural sugars.</p>
<p>“Flavor is king,” Pankonin said. “I would much rather see people roasting their vegetables and enjoying them.”</p>

            <title>Teachers Use Games for More Enjoyable Learning  (2025/2/12)</title>

<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/6425558.html">Wordle</a> has become one of the most popular online games in the United States since it came out last October.</p>
<p>Players get six chances to <strong>guess</strong> and learn a five-letter word for the day. Many are sharing their game results on social media, adding more interest in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Gamifying the classroom</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Teachers Use Games for More Enjoyable Learning" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/02280000-0aff-0242-d93c-08da010b9608_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Teachers Use Games for More Enjoyable Learning</span></div>
<p>Creative teachers have long found games could make their classes more enjoyable for students. During the pandemic, many have looked for new ways or games to help their students learn. It is part of a learning theory called “<strong>gamification</strong>” to keep students' interest.</p>
<p>Beyond Wordle, here are other games that help learners with different subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematics</strong></p>
<p>British data scientist Richard Mann of London was talking with his daughter about the popularity of Wordle. He thought there should be a game for people who like mathematics and developed <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nerdlegame.com/">Nerdle</a>. It is a daily game in which a player has six tries to guess a math solution.</p>
<p>Does it sound familiar? Math teachers note that a Nerdle player uses logic, a careful way of thinking about something, to solve a math problem. It is similar to how a Wordle player applies logic to guess a word.</p>
<p><strong>Geography</strong></p>
<p>Do not <strong>confuse</strong> Wordle with <a class="wsw__a" href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/">Worldle</a>. There is an extra letter ‘l” in Worldle. French video game developer Antoine Teuf said he invented Worldle in honor of that word game, Wordle.</p>
<p>Players guess a country based on its shape. They get six tries to guess a country based on information about the country. Teuf first shared the game on January 22. He said there are two million visits a day to the game's page a month later.</p>
<p><strong>Other games, online services</strong></p>
<p>Teachers of English see word games as a way for students to learn new words. Other word games include Blooket and Flippity.</p>
<p>Teachers create quizzes in <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.blooket.com/">Blooket</a> similar to the kinds of games students play on mobile devices. They can look at results and see areas that students can improve.</p>
<p>In <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.flippity.net/">Flippity</a>, teachers can create flash cards, <strong>rewards</strong>, spelling <strong>quizzes</strong>, memory games and word searches from a simple Google <strong>spreadsheet. </strong>It is also a good tool for students to create their own projects.</p>
<p>There are several online services that teachers could use to “gamify” learning. They include <a class="wsw__a" href="https://kahoot.com/">Kahoot!,</a> <a class="wsw__a" href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, <u><a class="wsw__a" href="https://quizizz.com/">Quizziz</a></u> and <a class="wsw__a" href="https://nearpod.com/">Nearpod</a>. All of them “gamify” learning by creating competition among learners while reviewing the content presented by teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching without a computer?</strong></p>
<p>In many places, teachers and students do not have a computer. So, English language teacher Larry Ferlazzo asked them to share their language-learning games. Ferlazzo wrote about them in his <a class="wsw__a" href="https://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2011/06/05/the-best-language-learning-games-that-are-not-online/">blog</a>. Here are two of the games that teachers suggested:</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://kelaskubermain.blogspot.com/">Danielle Horne</a> teaches at Helena College in Glen Forrest, Western Australia. She said one of the games that her students love playing is “hot or cold.”</p>
<p>In “hot or cold,” students hide something in the classroom while a student, or searcher, is waiting outside. The students then say a word, phrase, or sentence. They get louder when the searcher gets nearer to the object and softer when the searcher is more distant. Horne said to be prepared for quite a bit of noise though!</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.111variation.dk/">Eva Pors</a> is a Danish high school teacher. Her students play “questions and answers” to learn new words or vocabulary.</p>
<p>Pors write words or phrases on small pieces of paper and divides students into groups of four. Within a group, student A picks a piece of paper with a word or phrase on it and asks questions that will make student B say the exact word or phrase on the paper.</p>
<p>For example, with the word “milk,” Student A would ask, “What do you put on your <strong>cereal</strong> in the morning?” Student B has one minute to try to answer as many words or phrases as possible. The other two students in the group will then take over for one minute. And the team with the most correct guesses wins the game.</p>

            <title>The Paradox Museum Miami Aims to Trick the Eye  (2025/2/12)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://paradoxmuseummiami.com/" target="_blank">Paradox Museum Miami</a> is a mixture of art, science, and fun.</p>
<p>The 1,000-square-meter <strong>museum</strong> is housed in Miami's Wynwood arts and <strong>entertainment</strong> area. It has more than 70 public displays known as exhibits. Executive director Samantha Impellizeri says these exhibits <strong>challenge</strong> the imagination.</p>
<p>She added that visitors can walk away from the experience with some really fun and interesting material for social media.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A group of friends pose for a picture that will be rotated upside down to create an optical illusion, at Paradox Museum Miami, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in Miami. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6089c788-f5f8-452a-8e5b-dc984ca18a7e_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A group of friends pose for a picture that will be rotated upside down to create an optical illusion, at Paradox Museum Miami, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, in Miami.

<p>Paradox Museum has more than ten <strong>locations</strong> throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Miami location, which opened in 2022, was the first in North America.</p>
<p>The term paradox is central to the museum and what visitors experience. A paradox is a situation or thing that has seemingly opposite or contradictory qualities.</p>
<p>“Each paradox is uniquely tied to its community,” Impellizeri said. “So as you walk throughout the experience, you'll notice different <strong>themes</strong> and art <strong>installations </strong>that directly reflect not only Miami but the Wynwood community specifically."</p>
<p>Many of the displays at Paradox Museum suggest old carnival funhouses – buildings that had devices and rooms designed to surprise or amaze visitors.</p>
<p>Examples include the mirror maze, the spinning tunnel, and the upside-down room. The difference is that Paradox Museum explains the math and science behind each<strong> illusion</strong>.</p>
<p>“We're a top field trip destination for <strong>pre-K</strong> all the way up through college students,” Impellizeri said. She added that the museum has a large number of educational activities that students can do before, during, and after the visit.</p>
<p>Like any museum, Paradox Museum plans to change its exhibits to keep visitors coming back.</p>
<p>“We're not going to be the same space in a year to three years from now," Impellizeri said.</p>
<p>Paradox Museum Miami introduced a new Zero Gravity Room last fall. Visitors can turn their smart phone cameras on and attach their phones to a spinning holder. Then they step into a large, slowly moving room designed to look like the inside of a space station. The resulting video makes it look as though they are walking up the wall and ceiling inside a room unaffected by gravity.</p>
<p>Paradox Museum is part of a movement towards so-called “<strong>immersive</strong> art experiences.” These kinds of art experiences often use technology to make the visitors feel like they are taking part in art rather than just looking at it.</p>
<p>“Immersive experiences around the world are increasing in popularity,” Impellizeri noted.</p>
<p>Immersive art experiences have opened all over the world during the past 10 years or so. Examples include a company called <a class="wsw__a" href="https://meowwolf.com/" target="_blank">Meow Wolf</a> with several locations in the western United States, as well as a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://vangoghexpo.com/" target="_blank">Van Gogh exhibit</a> that has been traveling through North America, Europe and Asia since 2017. Superblue Miami, which opened in 2021, is another example.</p>
<p>Visitors generally take 60 to 90 minutes to make their way through Paradox Museum. Tickets normally cost $26 for adults and teenagers and $20 for children.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Facundo Ildarraz and his family came to Miami from Argentina. Ildarraz said his mother found Paradox Museum online. He said it turned out to be a great chance to take fun photos with his family.</p>
<p>“I've been laughing since I went inside,” Ildarraz said. “It's really amazing.”</p>
<p>Dennis Speigel is head of a business advisory company called <a class="wsw__a" href="http://www.interthemepark.com/" target="_blank">International Theme Park Services, Inc.</a> Speigel said immersive experiences are a natural progression of location-based entertainment. Location-based entertainment includes go-cart tracks, laser tag, paint ball, indoor skydiving, escape rooms and trampoline parks. These are activities that take visitors a few hours to go through.</p>
<p>“It's a lot of little things that we've had in the industry for years, heightened by our new technology...to make the experience new and something people haven't seen,” Speigel said.</p>

            <title>Researchers: Oldest Evidence of Lead Pollution Found in Greece  (2025/2/10)</title>

<p>Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy - and, scientists now say, lead pollution.</p>
<p>That is the finding of a study that recently appeared in <em>Communications Earth and Environment</em>. The researchers studied <strong>sediment cores</strong> removed from mainland Greece and below the Aegean Sea. They found in the cores the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating back around 5,200 years.</p>
<p>That is 1,200 years older than the former oldest evidence of lead pollution. That evidence was discovered in Serbia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman poses for a photo in front Caryatid statues that prop up the porch of the 5th century B.C.

<p>In ancient times, lead was released into the atmosphere as a product of copper and silver production. The toxic, or poisonous, metal turned to dust over time and settled onto the soil.</p>
<p>Joseph Maran of Heidelberg University was a co-writer of the new study.</p>
<p>“Silver was used for jewelry, for special objects — but it wasn't found in a pure state,” it was mined in ore combined with lead, Maran said</p>
<p>The place with the earliest signs of lead is in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Past evidence suggests Thasos was one of the area's most important places for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.</p>
<p>Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study, said “Lead released from<strong> smelting</strong> is the world's first form of toxic or industrial pollution.”</p>
<p>The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low in ancient Greece. The levels remained low throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, and the thinkers Socrates and Plato. And the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence reach its height across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>But the new study shows that around 2,150 years ago “a very strong and<strong> abrupt</strong> increase" in lead releases caused by human activities took place across Greece, said co-writer Andreas Koutsodendris of Heidelberg University.</p>
<p>Around that time, the Roman army won control of the Greek peninsula, completely changing the area's society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping grew across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins also grew. As a result, more smelting was required, Koutsodendris said.</p>
<p>Later the Roman Empire used lead to make tools for eating and building, including pipes.</p>
<p>Past research – including a study of ice cores from Greenland – had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.</p>
<p>But the new study adds a more exact “and local picture to how lead levels changed,” said Nathan Chellman. Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, was not involved in the research.</p>

            <title>Study: Asteroid Hit Created Two ‘Grand Canyons’ on Moon  (2025/2/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>A new study suggests an <strong>asteroid </strong>strike on the moon billions of years ago left two huge valleys about the size of Earth's Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Researchers from the United States and Britain said their research shows the two steep valleys, or canyons, likely formed in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>They noted the crash, or impact, happened near the south pole on the far side of the moon. That is the side of the moon which always faces away from Earth. The area is known as the Schr<i></i>246;dinger impact basin.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by NASA shows a view from orbit looking across the surface of the moon, where an ancient asteroid strike carved out a pair of grand canyons on the moon's far side. (Ernie T. Wright/NASA via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f8084c1d-8f6f-4e18-a5b8-4ba6a4b7fad1_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by NASA shows a view from orbit looking across the surface of the moon, where an ancient asteroid strike carved out a pair of grand canyons on the moon's far side. (Ernie T. Wright/NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>The speed of the incoming object – which the team said might have been a <strong>comet</strong> – was estimated to be around 55,000 kilometers per hour. The strike likely happened about 3.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers used data collected by a spacecraft operated by the American space agency NASA. That vehicle, the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>, has been capturing lunar data since entering orbit around the moon in June 2009.</p>
<p>One main goal of the orbiter's mission was to create a highly detailed, <strong>three-dimensional</strong>, or 3D, map of the moon. The data has been used by NASA to learn more about lunar resources and to plan for future missions. The agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/lro/science-and-data/">noted</a> that the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter had “already collected as much data as all other planetary missions combined.”</p>
<p>The team studying the canyons used the orbiter's map data to <strong>simulate</strong> the path of the incoming object, as well as material that was displaced by the crash. The scientists recently published <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55675-z">a study</a> describing their results in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>The group's simulations suggested the space rock passed over the south pole before hitting. It then created a huge <strong>basin</strong> and launched rocky materials at speeds up to 1 kilometer per second.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_l2RxFLOk">researchers</a> said material was sent flying and struck the lunar surface like missiles. This resulted in the creation of the canyons.</p>
<p>The team said the canyons appear comparable in size to the Grand Canyon, in the U.S. state of Arizona.</p>
<p>The study's lead writer was David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. He told the Associated Press that findings suggest the asteroid strike was a “very violent” geologic process.</p>
<p>Kring and his team estimated the asteroid was 25 kilometers across. They estimated that the energy needed to create the two canyons would have been more than 130 times greater than the power of all the world's current nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Kring said most of the rock and debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole. That finding is good news for NASA which plans to land astronauts in that area in the future.</p>
<p>Kring noted it should improve the exploration possibilities of future astronauts.</p>
<p>"Because debris from the Schr<i></i>246;dinger impact was <strong>jettisoned</strong> away from the lunar south pole, ancient rocks in the polar region will be at or close to the surface...,” Kring told Reuters news agency. This should make it easier for future American astronauts to collect them.</p>
<p>NASA's future lunar exploration plans are known as the agency's Artemis program. The program aims to return astronauts to the moon for the first time since NASA's Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The agency's current plan is to send astronauts on a trip around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or so later by a landing attempt on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>The researchers said older rocks in the area can help scientists gain a better understanding of the moon's past history. They could also help answer questions about the formation of Earth.</p>
<p>Kring noted it is currently not clear whether the two huge canyons are permanently <strong>shadowed</strong> like some of the craters at the moon's south pole. “That is something that we're clearly going to be reexamining,” he said.</p>

            <title>American Places – Gettysburg, Pennsylvania  (2025/2/10)</title>

<p>The Gettysburg National Military Park is in the small town of Gettysburg in the eastern state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Much of the area around Gettysburg still looks like it did in the 1860s, during the American Civil War. The town is in the middle of good farmland.<br/>
<br/>
Roads pass through Gettysburg that lead to Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and other eastern cities. It is hard to believe that two huge armies fought there.</p>
<p>One fighting force was the United States Army of the Potomac, commanded by General George Meade. The other was the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee. Lee's troops had moved north into Pennsylvania from Virginia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this Friday, May 24, 2013 photo, shown is the Gettysburg National Military Park, Museum &amp; Visitor Center, in Gettysburg, Pa. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6cf93a63-c8a6-4f64-a4eb-8721a7320d3d_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - In this Friday, May 24, 2013 photo, shown is the Gettysburg National Military Park, Museum &amp; Visitor Center, in Gettysburg, Pa. </span></div>
<p>Lee believed that a Southern win of a battle on Northern land would force a negotiated settlement of the Civil War and mean independence for the Confederate States.</p>
<p>The battle of Gettysburg began on July 1, 1863. About 170,000 soldiers fought for three days. When it ended on July 3, more than 50,000 soldiers were dead, wounded or missing.</p>
<p>Lee's army lost the battle.</p>
<p>Many visitors start their visit to Gettysburg at the Gettysburg Museum of the Civil War. The <strong>museum</strong> has a large collection of Civil War objects. The museum has more than 1 million <strong>artifacts</strong>, from soldiers' private notebooks and clothing to maps of the battlefield.</p>
<p>The museum also houses the Gettysburg cyclorama painting. This kind of artwork completely surrounds the people looking at it.</p>
<p>The painting shows the artist's <strong>vision</strong> of the final major attack of the battle on July 3, 1863. Over time, it has come to be called Pickett's Charge. George Pickett was one of several Confederate commanders ordered to make the charge.</p>
<p>The Confederate soldiers reached a point close to the northern lines and headquarters. Today, the point is called the “High Water Mark.” Northern forces then turned the Confederates back.</p>
<p>The charge failed. Southern forces would never again reach so far north.<br/>
Soon after the battle, people began to visit Gettysburg to try to understand what happened there. One of those visitors, on November 19, 1863, was President Abraham Lincoln. He was invited to help <strong>dedicate</strong> a burial ground for Union soldiers killed in the battle.</p>
<p>Lincoln spoke for just two minutes. But his speech, known as “The Gettysburg Address,” is one of the most famous pieces of American <strong>oratory</strong>.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>In American English, we use many expressions to describe when two people have a lot of similarities or are very close. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>If we say two people are <u>joined at the hip,</u> they are nearly always together. If we describe individuals as <u>thick as thieves</u>, it means they are very close. People considered <u>two peas in a pod</u> have many things in common. And we use the term <u>kindred spirits</u> to describe people who often share the same opinions and interests.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Tara Davis-Woodhall and husband Hunter Woodhall kiss after she won the silver medal for the U.S. in the women's long jump final at the World Athletics Championships in Hungary, Aug. 20, 2023.

<p>These expressions can represent people who grew closer for different reasons. Maybe they <strong>complemented</strong> each other well in certain ways. Or maybe their situations brought them together for the purpose of completing something important or meaningful.</p>
<p>But today we are going to discuss a very special kind of relationship – one that involves two people who are <strong>romantically</strong> involved and very successful.</p>
<p>People in such relationships can be described as <u>power couples</u>.</p>
<p>There are many examples of famous power couples, including successful movie stars, musicians and others in the performing arts. But power couples can exist in many other industries and communities, as well. And, the two people do not have to work in the same industry.</p>
<p>If they do, however, that can make them even more powerful. For example, a well-known <strong>architect</strong> who builds homes could be partnered with a famous designer who <strong>decorates</strong> them. Or, one person in a power couple may be a music producer, while the other is a famous singer.</p>
<p>Even though power couples involve highly successful people, one person could describe their partner as <u>their better half</u>. This is a way to <strong>compliment </strong>their “other half” in the relationship. For example, one might say during a meeting with a friend, “Hello! How are you? And more importantly, how is your better half?”</p>
<p>Now, let's hear two friends use some of these expressions.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, I'm not used to seeing you alone. Where's your <strong>sidekick</strong>?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Huh? Who are you talking about?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Ben. You guys have been joined at the hip for weeks. Looks like you're thick as thieves. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, the project is pretty important for the company. So, we're putting in a lot of hours. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Are you becoming kindred spirits from working so much together?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No. It's just keeping us both very busy. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Busy trying to become the new power couple in the office?</em></p>
<p><em>B: What are you talking about?? We're not thick as thieves or kindred spirits, and we're definitely not a power couple. We are just working hard on the same project! </em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Norway Nears Goal to Sell only Electric New Cars  (2025/2/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202502/norway-nears-goal-to-sell-only-electric-new-cars.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">08 February, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Norway is very close to meeting its goal of selling only fully electric new vehicles starting this year.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Road Federation (OFV), an automotive industry group, estimates that nearly 96 percent of new cars registered in Norway in January were all-electric. No other country has such a high rate of electric car (EV) ownership.</p>
<p>The OFV noted that of the 9,343 new cars sold last month in Norway, 8,954 of them were all-electric. Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric. The first of those came in 33rd place among the 50 models, the federation said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE: Electric cars are charged via a charging station on a street in the Norwegian capital Oslo on September 25, 2024. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8a75879d-727f-4cd8-ab54-b6b3e446d6da_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE: Electric cars are charged via a charging station on a street in the Norwegian capital Oslo on September 25, 2024. </span></div>
<p>The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) reported the share of electric cars in Europe was just 13.6 percent during 2024. That was the first recorded decrease since 2020.</p>
<p>OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement, "We've never seen this before...If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal." He noted that reaching 100 percent of the goal means to continue to offer the “<strong>incentives</strong> that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.”</p>
<p>Even though it is a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims to only sell "zero <strong>emission</strong>" new vehicles starting in 2025. That goal is 10 years ahead of the target set by the European Union (EU). Norway is not a member of the EU.</p>
<p>One difference between the EU and Norway's method is that Norway has not banned the sale of cars with engines that burn fuel. Instead, Norway offers a number of tax breaks to EV manufacturers and owners. On the other hand, the country heavily taxes gas-powered vehicles.</p>
<p>For example, Norwegian EV owners do not have to pay road<strong> tolls</strong> and receive free parking in public car parks. EVs are also permitted to use parts of roads normally saved for public transportation vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Chargers everywhere</strong></p>
<p>While some tax breaks and incentives have been reduced over the years, EVs have still kept expanding across Norwegian roads.</p>
<p>Frode Hvattum is a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs. He told the French News Agency AFP he started buying EVs because of his concern for the environment and for the <strong>benefits</strong> of driving them.</p>
<p>He lives in an area near Oslo where the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Some less costly Chinese EVs are increasingly appearing too.</p>
<p>Many homes have a device to charge, or supply electricity to, their EV's <strong>battery</strong>. Norway also has a large national network of superfast charging stations.</p>
<p>Having a nationwide charging network was important for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, often travels by car to his second home in the mountains several hours outside Oslo. He said he finds it easy to plan and make trips with numerous charging stations available.</p>
<p>"You don't have to plan your trip as much as before," Hvattum said. He added that he uses the 15-to-20-minute charging breaks his vehicle needs to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting its goal</strong></p>
<p>Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100 percent mark this year, experts say Norway can still be seen as having met its goal.</p>
<p>Christina Bu heads the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association. She told AFP, "We should finish the year at between 95 and 100 percent."</p>

<p>This Sunday, February 9, is not a holiday in the United States, but it might seem like one to Americans.</p>
<p>Many will be attending parties to watch Super Bowl LIX. The Super Bowl is the championship game of professional American football.</p>
<p>The National Football League, or NFL, has 32 teams mainly based in large cities across the U.S.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Kansas City Chiefs place kicker Harrison Butker (7) kicks the game-winning field goal in the second half of the NFL Super Bowl 57 football game, against the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, Feb. 12, 2023, in Glendale, Ariz.

<p>The first professional <strong>league</strong> was formed in 1920, when representatives of four teams met in Canton, Ohio. The group first called itself the American Professional Football Association but changed the name two years later to the National Football League.</p>
<p>In 1960, Texas businessman Lamar Hunt pushed the effort to create the American Football League, or AFL. The two leagues competed with each other to sign top football players from universities around the country.</p>
<p>In 1965, established NFL players began negotiating to play for the competing league. So, officials of the two leagues decided to work together. This agreement established a championship game between the two leagues. It was officially called the AFL-NFL World Championship Game but became known as the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The first Super Bowl was played in 1967 in Los Angeles, California. The Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs. It was not a very <strong>exciting</strong> game. Many of the seats in the sports center were empty. That changed with the Super Bowl played two years later. Experts say the public finally accepted the new league when the New York Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts.</p>
<p>After that game in 1969, officials of the two leagues decided to create a new National Football League. They divided the teams into two competing conferences, the American Conference, or AFC, and the National Conference, NFC. Each year, the conference champions play in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Today, the Super Bowl is a major sporting event. Tens of thousands of people will be watching the game Sunday at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of other people around the world will be watching Super Bowl LIX. They will be watching to see if the AFC Kansas City Chiefs or the NFC Philadelphia Eagles become the champions of American football.</p>
<p>Both teams have had success in the Big Game. The Eagles are one-time NFL champions. They defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII. This Sunday will be the team's fifth NFL championship game appearance.</p>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs have played for the championship six times. They have won four times, including the last two Super Bowls. The Chiefs are the first team in NFL history to have a chance to win a third Super Bowl <strong>in a row</strong>.</p>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em> we answer a question from Ramatoulaye in Senegal. Here is Ramatoulaye's question:</p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p>
<p>Thank you and all the VOA Learning English team for their great work! My question is: what is the difference between “regarding” and “regardless?”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Regarding and Regardless" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2593bf3f-7416-4990-8c7b-cdbb32887111_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Regarding and Regardless</span></div>
<p>Thank you for your comments, Ramatoulaye. And I am happy to answer your question.</p>
<p>Both words are very useful in speaking and writing. That's because the words give us a quick way to connect to other ideas.</p>
<p>“Regarding” simply means what someone is talking or writing about. Consider the following two examples:</p>
<p><em>We have all the information we need about the project.</em></p>
<p><em>We have all the information we need regarding the project.</em></p>
<p>The word “regarding” in the second example means the same thing as the preposition “about” in the first example. We generally use the word “about” more than “regarding.” However, it is more common to use “regarding” in formal speech than in informal communication.</p>
<p>Also, the expression “in regard to” means the same thing as “regarding.” Here are some examples:</p>
<p><em><u>In regard to</u></em><em> the price, I think it was too expensive.</em></p>
<p><em><u>In regard to</u></em><em> what you said, I don't think we know all the facts yet.</em></p>
<p>Note that we use a noun, noun phrase, or noun clause after the expression “in regard to.” Also, you will sometimes hear native speakers say “in regards to” instead of “in regard to.”</p>
<p>Here is something you may find interesting when we compare the expression “in regard to” and the verb “regard.” The verb “regard” is a somewhat formal way to say, “look at.” So, just as we can direct someone's attention to something by having them look at it, the expression “in regard to” directs us to something we are talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless</strong></p>
<p>The word “regardless” expresses the idea that one or more things do not affect the current situation or what we want to express now. When you look at the word, you will see that it ends with the suffix <em>-less</em>. This suffix means the same thing as the word “without.” So, “regardless” means “without regard to.”</p>
<p>Consider the following examples.</p>
<p><em><u>Regardless of</u> religion, all people want happiness.</em></p>
<p><em>All people want happiness, <u>regardless of</u> religion.</em></p>
<p>Notice that you can use the word “regardless” either before or after the sentence or phrase it <strong>modifies</strong>.</p>
<p>For our readers and listeners, what are your questions about American English? Regardless of your level of English, we want to hear from you! Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="21voa.com">21voa.com</a>. And please let us know where you are from, too.</p>

<p>A new study warns that millions of Europeans could die from heat-related causes by the end of the century.</p>
<p>The study was based on computer <strong>simulations</strong> of predicted climate activity in 854 different European cities. It found that extreme temperatures, mostly heat, could kill as many as 2.3 million people in Europe by 2100.</p>
<p>The researchers said the number of predicted deaths could be reduced if nations are able to find better ways of cutting carbon pollution levels and dealing with extreme heat.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, people watch a sunset sitting on a beach next to the Trafalgar Lighthouse in Los Ca&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;241;os de Meca, Spain, on, July 29, 2020.

<p>Currently, cold weather kills far more people in Europe than hot weather. But the study found that as temperatures continue to rise, deaths from cold weather will lessen over time. However, heat-related deaths are predicted to rise sharply.</p>
<p>Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine led the research. The results appeared recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00239-4#:~:text=An%20extra%202.3%20million%20people,the%20effects%20of%20rising%20temperatures.">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>The researchers urged increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and expand indoor air-cooling systems and cooling centers in parts of Europe. Without such efforts, places in Italy, southern Spain and Greece are likely to see large increases in heat deaths related to climate change, the study found.</p>
<p>On the other hand, much of Scandinavia and Britain are predicted to see fewer temperature-related deaths, largely because low temperatures are expected to become more moderate.</p>
<p>Pierre Masselot studies the environmental effects of human health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He helped lead the research.</p>
<p>Masselot told the Associated Press that drops in cold deaths in northern parts of Europe are happening in areas not as populated as places further south. “The Mediterranean is a so-called climate hotspot," he said. "It's a <strong>region</strong> that is warming much quicker than the rest of the world. And Malta is right in the middle of it.”</p>
<p>The study predicts Malta's temperature-related deaths will increase by 269 people for every 100,000 individuals by the end of the century. On the other hand, Ireland's rate is expected to drop slightly to 15 per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>European officials reported several heat waves have killed thousands of people in recent years across the continent. The highest number was in 2003, when about 70,000 deaths were recorded.</p>
<p>Among the areas predicted to see the most deaths from future temperature rises is Barcelona, Spain. The study found almost 250,000 people could die from temperature-related causes in that city by 2100. And the study warned that Rome and Naples could have up to 150,000 deaths.</p>
<p>The study predicted that more than 5.8 million extra heat deaths would be linked to climate change. At the same time, the study found cold-related deaths would drop by 3.5 million.</p>

            <title>Study Finds India’s Tiger Population Doubled in 12 Years  (2025/2/6)</title>

<p class="MsoBodyText">A recent study says India has doubled its tiger population in 12 years.</p>
<p>Researchers said the gain came from efforts to protect the big cats from hunters, and to protect against the loss of tiger <strong>habitat</strong> and <strong>prey</strong>, among other things.</p>
<p>The National Tiger Conservation Authority said the number of tigers grew from an estimated 1,706 in 2010 to around 3,682 in 2022. Those numbers mean India is home to about 75 percent of the total tiger population.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Tigers interact at the Ranthambore National Park in Sawai Madhopur, India on April 12, 2015.

<p>The research shows that a reduction in conflict between humans and wildlife also played a part in the population growth. The study credited efforts to improve economic conditions for communities near tiger habitats. The researchers said the growth in the tiger population also led to improvements in local economies through increased <strong>ecotourism</strong>.</p>
<p>The study appears in the publication <em>Science</em>. It said India's success demonstrates that wildlife protection can help both <strong>biodiversity</strong> and nearby communities.</p>
<p>“The common belief is that human densities <strong>preclude</strong> an increase in tiger populations," said Yadvendradev Jhala. Jhala is a scientist at Bengaluru-based Indian National Academy of Sciences and was the study's lead writer. “What the research shows is that it's not the human density, but the <strong>attitude</strong> of people, which matters more.”</p>
<p>Wildlife <strong>conservationists</strong> and ecologists welcomed the study. But they said making the source data available to a larger group of scientists would aid tigers and other wildlife in India. The study was based on data collected by Indian government-supported organizations.</p>
<p>Arjun Gopalaswamy is an ecologist who knows how to measure wildlife populations. He said that estimates from India's official tiger observation program have been undependable. He said some of the numbers in the study are much higher than past estimates of tiger populations from the same datasets. But he added that the study's findings seem to have corrected a data problem noted repeatedly by scientists since 2011 related to tiger population size and their <strong>range</strong>.</p>
<p>The study said tigers disappeared in some areas. These included habitats that were not near national parks or other protected areas, and areas of increased development, increased human use of forest resources and areas with armed conflict.</p>
<p>“Without community support and<strong> participation</strong> and community benefits, conservation is not possible in our country,” said Jhala.</p>
<p>That means local people need to see good results from their efforts to save tigers.</p>
<p>Tigers are spread across about 138,200 square kilometers of India. But just 25 percent of the area is rich in tiger prey and is protected. Another 45 percent of tiger habitat is shared with about 60 million people, the study said.</p>
<p>Jhala said strong wildlife protection legislation is the “backbone” of tiger conservation in India. “Habitat is not a <strong>constraint</strong>, it's the quality of the habitat which is a constraint,” he said.</p>
<p>Wildlife biologist Ravi Chellam, who did not take part in the study, praised the tiger conservation efforts as promising. But, he said, such efforts need to be extended to other wild animals to better care for the whole ecosystem in India.</p>
<p>Chellam said several kinds of Indian wildlife are “on the edge,” and need more attention.</p>

            <title>New US Jet Breaks Sound Barrier in First Flight Test  (2025/2/6)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202502/new-us-jet-breaks-sound-barrier-in-first-flight-test.mp3"/>

<p>An experimental aircraft developed by a private American company broke the sound barrier during a recent flight test.</p>
<p>California-based company Boom Supersonic built the plane, named XB-1. The company said the aircraft reached a speed of Mach 1.05 during a test on January 28. The test flight operated from the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port in Mojave, California.</p>
<p>Any speed greater than Mach 1.0 breaks the sound barrier and is considered supersonic. The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/for-kids-and-students/what-is-supersonic-flight-grades-5-8/#:~:text=Vehicles%20that%20fly%20at%20supersonic,to%20the%20speed%20of%20sound.">explains</a> that at sea level, the speed of sound is estimated to be about 1,236 kilometers per hour.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Boom Supersonic's XB-1 aircraft breaks the sound barrier, Mach 1, during a test flight Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025, over the Mohave Desert, Calif.

(Boom Supersonic via AP)</span></div>
<p>In a statement, Boom Supersonic said the XB-1 demonstrator aircraft climbed to more than 35,000 feet before reaching Mach 1.0. It recorded the speed within 11 minutes of taking off. The company also released a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qisIViAHwI">video feed</a> of the supersonic test flight.</p>
<p>The company said in a press release, “Historically, supersonic aircraft have been the work of nation states, developed by militaries and governments.” But the latest flight made the XB-1 “the world's first independently developed supersonic <strong>jet</strong>” to break the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic said.</p>
<p>The company's founder and chief executive officer, Blake Scholl, said, “XB-1's supersonic flight demonstrates that the technology for passenger supersonic flight has arrived.”</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://boomsupersonic.com/">Boom Supersonic</a> launched in 2014 “with the goal of making high-speed travel <strong>mainstream</strong> and <strong>enabling</strong> a new world of human connection.” With that in mind, the company has been working to develop a supersonic passenger airliner called Overture. The aircraft would carry up to 80 passengers.</p>
<p>Boom Supersonic is one of several American companies seeking to develop supersonic flight vehicles. NASA is also working on a supersonic aircraft in partnership with a U.S. contractor.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The last time supersonic travel was available to passengers was 2003. That is the year the Concorde – the world's first supersonic passenger jet aircraft – stopped service. Britain and France jointly operated the Concorde.</p>
<p>But the joint operation between British Airways and Air France suffered several business difficulties that led to the decision to stop flying the supersonic planes. Some of the difficulties were linked to publicity about a deadly Concorde crash in 2000. That incident involved an Air France airliner crashing shortly after taking off from Paris. The crash claimed a total of 113 lives.</p>
<p>Boom Supersonic says its planned Overture airliner will be designed to transport passengers from the U.S. East Coast across the Atlantic to Europe in about 3-and-a-half hours. The flight with normal passenger jets takes about eight hours.</p>
<p>Amy Marino Spowart is the president and chief executive officer at the National Aeronautic Association. She told The Associated Press the latest supersonic test flight suggests “the future of <strong>aviation</strong> is here and now.” Spowart added, “Not only is there hope for faster and better commercial flight, but Boom proves that it can be done <strong>sustainably</strong>.”</p>
<p>Boom Supersonic has said its planned supersonic airliner will be designed to run on up to 100 percent sustainable aircraft fuel. Such sustainable fuels are made from non-petroleum products, such as food waste or other biomass materials. Both XB-1 and Overture are made mostly from a carbon-based <strong>composite</strong> material to provide “a strong, lightweight structure,” the company said.</p>
<p>NASA's supersonic aircraft – built together with Lockheed Martin – is called X-59. It is also an experimental plane that is seeking to test the level of noise produced by supersonic travel. Currently, supersonic flights are banned over land because of the loud noise they produce.</p>

<p>NASA has <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/quesst/quesst-mission/quesst-the-mission-description/">explained</a> it plans to carry out testing this year of the X-59 aircraft, which has been designed and engineered to operate at lower noise levels than other supersonic aircraft. The tests – to take place at supersonic test centers in California – are designed “to prove the quiet supersonic technology works as designed.”</p>
<p>NASA said that after that testing is done, the agency plans to begin community reaction studies, beginning in 2026. These will involve flying the X-59 over several cities and then asking people on the ground to share their thoughts on the level of noise they heard.</p>
<p>NASA has said the X-59 – which measures 30 meters long and nine meters wide – is expected to fly at 1.4 times the speed of sound. That is about 1,500 kilometers per hour.</p>

<p>Japan's space agency says it successfully launched a <strong>navigation</strong> satellite on its new H3 rocket. The latest launch on February 2 took place as the country aims to develop a more <strong>precise</strong> positioning system.</p>
<p>The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island.</p>
<p>Makoto Arita oversees the H3 project for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency known as JAXA. Arita said everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after liftoff.</p><div class="contentImage"><img a="" alt="The H3 Launch Vehicle No. 5, carrying the " at="" center="" feb.="" in="" japan="" launch="" lifts="" michibiki="" no.="" off="" pad="" southern="" space="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8068b7d6-2728-49af-a20b-c23c10b60066_w268_r1.jpg" sunday="" tanegashima=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">The H3 Launch Vehicle No. 5, carrying the "Michibiki No. 6," lifts off at a launch pad in Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, southern Japan, Sunday Feb. 2, 2025.</span></div>
<p>Officials said it should reach its target orbit around Earth in the middle of February.</p>
<p>Japan's current system is called the <strong>quasi</strong>-<strong>zenith</strong> satellite system, or QZSS. It started operating in 2018 and has four satellites that serve a regional <strong>navigation</strong> system. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth satellite in the network.</p>
<p>Michibiki's signals are used to <strong>supplement</strong> the American satellite system called the Global Positioning System (GPS). It will also improve positioning data for smartphones, car navigation, navigation at sea and <strong>drones</strong>.</p>
<p>Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026. The Japan Science and Technology Agency hopes that will create a more precise global positioning ability without depending on foreign services, including GPS. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.</p>
<p><strong>First launch not successful</strong></p>
<p>Sunday's launch was the fourth successful flight in a row for the H3 system. The first attempt to launch last year failed and the rocket had to be destroyed with its <strong>payload</strong>.</p>
<p>Japan considers the ability to regularly put satellites into orbit as important to its space program and national security. It has been developing two new leading rockets. One is the large H3 from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The other is a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of IHI corporation. Japan hopes to meet the needs of companies for space launch services and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.</p>

            <title>Huge Iceberg Could Threaten Penguins in the South Atlantic Ocean  (2025/2/5)</title>

<p>Scientists are worried that a large <strong>iceberg</strong> heading toward an island in the South Atlantic Ocean could threaten wildlife there.</p>
<p>Researchers say the iceberg is the largest in the world. It is moving through the South Atlantic toward the island of South Georgia. The island is a British overseas territory that is about 1,400 kilometers east of the Falkland Islands.</p>
<p>Scientists say South Georgia is a main mating ground for wildlife, especially penguins and seals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This image provided by the Ministry of Defence shows the iceberg, known as A23a, on Nov. 25, 2024, off the coast of Antarctica. (Cpl Tom Cann RAF/Crown Copyright 2024 via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/52c90d07-ee3c-49bc-abf0-3215f1af247c_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This image provided by the Ministry of Defence shows the iceberg, known as A23a, on Nov. 25, 2024, off the coast of Antarctica. (Cpl Tom Cann RAF/Crown Copyright 2024 via AP)</span></div>
<p>The iceberg is officially known as A23a and it measures about 3,500 square kilometers. It has existed since 1986, when it broke off from the Antarctic <strong>shelf</strong>.</p>
<p>Andrew Meijers is an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey. He told the French News Agency (AFP) that scientists have been using satellite imagery to follow the iceberg's movements.</p>
<p>Meijers said observations had shown the iceberg had not broken into smaller pieces like some other so-called "megabergs" that passed through the Southern Ocean. He added that predicting the iceberg's exact path is difficult. But ocean conditions suggest it should reach South Georgia in two to four weeks.</p>
<p>Meijers said he is worried the iceberg will get caught on the underground <strong>continental shelf</strong> around South Georgia. But he said it is also possible the large ice mass could miss the shelf and continue moving into open waters beyond South Georgia.</p>
<p>If the iceberg does get caught, or stuck, on the shelf, Meijers said it could remain there for months or it could break into pieces. Meijers is concerned that this could harm efforts by penguins and seals on the island to feed and raise their young. Icebergs that have grounded there in the past led to the deaths of young penguins and seals, he said.</p>
<p>Raul Cordero is a mechanical engineer from Chile's University of Santiago. He is also a member of the National Antarctic Research Committee. Cordero told AFP he thinks the iceberg will miss South Georgia.</p>
<p>"The island acts as an <strong>obstacle</strong> for ocean currents and therefore usually <strong>diverts</strong> the water long before it reaches the island," he said. "The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high." Cordero added, however, that some iceberg pieces could affect the island.</p>
<p>Soledad Tiranti is a <strong>glacier</strong> expert who is currently on an Argentinian exploration trip in the Antarctic. She told AFP that icebergs such as A23a "are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck" on the seabed.</p>
<p>It is currently summer in South Georgia and penguins and seals from the area have been looking for food in the cold Antarctic waters to bring back to their young. Meijers said the animals might have to go around the iceberg if it gets stuck.</p>
<p>He added that if they had to move around it, this would take a lot of their energy, possibly leading to animal deaths. The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a "bad season" with cases of bird flu, Meijers said.</p>
<p>Iceberg A23a remained stuck for 30 years before finally breaking free from the Antarctic shelf in 2020. Scientists watching its movements say the iceberg has followed nearly the same path as other large ice masses in the past.</p>
<p>The icebergs generally pass the east side of the Antarctic Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a path known as "iceberg <strong>alley</strong>." They are pushed by the world's most powerful ocean current system, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</p>

Email is one of the most important ways through which we communicate. It has become part of most everyone's day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Writing a good email can mean the difference between someone reading it and writing back, and someone ignoring it all together. Do you have questions on how to make your message more effective?</p>
<p>Today on <em>Education Tips, </em>we will answer the question, “How can I make my emails better?”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Education Tips: How to Write a Good Email" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/5663032C-AEBD-4C48-BFC2-1BFC5947DC1C_w268_r1.png"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Education Tips: How to Write a Good Email</span></div>
<p>Emails are made up of four different parts:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>the subject line,</li>
<li>the opening,</li>
<li>the body, and</li>
<li>the closing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us explore how to make each of these parts better.</p>
<p><strong>Subject line</strong></p>
<p>The subject line is what the other person, or receiver, will read first. The subject line is usually the most important part of an email. It should be short but contain enough details that the receiver recognizes the subject of the email. A good subject line sets the expectations for the email. A bad subject line can mean the receiver will not read the email.</p>
<p>Some people will add the word “important” to the subject line, but this does not provide enough information. Instead of writing “important,” two better choices for subject lines are:</p>
<p><em>Meeting Tomorrow at 10am to Discuss New Changes<br/>
Question About Future Classes</em></p>
<p><strong>Opening an email</strong></p>
<p>As in any form of writing, you should know your <strong>audience</strong>. The opening of an email depends on things like how <strong>formal </strong>the relationship is.</p>
<p>If you are sending an email to a friend or someone you work with, two good openings or greetings are:</p>
<p><em>Good Morning/Afternoon,<br/>
Hello, or Hello [name], </em></p>
<p>If you are sending the email to someone you do not know and it is a formal situation, some possible openings are:</p>
<p><em>Dear [name of department],<br/>
To Whom it May Concern,</em></p>
<p>In a formal situation, when you know the name of the person, a good opening is simply:</p>
<p><em>Dear [title] [family name],</em><br/>
As in, <em>Dear Mister Brown, </em></p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>The body of the email is where you ask for what you need or make clear your reason for writing the email. This could be asking them a question or keeping them informed. The body of the email should <strong>prioritize</strong> the most important information. It should be direct, and it is wise to keep it short.</p>
<p>If the person you are emailing does not know you, you should <strong>introduce</strong> yourself in the first few lines. You might write:</p>
<p><em>My name is Patricia Jones. I am sending this email to get some more information about the job you advertised.</em></p>
<p>After you have introduced yourself and given your reason for writing, you can follow this with the body of your email. The most important information should come first. This makes your email clear to your receiver and saves them time. Here is an example.</p>
<p><em>I wanted to know if you are currently accepting <strong>applications</strong>. If so, where can I send my information? Additionally, will you be meeting people in-person or online?</em></p>
<p>It is important to clearly explain yourself in as few words as possible. Try to keep your email short, but <strong>polite</strong>. This is important because you want to make yourself clear to your receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Closings</strong></p>
<p>The last part to a good email is the closing. It is usually one or two words that let the receiver know that this is the end of the email. The ending should include your name and tell the receiver where you work and what you do. A few different closings are:</p>
<p><em>Kind regards,<br/>
Best,<br/>
Thank you,</em></p>
<p>Some applications create an <strong>automatic signature</strong> for the sender. This is useful because it saves time when you are writing.</p>
<p><strong>Example email</strong></p>
<p>So, what does a completed email look like? Here is an example email:</p>
<p>If you follow these suggestions, you will find that you receive more <strong>responses</strong> to your emails. Effective email writing is important especially now when so much of what we do is online.</p>

            <title>New Zealand Recognizes a Mountain as a Legal Person  (2025/2/5)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202502/new-zealand-recognizes-a-mountain-as-a-legal-person.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/><span class="datetime">04 February, 2025</span><br/>
<p>New Zealand's parliament recently passed a law that gives a mountain all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.</p>
<p>The <strong>indigenous</strong> Māori people of New Zealand consider the mountain their ancestor.</p>
<p>The mountain is now known by its Māori name, Taranaki Maunga. The Māori people of New Zealand represent about 15 percent of the country's population.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A man takes a picture of his wife with Mount Taranaki, also known as Mount Egmont, in the background in New Plymouth, New Zealand, Sept. 26, 2011. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7374aa6d-0b65-47f6-a124-0eaba2737c33_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A man takes a picture of his wife with Mount Taranaki, also known as Mount Egmont, in the background in New Plymouth, New Zealand, Sept. 26, 2011. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara, File)</span></div>
<p>Taranaki Maunga is a <strong>dormant</strong> volcano on New Zealand's North Island. Snow covers the top of the 2,516-meter-high mountain. It is a popular place for <strong>tourism</strong>, hiking and snow sports.</p>
<p>The legal recognition of the mountain is one of the steps New Zealand's government has taken to make up for harm the indigenous population suffered in the past. The new law makes it known that the Taranaki area was stolen from the Māori after New Zealand was colonized.</p>
<p>The new law gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and <strong>liabilities</strong> of a person. The law says a newly created group will be “the face and voice” of the mountain. Four members from local Māori tribes and four members appointed by the country's conservation minister will be in the group.</p>
<p>Paul Goldsmith is the lawmaker responsible for the legal settlements between the government and Māori tribes. In a speech to Parliament, he said, “The mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual <strong>sustenance</strong> and a final resting place."</p>
<p>Britain colonized New Zealand in the 1700s and 1800s. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook named the volcano Mount Egmont.</p>
<p>In 1840, Māori tribes and representatives of the British government signed the Treaty of Waitangi. The treaty promised the Māori would keep the rights to their land and resources. However, the British government began breaking parts of the treaty after that.</p>
<p>In 1865, the government took a large area of Taranaki land, including the mountain, to punish the Māori for rebelling against British rule. Over the next one hundred years, hunting and sports groups helped oversee how the land was used, but the Māori did not.</p>
<p>Goldsmith told the Associated Press that, in the past, Māori customs connected to the mountain were banned while the government supported tourism in the area.</p>
<p>The Māori protest movement of the 1970s and 1980s led to increased recognition of the Māori language, culture and rights in New Zealand's law. This has included billions of dollars to pay for the harm caused by breaking the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>
<p>The mountain's legal rights are in place to support its health and wellbeing. The law will support traditional uses of the land and calls for conservation work to protect the native wildlife. The mountain will remain open to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Are other landforms considered people?</strong></p>
<p>New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize landforms as people. In 2014, a law gave personhood to Te Urewera, a large forest on the North Island. Government ownership ended and the Tūhoe tribe became its guardian.</p>
<p>And in 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as a human, as part of a settlement with the tribe connected to the river.</p>
<p>All 123 lawmakers in Parliament supported the new law for Taranaki Maunga. The unity of the vote was a change from recent disagreements in New Zealand about proposed changes to the Treaty of Waitangi itself.</p>
<p>In November, about 40,000 people marched to Parliament to protest a new law with proposed changes to the treaty. The protesters said the new law would take away Māori rights and harm the progress that has been made during the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Most officials do not expect the bill with the proposed changes to become law.</p>

            <title>Scientists Find ‘Chorus Waves’ in Unexpected Part of Space  (2025/2/4)</title>

<p class="paragraph">International researchers recently released a study on bursts of energy in an unexpected area of space.</p>
<p>Scientists call the energetic activity “<strong>chorus</strong> waves” because they are said to move at the same <strong>frequency</strong> as sounds humans can hear. When the energy is turned into audio signals, the waves sound like birds <strong>chirping</strong>.</p>
<p>Researchers have known about chorus waves in space for many years. But the latest research has found the waves exist 100,000 kilometers from Earth. Chorus waves have never before been measured at such a big distance from a planet.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="NASA's four Magnetospheric Multiscale, or MMS, satellites at the Astrotech Space Operations facility in Titusville, Florida, March 2015.

(NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>In an email, study writer Chengming Liu from Beihang University in Beijing wrote: “They are one of the strongest and most <strong>significant </strong>waves in space.”</p>
<p>Allison Jaynes is a space physicist at the University of Iowa who was not involved with the study. Speaking about the recent study, Jaynes said, “That opens up a lot of new questions about the physics that could be possible in this area.”</p>
<p>The newfound chorus waves were detected in an area where Earth's <strong>magnetic field</strong> is stretched out. Scientists said they did not expect to find <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_jRlu8izx">the waves</a> there. The discovery raises new questions about how the chirping waves form.</p>
<p>Jaynes added, “We definitely need to find more of these events.”</p>
<p>Scientists still are not sure how the waves develop. But they think Earth's <strong>magnetic field</strong> may have something to do with it.</p>
<p>For many years, radio <strong>antennas</strong> have picked up chorus waves. This includes receivers at an Antarctica research station in the 1960s. And NASA's two Van Allen Probes heard the chirping sounds from Earth's <strong>radiation belts</strong> at a closer distance than the newest observations.</p>
<p>The latest chorus waves were picked up by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites. They were launched in 2015 to explore the Earth and the sun's magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Chorus waves have also been found near other planets including Jupiter and Saturn. The waves can produce high-energy electrons.<strong> </strong>That means they can threaten satellite communications.</p>
<p>The researchers said their findings suggest that chorus waves might be found everywhere in the magnetic fields of planets.</p>
<p>The study was released on January 22 in the scientific publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>

            <title>US Approves Treatment for Severe High Blood Pressure  (2025/2/4)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Michael Garrity had dangerously high blood pressure for many years. And the medicines that doctors gave him could not control it.</p>
<p>But a new treatment targeting some nerves on his kidneys has helped the 62-year-old Garrity have normal blood pressure for the first time in years.</p>
<p>When some nerves from the kidneys send more signals than is normal, dangerously high blood pressure can result. The new treatment uses ultrasound, or high frequency sound waves, to reduce the signals the nerves send.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by Massachusetts General Hospital, patient Mike Garrity, center, speaks with Drs. Joe Garasic, left, and Randy Zusman in Boston, on Sept. 25, 2024.

<p>“My blood pressure would <strong>spike</strong> and I'd run out of breath and feel tired, and that doesn't happen anymore,” said Garrity, who lives in the American state of Massachusetts. Garrity still takes medicine but at lower amounts. He said he is very happy with the results of his treatment.</p>
<p>About half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure. It increases the risk for heart attacks, <strong>strokes</strong>, kidney failure, and possibly <strong>dementia</strong>. Many people do not know they have high blood pressure until something goes wrong.</p>
<p>“Know your blood pressure, know the numbers,” said Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital. He treats difficult cases. He also said people who think they are healthy should still have their blood pressure measured once a year or more.</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of people with high blood pressure control the condition well. That might mean there is a need for new treatments. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the new ultrasound treatment about a year ago.</p>
<p>Some hospitals are offering the treatment, but only for patients who might be likely to have good results.</p>
<p><strong>What is high blood pressure?</strong></p>
<p>Blood pressure is measured using two values. One value is called “systolic” pressure. It is the force blood puts on the walls of <strong>arteries</strong> as it is pumped out of the heart. The second value is called “diastolic” pressure. That number measures pressure in <strong>blood vessels</strong> between heartbeats.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that normal blood pressure is less than 120 over 80. However, blood pressure naturally changes throughout the day. It is higher when a person is physically active or experiences tension. But when it stays higher than, for example, 130 over 80 or higher, it might mean the heart is working too hard.</p>
<p><strong>Treatments for high blood pressure</strong></p>
<p>Instead of drugs, doctors advise lifestyle changes as the first step to reduce blood pressure. Changes can include losing weight, getting regular exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to deal with tension, or stress, in a healthy way.</p>
<p>However, if blood pressure reaches 140 over 90, taking medicine becomes necessary. Zusman said most patients need two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living.</p>
<p>The high blood pressure Garrity has struggled with resists treatment with drugs. He tried taking four to six drugs as well as eating healthy food and exercising. Still, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or higher.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Garasic is a heart specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. He performed Garrity's operation. He said doctors pass a small tube through blood vessels to reach the kidneys. Then they direct ultrasound through kidney arteries targeting the nerves. The operation takes about one hour.</p>
<p>The treatment is not a cure, and it does not help all patients. But Garasic said several studies show on average an eight to 10-point drop in blood pressure. This small decrease can still help some patients. Others, like Garrity, see bigger drops. This can help reduce the number of medications patients must take.</p>
<p>Studies connected to the new ultrasound treatment have only lasted a few years. That means doctors do not yet know if the nerves will grow back. The American Heart Association says people with high blood pressure and their doctors should have “thoughtful and informed discussions” to decide who might be the right patients to try the treatment.</p>

<p>A New York food bank was offered a large donation of fresh fish last month — but the gift came with a <strong>complication.</strong></p>
<p>LocalCoho, a New York salmon farm that was closing, wanted to give 18,100 kilograms of coho salmon to the Food Bank of Central New York. The high-quality protein could feed thousands of families.</p>
<p>However, the gift fish were still alive and swimming in the farm's large tanks. The organization needed to find a way to remove about 13,000 salmon from the tanks and, later, process them into food.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Stephen Zicari, an employee of Local Coho salmon fish farm in Auburn, N.Y., nets fish from one of the farm's tanks Friday, Jan. 24, 2025, that will be donated to the Food Bank of Central New York.

<p>And the food aid group needed to do all this quickly, before the business closed permanently at the end of January.</p>
<p>Thanks to many volunteers, the group was able to empty the tanks in time, place the fish in cold storage and transport them to a processer.</p>
<p>Brian McManus is the food bank's chief operations officer. He said that the short amount of time to complete the operation made activities difficult. But, he said, “I knew that we had the will. I knew we had the expertise.”</p>
<p>Food waste has been a big problem around the world for years. More than one-third of the food produced in the United States is never eaten and much of it ends up in <strong>landfills</strong>.</p>
<p>Christina Hudson Kohler was among the volunteers who got into the water to collect the fish and put them into the cold storage containers.</p>
<p>“It's a little bit different,” Kohler said during a break. “In the past, my volunteer work with the food bank has been sorting carrots or peppers....”</p>
<p>LocalCoho was a new company that had been developing a <strong>sustainable</strong> salmon farming system. The system employed <strong>recirculated</strong> water. The company had been supplying coho salmon to buyers, including restaurants, with the goal of building farms across the country.</p>
<p>But company officials said they could not raise enough money from investors to grow and become profitable. So, they decided to close the business.</p>
<p>Adam Kramarsyck was the salmon farm's<strong> manager</strong>. He said the company did not want the fish to go to waste so it sought a way to donate them.</p>
<p>Kramarsyck said of the effort, “It's ‘lemonade out of lemons.'” The expression means to create good from a bad situation.</p>
<p>The donation is expected to provide more than 26,000 servings of hard-to-source protein for the hungry.</p>
<p>“Protein, animal protein is very, very desirable. We know that people need it for nourishment and it's difficult to get. And so this is going to make a very large<strong> impact</strong>," said McManus, the food bank chief.</p>
<p>“I don't <strong>anticipate</strong> this being here very long,'' he added. "We've had salmon before, but not like this.”</p>

<p>Scientists examining material collected from an <strong>asteroid</strong> say it appears to contain some of the chemical building blocks of life.</p>
<p>The American spacecraft OSIRIS-REx collected the <strong>samples</strong> in 2020 from the asteroid Bennu. In 2023, the spacecraft sent the rock and dust material back to Earth in a special container that landed by parachute. Scientists from the American space agency NASA recovered the samples in the western state of Utah.</p>
<p>OSIRIS-REx is already on its way to another asteroid called Apophis. It is expected to reach that asteroid in 2029.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This artist's rendering made available by NASA on shows the Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft contacting the asteroid Bennu with the Touch-And-Go Sample Arm Mechanism." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0a00-0242-b549-08dbbcfddc4a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This artist's rendering made available by NASA on shows the Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security - Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft contacting the asteroid Bennu with the Touch-And-Go Sample Arm Mechanism.</span></div>
<p>On Bennu, the spacecraft collected a total of 122 grams of material. This is believed to be the largest sample collected from beyond the moon. NASA has shared some of the material with international researchers.</p>
<p>Two research groups released studies last week describing results of their examinations of the asteroid material.</p>
<p>One <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02472-9">study</a>, published in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>, suggested the samples contained a mixture of <strong>organic</strong> compounds. Organic compounds have one or more carbon atoms that attach to other elements, usually hydrogen, oxygen, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_j4YfOxMd">nitrogen</a> and sulfur. All life on Earth is based on carbon and is built from organic compounds.</p>
<p>The other study, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08495-6">published</a> in <em>Nature</em>, provides evidence that a much larger object, which Bennu is believed to have broken off from, once held salty, liquid water.</p>
<p>The researchers said this suggests that in the early solar system, asteroids such as Bennu might have transported water and life-supporting chemicals to other planets and moons.</p>
<p>Researchers from both groups noted it was important that the samples they worked with came directly from the asteroid itself. Asteroid pieces that fall to Earth turn into meteorites, and chemicals inside the samples can be changed or lost.</p>
<p>In a statement, NASA said the findings do not provide direct evidence of life itself. However, the space agency said, “They do suggest the conditions necessary for the <strong>emergence</strong> of life were widespread across the early solar system.” This increases the chances that “life could have formed on other planets and moons,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The parent of Bennu is believed to be an icy body measuring about 100 kilometers across. Scientists believe the body formed in the outer solar system and was later destroyed, possibly 1 to 2 billion years ago. The pieces that broke off likely formed Bennu and other asteroids observed to be masses of <strong>loose</strong> material, rather than solid objects.</p>
<p>Nicky Fox is the associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington D.C. She praised the OSIRIS-REx mission, saying it was “already rewriting the textbook on what we understand about the beginnings of our solar system.”</p>
<p>Fox added that she hopes the samples can help scientists understand “what <strong>ingredients</strong> in our solar system existed before life started on Earth.”</p>
<p>Tim McCoy is a researcher at the U.S. Smithsonian Institution and was a lead writer of the <em>Nature</em> study. He told the Associated Press (AP) that the samples may provide details about "the kind of environment that could have been <strong>essential</strong> to the steps that lead from elements to life.”</p>
<p>He noted that combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich water is “really the pathway to life.” He added the samples suggest the processes involving the chemical compounds “probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before."</p>
<p>Yasuhito Sekine is with the Institute of Science in Tokyo. He did not take part in the new research. Sekine confirmed the findings were only made possible by examining samples “collected directly from the asteroid, then carefully <strong>preserved</strong> back on Earth."</p>
<p>Jason Dworkin is a project scientist for the OSIRIS-REx mission at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He told Reuters news agency that all biology is made up of organic compounds. And some of those may have survived 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>Dworkin said the materials from OSIRIS-REx provide new details about a solar system that might have had the right elements to support life. But he added that one of the most interesting questions, still remains: “Why we, so far, only see life on Earth and not elsewhere.”</p>

<p>International visitors to Israel used to visit Ein Gedi, a popular beach on the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The Dead Sea is the place on Earth's surface that is farthest below sea level.</p>
<p>Now, the beautiful desert area is in ruins beside the shrinking, salty lake.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rock patterns formed by crystalised minerals are pictured along the Dead Sea shore near Kibbutz Ein Gedi in eastern Israel on December 30, 2024. (Photo by Menahem Kahana / AFP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/08711a45-26f3-408c-9fd1-f4b5fbc0f569_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Rock patterns formed by crystalised minerals are pictured along the Dead Sea shore near Kibbutz Ein Gedi in eastern Israel on December 30, 2024. (Photo by Menahem Kahana / AFP)</span></div>
<p>The beach has been closed to the public for five years, mainly because of the appearance of dangerous holes in the ground. These holes, known as sinkholes, are caused by the collapse of the surface layer.</p>
<p>The beach has been closed because the drop in the sea's level has made it difficult to reach its waters.</p>
<p>These environmental changes are not new. The Dead Sea, where Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian territory meet, has been dying for years. With the current conflict in the Middle East, efforts to deal with the environmental problem have disappeared too.</p>
<p>Nadav Tal of the Israel office of Eco Peace, a non-profit group, told the French News Agency (AFP), "<strong>Regional </strong>cooperation is the key... to saving the Dead Sea." Tal added: "Because we are living in a conflict area, there is an <strong>obstacle</strong>." Tal described how the sea has been<strong> declining </strong>more than one meter per year since the 1960s.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental disaster </strong></p>
<p>The <strong>evaporation</strong> of the salty waters takes place partly because temperatures reach up to 50 degrees Celsius in the summer. The sea has also been affected by years of increasing water usage from the sea's main source, the Jordan River, and other smaller waterways which begin in Lebanon and Syria.</p>
<p>Local factories also use the water to get minerals -- potash, bromine, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride, among others. Tal told AFP, "The<strong> consequences</strong> of this water <strong>diversion</strong> is what we see around us.”</p>
<p>He described it as an “ecological disaster," adding that "the declining of the Dead Sea is a disaster for Israeli tourism."</p>
<p><strong>Call for joint efforts </strong></p>
<p>Efforts to deal with the Dead Sea disaster include past agreements signed by Israel and Jordan. But the wars taking place in Gaza and beyond have brought tensions to an all-time high. As a result, cross-border environmental issues are no longer getting attention.</p>
<p>At Israel's environment ministry, Ohad Carny has been working on the Dead Sea issue for years. He said the government was looking into several solutions. They include building a <strong>desalination</strong> factory and making a <strong>canal </strong>from either the north or the south to deal with water shortages in the area including the Dead Sea. But, he said, "It doesn't make economic or environmental sense to desalinate water and bring it directly to the Dead Sea, because then it's a waste of drinking water and the region needs...more drinking water and more water for agriculture.”</p>
<p>Carny said that his attention was on the Israeli side. But he added, "We can't do it alone. It must be a joint effort. So only time will tell, and we won't do anything without an agreement together with the Jordanian side."</p>
<p>Back at the Dead Sea, 40-year-old bus driver Benny is at a place where people can still visit. Benny was getting some winter sun at one of the warm sinkhole pools.</p>
<p>He said the sea's changes were difficult. "But everything has a plus and minus. Because of what is happening here, we have water spots like this one."</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" name="_Hlk81395775">On this program we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples and notes on usage.</a></p>
<p>Today we talk about different kinds of politics.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="People eating at Gotham restaurant on December 14, 2021, in New York City. (AP Photo/Brittainy Newman)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/45F04E84-B302-45E9-B677-D6B0CAB30522_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">People eating at Gotham restaurant on December 14, 2021, in New York City.

<p>We start with <u>kitchen-table politics</u>. The kitchen is often considered the hub, or center,<strong> </strong>of the home. It is where we gather to not only share a meal but to talk about the events of the day. We often discuss issues of importance with our family and friends around the <strong>dining</strong> room table.</p>
<p>So, kitchen-table issues are those that affect individuals and their families daily. A family might discuss these issues at the kitchen table during mealtimes.</p>
<p>Rising gas and food prices are two good examples of kitchen-table politics. These issues affect decisions we make day to day. They are sometimes also called <strong>dinner</strong>-table politics. Or we could describe them as bread-and-butter issues.</p>
<p>Merriam Webster dictionary defines bread-and-butter issues as “being as <strong>basic</strong> as the earning of one's <strong>livelihood</strong>.” The online Cambridge Dictionary defines a bread-and-butter issue as “a subject or problem that relates directly to most people's needs and interests.”</p>
<p>For example, <strong>affordable</strong> food prices and availability of good healthcare are the kinds of bread-and-butter political issues that people vote on.</p>
<p>The noun <u>bread and butter</u> means a way of making a living. For example, for a creative writer, her ideas are her bread and butter.</p>
<p>So, bread-and-butter political issues deal with our ability to provide for the needs of ourselves and our families.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about <u>green politics</u>. These political issues deal with caring for the natural environment. Green politics can cover ideas such as environmental <strong>sustainability</strong>, <strong>recycling</strong>,<strong> </strong>and threats to wildlife. The natural world is central to green politics.</p>
<p><u>Identity politics</u> is more personal. This term means that a person's political views are formed by their experiences and understanding of themselves. Things like <strong>gender</strong>, age, social and economic position, and religious belief can inform identity politics.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to <u>gotcha politics</u>. This type of politics is centered on damaging opponents through public accusations of wrongdoing or misbehavior. Gotcha politics often involves investigation into the private lives, past and present, of politicians in search of <strong>negative</strong> information.</p>
<p>In gotcha politics, “Gotcha” is short for “I got you,” meaning, “I caught you!”</p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>

<p>Officials in the southern U.S. state of South Carolina have recaptured the last of 43 m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s who escaped from a farm that raises m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s in early November.</p>
<p>The chief executive of Alpha Genesis research center, Greg Westergaard, said the final four recaptured m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s appeared to be in good health. The remaining m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s had spent weeks living in the woods and even experienced a rare snowstorm.</p>
<p>Alpha Genesis is a company that offers services to biomedical researchers. Some locals call it “the m<i><i>onkey</i></i> farm." The animals – all female rhesus macaque m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s – escaped from the grounds of the company on November 6.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A rhesus macaques m&lt;I&gt;&lt;I&gt;onkey&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/I&gt; observes kayakers along the Silver River in Silver Springs, Fla., Friday, Nov. 10, 2017." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/478fc63d-e6a9-4e91-ac9b-c0b1ec6cb89a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A rhesus macaques m<i><i>onkey</i></i> observes kayakers along the Silver River in Silver Springs, Fla., Friday, Nov. 10, 2017.</span></div>
<p>Police who investigated the incident said the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s escaped when an employee did not fully secure their enclosure. Westergaard explained in November that workers were supposed to <strong>lock</strong> one <strong>gate</strong> before opening another, but all three gates were left unsecure.</p>
<p>Employees at Alpha Genesis tried to persuade the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s to return with offers of special foods. These included peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and "m<i><i>onkey</i></i> <strong>biscuits</strong>" – a high-protein food made specially for rhesus macaques.</p>
<p>Alpha Genesis employees kept an eye on the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s and set out <strong>humane</strong> traps. Most of the animals came back to eat the food.</p>
<p>Most of the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s did not go far. The animals are about the size of a cat, weighing around 3 kilograms. The m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s never represented a risk to public health, police and federal health officials said. During the time they were free, the area received its first snow in seven years, measuring up to 8 centimeters.</p>
<p>The Alpha Genesis company raises the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s to sell to medical labs and other researchers. Humans have been using the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93 percent of the same DNA.</p>

            <title>What is the Best Kind of Yoga for Beginners?  (2025/2/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The activity called yoga means different things to different people around the world. The word itself comes from the Sanskrit language and means “union.”</p>
<p>For some, yoga is an exercise centered on mindful breathing and slow movement. For others, it is a series of difficult body movements and positioning designed to improve health and fitness. Still others consider yoga a spiritual exercise. And there are many people for whom yoga is a combination of all or some of these things.</p>
<p>So, yoga takes many different forms around the world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman sits in lotus prayer pose during the " at="" beach="" bruna="" copacabana="" de="" event="" in="" janeiro="" june="" on="" photo="" prado="" rio="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1d2a1895-d66c-4288-b81e-41aeb3230ea0_w268_r1.jpg" sunrise="" the="" yoga=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman sits in lotus prayer pose during the "Yoga at the Sunrise" event on Copacabana beach, in Rio de Janeiro, on June 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)</span></div>
<p>All kinds of yoga involve positions known as poses (asanas). But the positions and training can differ even under yoga methods, or styles, of the same name, including hatha, vinyasa, Iyengar and others.</p>
<p>So, what is the best kind of yoga training for a beginner?</p>
<p>“The best is the one that works for you,” said Tim Senesi, who has been teaching yoga in Orange County, California, for 22 years. “There are many different paths leading toward the same aim,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>The hatha/yin yoga styles </strong></p>
<p>Hatha, meaning “force,” describes any kind of yoga class involving asanas. A sun salutation, for example, is an important series of 12 asanas that begin many kinds of yoga classes.</p>
<p>Training under the hatha name, however, is usually gentler than others and more centered on breathing exercises, called pranayama. Poses are held for a few breaths and students usually move more slowly.</p>
<p>Hatha can be good for beginners who are looking to <strong>relax </strong>while improving <strong>flexibility </strong>and balance.</p>
<p>Another style, yin, pays even more attention to recovery by working to stretch the muscles' connective tissue. Students hold poses for 5 minutes or more, permitting the body to settle into a pose rather than pushing it.</p>
<p><strong>The vinyasa/ashtanga styles </strong></p>
<p>A more difficult, flowing form of yoga is known as vinyasa. It mixes movement with breath over a series of asanas. Some higher-level vinyasa classes move at a rate of one movement per breath.</p>
<p>In the United States, these classes are often called Flow or Power yoga. They can be good for people who are more athletic. Still, teachers suggest that even athletic students start with a beginner level.</p>
<p>“I wouldn't really <strong>encourage</strong> them to start in a higher level vinyasa flow class because they're not going to have the <strong>foundation</strong> to move safely through that,” said Anne Van Valkenburg, of Lanai, Hawaii. She has been training yoga teachers in a mix of methods for 18 years.</p>
<p>Ashtanga yoga is similar to vinyasa. However, ashtanga involves a set series of poses that students repeat day after day, often going at their own speed. As students get stronger and more skilled, they move up to a higher series with more difficult poses.</p>
<p><strong>The Iyengar style </strong></p>
<p>Iyengar style involves the same poses as vinyasa, but classes usually move at a slower pace. However, the poses are not necessarily easier. Iyengar yoga pays special attention to carefully moving or aligning parts of the body. Poses are held for longer and students often use supportive equipment during the exercise.</p>
<p>Iyengar is especially good for people recovering from injuries. It can also be a good fit for physically active people who want to get the basics of yoga before moving into different styles.</p>
<p><strong>Find a good fit </strong></p>
<p>These days, teachers often mix different yoga methods in a single class. And many classes are not named under any traditional method.</p>
<p>The AP suggests that if you are interested in starting to practice yoga, you should look for a beginner series. But if you cannot find one that is right, do not worry. Most teachers are happy to have beginners in their classes and will alter the training to meet the needs of students new to yoga.</p>
<p>Most of all, try a few classes until you find the method or teacher who is a good fit for you.</p>
<p>“I feel sad when someone tries yoga once or twice and they're like, ‘Eh, I don't like it,'” Van Valkenburg said, adding, “there's just so much out there that you might be missing...”</p>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Saeed in Iran about words that can express the idea of duty.</p>
<p>Here is Saeed's question:</p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Accountability, Responsibility, Liability" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/86e0a0ea-09ea-403a-8add-5a25cdcc43c7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Accountability, Responsibility, Liability</span></div>
<p>What is the difference between accountability, responsibility, and liability?</p>
<p>Especially from the point of view of law.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Saeed</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Saeed.</p>
<p>All three of the words you ask about express the idea of duty. A duty is what a person must do because it is right and just.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the noun “responsibility.” It is the most common word of the three, and we use it in everyday speech. However, when we talk about responsibility in legal terms, we are more likely to use the noun “duty.”</p>
<p>We often refer to a <strong>task</strong> when we use the word “responsibility” or its adjective form, “responsible.” The following examples show this:</p>
<p><em>It is a pilot's responsibility to safely fly the airplane. </em></p>
<p><em>A pilot is responsible for safely flying the airplane.</em></p>
<p>When we want to say that only one person or subject is responsible for something, we can use the adjective “sole,” spelled s-o-l-e, or the adverb “solely,” as in these examples:</p>

<p><em>The writer is <u>solely responsible for</u> what he or she posts on social media. </em></p>
<p>To express the idea that someone should agree to having a duty, we can use the expression “take responsibility for,” as in the following example:</p>
<p><em>People must <u>take responsibility for</u> their own actions. </em></p>
<p><strong>Accountability and liability</strong></p>
<p>We usually use the noun “accountability” to refer to possible <strong>penalties</strong> or bad results people may face if they do not do their duty. To do this, we use the verb “hold” before the adjective “accountable,” as in this example:</p>
<p><em>The problem was that no one in the office <u>was held accountable for </u>their actions. </em></p>
<p>We often use the noun “accountability” when discussing organizations. For example, if a business has a “system of accountability,” that means the company's leaders and workers likely face a penalty if they do not carry out their duties.</p>
<p>“Liability” is the most specific term of the three nouns. If someone or some group has legal liability, that means they have a duty that can be judged in a court of law. We use the adjective form, “liable,” to say that a person or group can face legal penalties because they were not as careful as they should have been. The following example shows this usage:</p>
<p><em>The company was <u>held liable for</u> failure to warn about the danger of its product. </em></p>
<p>Notice that we use the verb “hold” before the adjective “liable,” just like we do before the adjective “accountable.”</p>
<p>There is also a common use of the noun “liability” in everyday speech that is not linked to legal issues. We can say that something or someone is “a liability” if they make bad results more likely. The following example shows this usage:</p>
<p><em>That football player is getting old and is too slow. He has become a liability for the team.</em></p>

            <title>In India, Sudden Sea Turtle Deaths Cause Concern  (2025/1/31)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/in-india-sudden-sea-turtle-deaths-cause-concern.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">30 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Over 400 dead sea turtles have been found on India's east coast near the city of Chennai in the last two weeks. Those numbers have not been seen in more than 20 years.</p>
<p>The <strong>species</strong> of turtle is known as olive ridley. The animals travel thousands of kilometers for ideal places to lay their eggs along India's coast. But that process, called nesting, has become more difficult because undisturbed beaches are becoming harder to find around the world. And, mass deaths like these can be caused by fishing <strong>nets</strong> that can catch and harm the species.</p>
<p>Shravan Krishnan is a volunteer with Chennai-based Students Sea Turtles <strong>Conservation</strong> Network. He told The Associated Press that in a usual year, there are between 100 to 200 adult turtle deaths on the city's coast. "This year, we've already crossed 200 dead turtles in a little more than two weeks," he said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An olive ridley turtle drags sand to cover its nest after laying it at the Rushikulya River in Ganjam, India, March 13, 2015." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3ef18e6a-495d-413b-a6f8-d6da9fbfc89f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An olive ridley turtle drags sand to cover its nest after laying it at the Rushikulya River in Ganjam, India, March 13, 2015.</span></div>
<p>Krishnan is also concerned about the low number of turtles nesting on shore. He and other conservationists walk along the city's beaches at night to collect and move turtle nests. They do so to prevent the eggs from being eaten by dogs or damaged by people walking along the coast. "We have found only four nests so far, which is also really worrying," Krishnan said.</p>
<p><strong>Highest turtle deaths in the last twenty years</strong></p>
<p>Environmentalists and forest department officials have been seeing at least ten dead turtles every day for the past few days, sometimes many more. That is the highest number officials have seen since 2014. Experts say the deaths are most likely caused by large fishing nets that are pulled along the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Manish Meena is in charge of the city's wildlife. He said groups have been actively trying to inform people involved in fishing to release turtles that might get caught in nets. They have also asked the coast guard to watch for illegal fishing activity.</p>
<p>Fishing boats using giant nets that catch everything on the ocean floor are barred by a local government order from operating within five <strong>nautical miles</strong> of the coastline during the turtle nesting season. The law also requires the use of devices that can help turtles escape nets.</p>
<p>Shantanu Kalambi is an ocean animal specialist with the conservation organization ReefWatch. He said that when the turtles get caught in nets, they are unable to come up to the surface for air. And environmentalists say the crews of fishing boats do not always use the devices to help turtles escape, since they reduce how many fish they can catch.</p>
<p><strong>A number of threats</strong></p>
<p>Olive ridley turtles are considered an endangered species. Just like most sea turtles, their eggs need two months to <strong>hatch.</strong> This places them at higher risk because of coastal land activity, warmer temperatures and pollution from light.</p>
<p>Farther up India's east coast, over 500,000 turtles nest every year. But only one in about 1,000 turtle babies that hatch survives to adulthood.</p>
<p>Experts say the turtles are important to the balance of the ocean <strong>ecosystem. </strong></p>
<p>"As a species, they are millions of years old and they play an <strong>essential</strong> role in the food chain," Kalambi said.</p>

            <title>Is the Pink Substance Dropped on LA Fires Safe?  (2025/1/30)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">29 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>The efforts to battle widespread fires across Los Angeles included aircraft drops of a bright red and pink substance.</p>
<p>The material covered forests, homes, cars, and other things in the path of the wind-fueled fires. Because the substance was dropped in many <strong>residential</strong> areas, some people have wondered how safe it is.</p>
<p>The material is a fire <strong>retardant</strong>. The kind dropped around Los Angeles was mostly a product called Phos-Chek. The substance has been used by the U.S. Forest Service to fight fires since the 1960s.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An air tanker drops retardant while working to contain the Eaton Fire in Altadena, Calif., Monday, Jan. 13, 2025." src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1bebe65d-a252-4781-8b96-0678d9f00565_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An air tanker drops retardant while working to contain the Eaton Fire in Altadena, Calif., Monday, Jan. 13, 2025.</span></div>
<p>Jason Colquhoun is a 53-year-old pilot with HeliQwest, an aircraft company specializing in firefighting activities. He told the French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) that using the Barbie-pink material makes his job easier. "You can see it so easily ... it's <strong>amazing</strong>," he said.</p>
<p>Daniel McCurry is an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California. He said that in recent weeks, Phos-Chek had been dropped in residential areas more than ever before. That fact has led many to question its safety.</p>
<p>Phos-Chek is sold by fire protection equipment supplier Perimeter Solutions. It is a mixture of mostly ammonium phosphate or ammonium polyphosphate. These substances are also used to produce fertilizer. Other chemicals are added to the mixture to give it color. Perimeter told AFP the substance is designed to be one color. But it can look different depending on time of day, lighting, or smoke.</p>
<p>The bright pink color helps pilots as they try to make sure they have covered a whole area, Colquhoun explained. He noted that when pilots drop water from the air, they have to search for "the shine and the darkness" to know where to make the next drop. The colorful retardant, however, is "so much easier to spot," Colquhoun said.</p>
<p>McCurry said another reason it is better than water is that it keeps working even after the water it is mixed with dries. Phos-Chek is made thick so the wind does not blow it away and to ensure that it covers the desired area.</p>
<p>McCurry explained the substance works by forming a <strong>coating</strong> that will not burn. After the water dries up, the retardant keeps working until rain washes it into the ground. McCurry said a former firefighter told him that in a high-intensity fire the substance is "not much use." He added that the high winds driving the fires in Los Angeles may have limited its effectiveness.</p>
<p>U.S. Forest Service spokesperson Wade Muehlhof said the agency only uses retardants that meet U.S. government rules for not being harmful to animals, humans, or things living in water. He told AFP the Forest Service usually does not drop the retardant in waterways and areas home to endangered animals -- unless the fire is threatening human life or public safety. But accidents do happen, he said, and the wind may blow it into such areas.</p>
<p>McCurry said he believes Phos-Chek is “likely not harmless to the environment” now. But, he added, "On the other hand, the human health <strong>impact</strong> is still a little unclear." He noted that it would take "a lot" of retardant to poison, say, a large body of water.</p>
<p>But he said that as firefighters battled the Los Angeles fires, the substance was dropped on a lot of neighborhoods in “<strong>unprecedented</strong>”<strong> </strong>amounts. McCurry said Phos-Chek is more often used further from populated areas, or in lesser amounts. "So, who knows," he added.</p>

            <title>Scientists with Disabilities Seek Changes to Improve their Work  (2025/1/29)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">28 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>Disabled researchers often face barriers while carrying out their work. So some scientists with disabilities are seeking to increase attention about the problem and come up with workable solutions.</p>
<p>Anita Marshall is a geologist with the University of Florida. She recently told The Associated Press (AP) that while she faces some limitations, it does not mean she cannot do her job. “Just because you can't do it like someone else doesn't mean you can't do it,” she said.</p>
<p>Marshall recently led an outing of disabled researchers to a natural lake in Southern California's San Bernadino National Forest.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Taormina Lepore, foreground, who has low vision, walks with a white cane during the accessible field trip Sept. 26, 2024, in San Bernadino, Calif. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/52f9daf9-6d6d-40df-8faa-0fd4f56d6862_cx0_cy8_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>
<span class="imagecaption">Taormina Lepore, foreground, who has low vision, walks with a white cane during the accessible field trip Sept. 26, 2024, in San Bernadino, Calif. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)</span></div>
<p>The group included scientists and students with disabilities related to sight, hearing and mobility. They visited Lost Lake, which sits along the area's San Andreas Fault. The fault contains two <strong>tectonic plates</strong> that can cause earthquakes.</p>
<p>The trip was organized by Marshall's group, called the International Association for Geoscience Diversity. It aims to demonstrate the difficulties, or challenges, disabled researchers often face. Other groups also aim to improve <strong>access </strong>to field and laboratory work so those with disabilities feel welcome and stay.</p>
<p>Taormina Lepore is a Western Michigan University paleontologist who went on the trip. She told the AP that one problem is that many scientists seem to value a single, traditional way of doing their work. This makes it more difficult to get changes for disabled researchers.</p>
<p>On the trip to Lost Lake, everyone got to see the lake even if they could not get there physically. Some attendees saw the surroundings on video taken by a drone.</p>
<p>Lepore, who also researches science education, said an important part of the process is for scientists to think about what might help other scientists they work with. “It's really about <strong>empathy</strong>, as much as it is about science.”</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation said in 2021 that disabled people make up about three percent of the science, technology, engineering, and math workforce.</p>
<p>Scientists with disabilities say the low percentage is partly because labs, classrooms and field areas are not designed for disabled individuals.</p>
<p>Mark Leddy used to oversee disability-related <strong>grants </strong>for the National Science Foundation. He noted that some students and <strong>faculty </strong>are still told they cannot work in a lab or do research safely.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 does set rules for new buildings and labs. These include requiring <strong>ramps </strong>and walkways that can be used by people in wheelchairs. But making changes to older labs can be costly and difficult.</p>
<p>Alyssa Paparella is working on her doctorate degree in biology at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. She founded an online community for disabled scientists. Paparella said a science building at one of her former schools did not have the needed buttons to open the doors. “That's the front door that they're not even able to get in.”</p>
<p>Leddy said researchers with disabilities are invaluable because of their life experiences. They have to come up with creative ways to get past barriers in their lives — a problem-solving skill that is needed in a lab.</p>
<p>Jennifer Piatek is a professor of Earth and Space Sciences at Central Connecticut State University. She uses a wheelchair but was able to see through drone video.</p>
<p>Piatek said it was nice to be part of a community that took her needs into account. You can learn a lot from images and maps, “but really you need to get to the space to be in it.”</p>
<p>Western Michigan's Lepore is a <strong>neurodivergent</strong> person with low vision. She noted, “Nature is not <strong>inherently </strong>accessible.”</p>
<p>Bushra Hussaini works at New York City's American Museum of Natural History. She told the AP that by going on field trips, she learns new ways to support <strong>interns </strong>and volunteers who visit the museum. She said the supportive community of geologists is what keeps her coming back. “We learn from each other and we help each other.”</p>
<p>As a doctoral student, Marshall went on field trips with other students. But she often had to wait in the car because the organizers had not thought about her disabilities. Marshall wants things to be different for the next generation of scientists. “The whole point of these little day trips is to just plant that seed out there...that there's another way forward,” she said.</p>

            <title>How to Protect Against Increased Viral Spread in Winter  (2025/1/28)</title>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Influenza, or the flu, COVID-19, norovirus and the common cold easily spread throughout the winter season.</p>
<p>Knowing what these infections are and how they spread can help us avoid them. The Associated Press has listed some things anyone can do to keep healthy and to know more about these infections:</p>
<p><strong>Cold, flu, or COVID?</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1b9b0c9f-5a06-4670-aadc-dd16870c7d70_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A flu vaccine is displayed at a pharmacy in New York, on Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon, File)</span></div>
<p>Some signs, or symptoms, of a cold, the flu, COVID-19 or norovirus are similar. This can make it hard to know what is making us sick.</p>
<p>However, some symptoms are unmistakable.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html">Norovirus</a> spreads through polluted food, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_QgPoTeZo">water</a> and surfaces, including the skin. The virus causes <strong>vomiting</strong>, <strong>diarrhea</strong>, and stomach pain. The sickness can last for about one to three days.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/common-cold/about/index.html">common cold</a> can be caused by several different kinds of viruses and can include several symptoms. These include a runny nose, <strong>congestion</strong>, <strong>cough</strong>, <strong>sneezing</strong>, and pain in the throat, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_VBZd1fld">head</a> and other parts of the body. It can also cause higher than normal body temperature, or a fever. The common cold usually lasts less than a week.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html">flu</a> is caused by influenza viruses that are always changing. Infection leads to fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body <strong>aches</strong>, headaches and feeling tired. Flu symptoms usually hit more quickly than cold symptoms. They can last from a few days to two weeks.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html">COVID-19</a> can cause fever, <strong>chills</strong>, cough, congestion, tiredness and throat and head pain. Other signs of COVID are the loss of smell or taste, difficulty breathing, nausea, or vomiting. The sickness can last for several days.</p>
<p>The respiratory syncytial virus, or <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/symptoms/index.html">RSV</a>, can make people sick for one or two weeks. The signs include runny nose, congestion, coughing, sneezing, breathing problems, fever, and a loss of <strong>appetite</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wash your hands</strong></p>
<p>So how can we avoid infections? Experts say people should wash their hands carefully and often with a cleanser such as soap. Clean hands are very important to reducing the spread of norovirus, colds, flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says this is especially true after using the bathroom, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_vYnFPopf">eating</a> or preparing food.</p>
<p>Make sure you take enough time to wash your hands. It should take at least 20 seconds to complete the job.</p>
<p>If you do not have soap and water available, cleansers called hand sanitizers are a good substitute. The sanitizer must be at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective against most of these viruses. An exception is norovirus which requires a stronger sanitizer.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning surfaces can remove viruses</strong></p>
<p>To avoid norovirus, you must immediately clean surfaces that have come in contact with infected food or bodily fluids. The CDC advises disinfecting things with a chlorine bleach solution or <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/epas-registered-antimicrobial-products-effective-against-norovirus-feline">one of the products listed on the Environmental Protection Agency website</a>.</p>
<p>Do not forget to wash any clothing that has come in contact with vomit or other bodily waste. Use hot water and soap. Then, wash your hands again.</p>
<p>With colds and flu, it is best to repeatedly clean surfaces that are touched or used often. These include doorknobs, light switches, kitchen workspaces, children's playthings, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_BaPXCDc6">cellphones</a> and other objects around the home.</p>
<p>Use household cleaning products that contain soap or detergent and follow up with a sanitizer. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/hygiene/about/when-and-how-to-clean-and-disinfect-your-home.html#:~:text=Clean%20first%20and%20clean%20regularly,viruses%20or%20bacteria%20from%20surfaces.">The CDC has more advice on how to clean</a>.</p>
<p>COVID-19 spreads through the air in small drops and particles. The CDC says there is low risk of getting the virus from surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your hands off your face can keep viruses out</strong></p>
<p>Viruses can spread through talking, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_98beP7cn">coughing</a> and sneezing, so cover your mouth with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. Then, wash your hands.</p>
<p>Do not touch your face. If you have viruses on your unwashed hands and touch your face, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_NHfUg1Ij">eyes</a> or nose, they can get into your body. Your likelihood of getting sick will increase.</p>
<p><strong>Consider a vaccine (if there is one)</strong></p>
<p>You might consider a vaccine if one is available.</p>
<p>Updated COVID-19 vaccines are available. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-flu-rsv-vaccines-shots-ad33f4fe23f4c293ab87415b6449d9ad">Yearly flu shots</a> for people 6 months and older are also available. For adults 60 and older or people who are pregnant, you might want to get the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/prevention.html">RSV vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine for norovirus or the common cold.</p>
<p><strong>Another way to keep your defenses against viruses up: Rest</strong></p>
<p>Your immune system may not work as well if you are lacking enough sleep, water or are experiencing high levels of tension. Rest. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://apnews.com/article/sleep-stress-anxiety-caffeine-alcohol-35dfa5725a0fdefae0b18d5442e55cb3">Sleep</a>. And drink enough water.</p>
<p><strong>Stay at home</strong></p>
<p>If you do get sick, you can take a test to find out if you have COVID-19 or influenza. It is important to know if you have a virus that could be treated with available medicines. The drug Paxlovid treats COVID-19. Tamiflu is used to treat flu.</p>
<p>Above all, if you have symptoms of any of these sicknesses, stay at home and away from other people. This will help stop the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>To treat a cold, flu or COVID-19, rest and drink fluids. You can take pain medicine to lower a fever or to ease pain. Humidifier machines, which increase the amount of water in the air, can also help ease symptoms.</p>
<p>There is no medication for norovirus. You need to replace fluids lost because of <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_Y8uzUGms">the sickness</a>. Drink as much water and other liquids as possible. Seek medical help if you notice you have a dry mouth and throat, are not expelling liquid waste easily, or feel <strong>dizzy</strong> when standing.</p>

<p>There is a growing movement worldwide to use plants in building design to establish closer connections with nature and soften hard city <strong>styles</strong>. The movement also seeks to improve designs to help protect the environment and increase personal wellness.</p>
<p>Many of the efforts by <strong>architects</strong> and designers have centered on one natural element: trees.</p>
<p>Examples of such design can be found in many places, including New York City. A building in Manhattan that houses the Ford Foundation has a 12-story light-filled entrance area, or atrium. It is also filled with plants and flowers including magnolias, eucalyptus, jacaranda, cryptomeria, iron bark and pear trees.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by KAA Design Group shows the Tree House's primary suite private courtyard with Japanese wood soaking tub and reflecting pool.

<p>Another example sits within New York City's Brookfield Place shopping center. The center's main atrium includes a collection of 12-meter-tall Washingtonia palm trees.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the city-state's Jewel Changi airport offers travelers an inviting environment. It has 2,500 trees native to nations including Madagascar, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia. The airport includes a 2.4-hectare indoor forest with walking paths.</p>
<p>Some <strong>apartments</strong> and mixed-use buildings are also putting trees and other greenery into their designs. Such buildings are sometimes called “greenscrapers,” a term that comes from the word “<strong>skyscraper.”</strong></p>
<p>In Milan, Italy, architect Stefano Boeri designed Bosco Verticale, a 44-story building with 800 trees and other greenery. In the Netherlands, he also built the Trudo Vertical Forest. This is a low-income apartment building with trees growing on all sides.</p>
<p>Similar changes are also happening inside private homes. In some, trees are brought right indoors. In others, outdoor trees are carefully placed as important partners in the building plan.</p>
<p>Some architects even build homes around existing trees. Others plant one or more trees inside the home. And some architects or designers imagine natural settings indoors by using parts of trees. These designs are meant to create the look and feel of real wood, while bringing feelings of peace and calm.</p>
<p><strong>A calm heart of the home</strong></p>
<p>Ryoko Okada is an architect at New York City's Oda Architecture. She told The Associated Press that she and her co-workers aim to bring outdoor elements indoors as often as they can.</p>
<p>“There's nothing more calming than being surrounded by nature...” Okada said. She added that a living tree indoors can bring peace and happiness as people watch it grow and change.</p>
<p><strong>Framing the views with existing trees</strong></p>
<p>Another design example came from KAA Design Group in Los Angeles. A team from the company created a modern home that uses the property's existing trees, such as cork oaks, rare Torrey pines, and magnolias.</p>
<p>One very large, old cork oak sits in the center of the property. At first, the owners did not like the look and said they wanted the tree gone. One of the company's partners, Grant Kirkpatrick, had to persuade the homeowners to keep it. Kirkpatrick explained he succeeded by pointing out that the tree was “a 300-year-old <strong>antique</strong> that should be <strong>featured </strong>rather than removed.”</p>
<p>The driveway on that property also offers a calming design. A black pine tree rises up from the driveway like a piece of natural art. In addition, views from almost every window in the house feature the beautiful nature outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Things to consider</strong></p>
<p>Okada says she suggests people do not plant a full-size tree in their home without first seeking expert advice. She notes that a living tree will only do well if certain conditions – such as air, light and soil – are right.</p>
<p>Okada added that a living tree “...needs to be supported by proper <strong>infrastructure</strong> to stay alive and avoid home damage.” She also urges people to heavily research a tree's natural environment to avoid drawing in unwanted <strong>pests</strong>.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick noted that planting a tree indoors can be difficult. He explained that at least 1.2 meters of soil depth is needed, along with lots of natural light and the right temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to use trees besides having a live one</strong></p>
<p>Kirkpatrick said he worked on one property that experienced a serious fire in 2016. His team decided to use parts from one of the burned manzanita trees in the interior design. The piece was painted black and placed inside the property. He said it now represents an eye-catching, natural art piece.</p>

            <title>The American South Gets ‘Once-in-a Lifetime’ Snow and Cold  (2025/1/28)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/the-american-south-gets-once-in-a-lifetime-snow-and-cold.mp3"/>

<p>People in the southern U.S. state of Florida are used to warm, sunny weather. But on January 21, Floridians saw a rare sight: snow on their beaches. A cold weather system brought snow to several southern states in what many are calling a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p>
<p>So much snow fell across the American South that snowballs flew on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, and children and parents used any kind of plastic they could find to slide down snow-covered hills along the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported that 24.9 centimeters of snow fell near the small town of Milton, Florida. That breaks the snowfall record of 10.1 centimeters from 1954.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An ice covered fountain sits in front of a Mardi Gras festooned skeleton the day after a rare and record setting snowstorm in River Ridge, La., a suburb of New Orleans, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f02d36d4-0a04-4a0e-8af1-7b62d1203c79_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An ice covered fountain sits in front of a Mardi Gras festooned skeleton the day after a rare and record setting snowstorm in River Ridge, La., a suburb of New Orleans, Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. </span></div>
<p>"It's an incredible, incredible event," said Michael Mugrage. Mugrage is a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Mobile, Alabama. That is where many of the highest snowfall numbers from the South were reported. "It puts it in <strong>perspective</strong> how rare this is."</p>
<p>Milton is northeast of Pensacola, Florida, where 22.6 centimeters broke the city's previous all-time snow record of 7.6 centimeters set in 1895.</p>
<p>Here are some places reporting rare snowfall events:</p>
<p><strong>New Orleans, Louisiana</strong></p>
<p>The National Weather Service reported that in some parts of New Orleans, 25 centimeters of snow fell. That broke the city's record of 6.8 centimeters from 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Houston, Texas</strong></p>
<p>In Texas, up to 10 centimeters of snow fell in the Houston area. The area reportedly does not own any trucks with snow-moving equipment known as snowplows.</p>
<p><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong></p>
<p>More than 10 centimeters of snow fell in and around Charleston, South Carolina, where snow closed the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile, Alabama</strong></p>
<p>At Mobile Regional Airport in Alabama, 15.7 centimeters of snow was recorded, breaking the city's one-day snowfall record of 12.7 centimeters. The record was set on January 24, 1881, the weather service said. A reported snowfall total of 28 centimeters in the small town of Babbie in southern Alabama was among the highest nationwide for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cold and snowy</strong></p>
<p>It was very cold in Mobile, too. The National Weather Service said a low of <strong>minus</strong> 14 Celsius tied the third-coldest low temperature record for the city, set in 1899. In Louisiana, all-time records for low temperatures were reported in the cities of New Iberia and Lafayette. Wednesday's low of minus 17 Celsius in New Iberia broke a record that had stood since 1962. Lafayette's low of minus 16 Celsius broke a record that dates back to 1899.</p>
<p>Across several southern states, flights were cancelled, and some highways were closed.</p>
<p><strong>Europe's climate agency reports record high temperatures</strong></p>
<p>The record snowfall and low temperatures did not affect the entire world. The AP reports Europe's Copernicus climate service data shows the first 20 days of January 2025 had the highest average temperature worldwide recorded for the first 20 days of any year.</p>
<p>So far this year, U.S. weather has set or equaled 697 daily records for coldest temperatures. That is close to the 629 daily records that have been reported so far this year for warmest temperatures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that in the past 365 days, U.S. weather stations have recorded five times as many heat records as cold records.</p>
<p>Scientists say they seem to be seeing more cool air but not cooler weather. Some scientists hold the theory that warm temperatures in the Arctic area are displacing cold air which is pushed further south.</p>

<p>Two American astronauts awaiting their return flight from the International Space Station (ISS) have stayed busy carrying out a series of scientific experiments.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency NASA has said the pair – Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams – will remain at the ISS until late March or early April. When they arrived at the orbiting laboratory in June 2024, the astronauts expected to stay in space for just one week.</p>
<p>Their trip was a test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. While Starliner safely transported the two to the ISS, the spacecraft had several problems that persuaded NASA to send it back to Earth for further testing without the astronauts onboard.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this photo provided by NASA, Boeing Crew Flight Test astronauts Butch Wilmore, left, and Suni Williams pose inside the International Space Station's Harmony module and Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 13, 2024.

(NASA via AP)</span></div>
<p>NASA's current plan calls for Wilmore and Williams to fly back on a SpaceX spacecraft in late March at the earliest. NASA has been using SpaceX's Crew Dragon to regularly carry astronauts and supplies to the ISS since 2020.</p>
<p>The astronauts have been using their extended mission to carry out experiments. In addition, Williams stepped out of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/">the space station</a> earlier this month to complete a spacewalk.</p>
<p>Another NASA astronaut, Nick Hague, joined Williams on the spacewalk on January 16, the agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/suni-williams-conducts-spacewalk/#:~:text=NASA%20astronaut%20Suni%20Williams%20is,and%20the%20eighth%20for%20Williams.">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>The two repaired a piece of equipment that helps guide the movements of the ISS. The spacewalk also included work on an X-ray telescope, as well as maintenance activities for other ISS systems. NASA noted it was the fourth spacewalk for Hague and the eighth for Williams.</p>
<p>The space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/">said</a> Williams was preparing for another spacewalk planned for January 30. Wilmore is expected to join Williams on that spacewalk, which NASA estimates will last about six-and-a-half hours. The two will be aiming to remove <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_FkQDXp0z">a radio</a> <strong>antenna </strong>structure. They will also be “searching for microbes” around the ISS for use in experiments.</p>
<p>Here is a look at other experiments Wilmore and Williams have completed during their stay:</p>
<p><strong>New methods to grow food</strong></p>
<p>NASA said Wilmore and Williams have tested different methods for growing crops in space. Such methods could support humans who have longer stays in space in the future.</p>
<p>One experiment is called the Plant Water Management investigation. NASA said this experiment “uses the physical properties of fluids...to overcome the lack of gravity and provide <strong>hydration</strong> to plants.” The experiment aims to help NASA develop <strong>hydroponic</strong> systems to support future space missions.</p>
<p>Another experiment examines a new way to grow vegetables, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_4036MWWQ">plants</a> and flowers inside the ISS to provide nutrition and beauty. As part of this experiment, Wilmore <strong>installed</strong> a new light <strong>meter</strong> inside the ISS. The device is designed to measure available light and to help crew members improve growing operations.</p>
<p><strong>Robot assistants</strong></p>
<p>NASA also said that throughout the current mission, Williams had deployed and observed three free-flying robots called Astrobee. This robotic experiment seeks to examine how such robots could assist astronauts with daily duties and <strong>maintenance</strong> work.</p>
<p>The agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/station/research-explorer/facility/?#id=1891">said</a> the square-shaped robots are designed to help scientists and engineers develop and test new robotic technologies for use in microgravity environments. The assistants are also designed to help astronauts with daily tasks “and give ground controllers additional eyes and ears on the space station.”</p>
<p>Williams tested the robots' ability to map the inside of the space station and Astrobee's flight abilities.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p><strong>Image captures from space</strong></p>
<p>NASA astronauts visiting the ISS have a long history of capturing images of Earth from space. And this is another activity Wilmore and Williams have carried out. The ISS gives astronauts a “window to the world” as they orbit 400 kilometers above their home planet.</p>
<p>During their mission, NASA said the two astronauts had “captured hundreds of photographs of Earth, ranging from <strong>auroras</strong>, land, sea, orbital sunrises and sunsets, and more.”</p>
<p><strong>Radio connections with Earth </strong></p>
<p>Another space station tradition is for U.S. astronauts to connect with students and other interested individuals during their stay in space. They have <strong>virtual</strong> visits with people back on Earth who can ask the astronauts how it feels to live in space and can learn about NASA's experiments aboard the ISS.</p>
<p>In early August, Williams used <strong>ham radio</strong> technology to connect with students from Banda Aceh, Indonesia. NASA explained that students get the chance to communicate with the astronauts when the ISS passes overhead. The students can ask about research on the ISS as well as the radio wave technology that makes <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_vqekhKzO">the communication</a> possible.</p>

<p>In flooded agricultural fields near the Tennessee River, tens of thousands of birds called sandhill cranes search for food such as berries, corn, seeds and insects.</p>
<p>The Cranes come to the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge Center in northern Alabama during the winter. The yearly movement, or migration, of sandhill cranes brings many birdwatchers who want to see the tall birds up close.</p>
<p>The birdwatchers also come to see the rare and endangered whooping cranes that migrate in much smaller numbers to Wheeler. Many other birds can be seen, including geese, ducks, bald eagles, kestrels and hawks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Rob Broeren takes pictures of sandhill cranes at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Decatur, Ala. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c30c8162-eff9-46e9-80b1-895371d27902_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Rob Broeren takes pictures of sandhill cranes at the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge, Monday, Jan. 13, 2025, in Decatur, Ala. (AP Photo/George Walker IV)</span></div>
<p>Park ranger David Young described the area as “a birder's paradise,” meaning it is a perfect place for birdwatchers.</p>
<p>The cranes fly from the Great Lakes, an area far to the north, to Alabama each year.</p>
<p>The sandhill cranes started migrating to Wheeler for the winter in the mid-1990s. Their numbers increased by a lot in the mid-2000s, Young said. Last year, the migratory sandhill population reached a new record of 30,000 cranes.</p>
<p>The refuge has become a popular place for birdwatchers who bring hand-held telescopes called binoculars. Birdwatchers can even get closer to the 1.2-meter-tall cranes as visitors stay hidden behind photography <strong>blinds</strong> and a two-level observation center. A yearly Festival of the Cranes in January brings more attention and visitors.</p>
<p>The cranes put on a fun show, dancing on their thin legs, moving their wings and putting their long beaks in the air to make different sounds.</p>
<p>Diana Maybury-Sharp regularly comes to Wheeler with friends to <strong>hike</strong> and look at birds.</p>
<p>“It's pretty<strong> extraordinary</strong>. I've seen them in other parts of the country where there were just a few,” Maybury-Sharp said. “They're not<strong> vocal</strong> like they are here. There's so many here that it's an unusual experience.”</p>
<p>The whooping cranes are part of the eastern migratory population that comes from the north-central state of Wisconsin. Young said they started coming to Alabama in 2004. Their population is between 12 and 20 each winter.</p>
<p>Whooping cranes nearly died out in the early 1900s because of hunting and farming. The International Crane Foundation says recovery and reintroduction efforts have slowly increased their wild and captive populations to more than 800.</p>
<p>The whooping cranes are sometimes hard to see among the sandhills, but their height and white feathers help them stand out. Young said the migration patterns of the cranes might change depending on the climate of both their <strong>nesting </strong>places to the north and their winter homes in the south.</p>
<p>Rob Broeren brought along his camera and a long telephoto lens and found a good place to work on his wildlife photography skills. He comes to the refuge about twice a month each year to photograph the birds and ducks.</p>
<p>“You just need to be patient and wait for them to do something interesting and make their calls,” Broeren said. “You get that cool shot and that's a good day.”</p>
<p>The sandhill cranes will start leaving the refuge in mid-February. Young said he notices a lot more activity when the birds are showing they are ready to travel back to their nesting grounds.</p>
<p>“It's usually on a day when we have some sort of a south wind," Young said. "They're smart and they will ride the wind back to their breeding grounds whenever it's most <strong>convenient</strong> for them.”</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, winter brings cold temperatures and, in some places, snowfall. For people who like planting things, gardening may seem far away.</p>
<p>However, during winter weather, there are still things a gardener can do to prepare for the spring. Gardening expert Jessica Damiano recently wrote about such preparatory <strong>tasks</strong> for the Associated Press. We can also call these tasks "prep work."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Snow covers the yard of a home in the Grant Park neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, Feburary 23, 2023. (AP Photo/Drew Callister)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/04537a8f-10d8-4bfb-94bf-d5193765e81b_cx0_cy12_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Snow covers the yard of a home in the Grant Park neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, Feburary 23, 2023.

<p><strong>Testing seeds</strong></p>
<p>First let's talk about seeds.</p>
<p>If you have seed <strong>packets</strong>, she suggests checking their <strong>expiration</strong> date. That is the date by which they go “bad” or will not grow. Damiano says the seeds are usually considered “fresh” within a year of being <strong>packaged</strong>. But they can be used for longer than that.</p>
<p>However, you cannot be sure if the seeds are still good just by looking at a date. She suggests testing them.</p>
<p>To do this, she places several seeds on a wet paper towel and then puts that into a plastic container. In about 10 days, she will look to see how many seeds have <strong>sprouted. </strong></p>
<p>This gives her an idea of how many seeds to use to get the desired number of plants. However, if less than 50 percent of the seeds sprout, she throws them away.</p>
<p>Damiano tests her old seeds in the winter before the busy spring gardening season. That is when seed and plant stores, or nurseries, can run out of seeds.</p>
<p><strong>Inspect and care for equipment</strong></p>
<p>She also inspects her gardening equipment.</p>
<p>For example, if you use grow lights — lights especially made for plants — make sure they still work. You might have to buy new <strong>bulbs</strong>.</p>
<p>Damiano brings out her grow lights and inspects each bulb. If necessary, she will order replacement bulbs. That way she is prepared to plant at any time, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_xunw7UCS">even</a> six to eight weeks in the future.</p>
<p>She also makes sure she has <strong>sterile</strong> seed-starting potting mix. This is special soil for planting in containers.</p>
<p>Damiano sharpens her cutting tools, such as pruning shears. Larger tools like lawnmowers should be inspected every year. Like nurseries, places that service lawn equipment might be busier in the spring. You can get ahead of the crowd by getting your tools fixed early.</p>
<p>Clean your gardening hand tools, like trowels and spades. Cover them lightly with oil. This will help keep them in good working order.</p>
<p>Inspect things like hoses, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_cHp8ajPN">sprinklers</a> and other water systems for damage. Make a list of anything you may need to replace or repair.</p>
<p>Damiano says that you could wait until spring to take care of all these things—but why? Once spring arrives, you will have these tasks done.</p>
<p>And that's the Health &amp; Lifestyle report. I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we talk about our busy lives. Many people have family and work responsibilities. We might have religious or community activities. Taking care of our health is also important. And let's not forget about our personal projects, our interests, and our friendships.</p>
<p>With everything <u>on our plate</u>, it is easy to feel <strong>overwhelmed</strong>, overextended, and <strong>overcommitted</strong>.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="During the coronavirus pandemic, many resources were spread very thin.

<p>However, if we try to do too much, we may <u>spread ourselves too thin</u>. This expression means we have taken on too much. We are <u>pushed to the limit</u>.</p>
<p>People who are<u> spread too thin</u>, take on too many jobs, projects, or goals. The heavy load requires more energy or attention than they possess.</p>
<p>If we work on many projects simultaneously, or at the same time, it is possible that none will get done well, if they get done at all. And it is possible such <strong>multitasking</strong> could <strong>stress </strong>us out.</p>
<p>Being spread too thin can also be described as <u>biting off more than we can chew</u>. When we bite off more than we can chew, we attempt to do more than is possible.</p>

<p><small>Here is a VOA Learning English <em>English in a Minute</em> video explaining the idiom "to bite off more than you can chew."</small></p>
<p>Now, let's hear these some of these terms and expressions used in a <strong>conversation</strong>.</p>
<p><em>A: So, how are your classes going?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Not great. Many of my best students are failing my course. They all missed an important deadline for a project. </em></p>
<p><em>A: That's strange. What else do they have going on?</em></p>
<p><em>B: A lot! They are all performing in the same play. So, they have had <strong>rehearsals</strong> every night for the past month. And many have part-time jobs as well. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Sounds like they've spread themselves too thin. They've got too much going on. </em></p>
<p><em>B: I think you're right. </em></p>
<p><em>A: So, what are you going to do?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Well, first I'll extend the deadline. And then I'm going to warn them about biting off more than they can chew. </em></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Archeological research has uncovered another treasure of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii: a large private <strong>bathhouse</strong>.</p>
<p>The explosion of Mount Vesuvius in 70 AD buried Pompeii in thick ash, wreckage, and lava, or hot liquid rock. Archeologists are continuing to find remains of the city under the ground.</p>
<p>The bathhouse was part of a large private house, the scientists said. The bathhouse holds a series of rooms that would have provided hot, warm, or cold conditions. The art and design of the complex, including <strong>mosaic</strong> works, also suggest the owner was wealthy.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A picture released by the Pompeii Archeological Park Press Office, Friday, January 17, 2025, showing a private bathhouse recently discovered in the Pompeii archeological site.

(Archeological Park of Pompeii Press Office Via AP, HO)</span></div>
<p>“We have here perhaps the largest<strong> thermal</strong> complex in a private house in Pompeii,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.</p>
<p>He explained that Pompeii's powerful and wealthy set up large spaces at their homes to hold major gatherings for ceremonies and other purposes.</p>
<p>“It was an <strong>opportunity</strong> to show the wealth in which they lived and also to have a nice thermal treatment," he said.</p>
<p>The baths were unearthed in the so-called Regio IX, a large central area of Pompeii Park that is still unexplored.</p>
<p>Recently, archeologists working in the same area found a <strong>bakery</strong>, a <strong>laundry</strong> and two homes. They also found the bones of three people who died in the volcanic burst.</p>
<p>Pompeii was not the only city destroyed in the explosion. It also buried the city of Herculaneum.</p>
<p>Zuchtriegel said wealthy citizens of Pompeii often would first take a bath and then attend a banquet, or a big meal. The private thermal complex permitted them to do so together at the home where the banquet was held.</p>
<p>“There is room for about 30 people who could do the whole <strong>routine</strong>, and that could also be done in public baths. So there is the caldarium, a very warm environment, and also a large <strong>tub</strong> with cold water,” he said.</p>

<p>This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em> we answer a question from Doraemon in Japan. Here is Doraemon's question:</p>
<p><em>Hi VOA,</em></p>
<p><em>For me, as an English learner, words like clash, crash, and crush sound like the same word.<br/>
Can you help me to tell one word from others?<br/>
Thank you.</em><em> </em></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ask a Teacher: Minimal Pairs for Pronunciation" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c708a5b5-901a-473a-884f-4201ea6b2eeb_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Ask a Teacher: Minimal Pairs for Pronunciation</span></div>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Doraemon.</p>
<p>When a foreign language contains sounds that do not exist in a person's native language, it can be difficult for learners to hear those sounds.</p>
<p>The reason you have difficulty hearing the difference between “crash” and “clash” is because the Japanese language does not have the consonant sounds “r” or “l.” And when English speakers are talking quickly, the difference between the sounds of “r” and “l” becomes very small. As a result, those two consonants can sound the same to a native Japanese speaker.</p>
<p>Some vowel sounds can also be difficult to hear or pronounce depending on the vowels a person's native language has. For example, consider the difference between the following two words:</p>
<p><em>hit heat</em></p>
<p>The Spanish language has the vowel sound in the word “heat,” but it does not have the vowel sound in the word “hit.”</p>
<p>As a result, Spanish speakers will sometimes pronounce words like “hit,” “bit,” and “little” with an “ee” sound. For example, the two words “hit” and “heat” will both sound like “heat” when spoken with a Spanish <strong>accent</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Train your ears using minimal pairs</strong></p>
<p>You can learn to hear the difference between sounds in a foreign language by careful <strong>practice</strong> using minimal pairs. Minimal pairs are two words that differ from each other by only one sound.</p>
<p>For example, the two words “hit” and “heat” differ from each other by only one sound.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for using minimal pairs:</p>
<p>Find lists and recordings of minimal pairs through a Google search or on YouTube. For Japanese speakers, find minimal pairs that differ between the sounds of “r” and “l.” Be sure to include minimal pairs that place the two sounds at the beginning, middle, and end of words. Here are examples:</p>
<p><em>rake lake</em></p>
<p><em>correct collect</em></p>
<p><em>hair hail</em></p>
<p>Carefully listen to the pronunciation of the minimal pairs. At first, it might be difficult for you to hear the difference between them. But over time you will start hearing the difference.</p>
<p>Also practice pronouncing these sounds. Learning to pronounce them can help you hear them. To pronounce them, you need to practice putting your tongue in the correct position.</p>
<p>The tongue is a muscle. Just as we can train our muscles to play a sport, we can train our tongue to move to the correct positions for pronouncing a foreign language. This <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94MMQ1av_-s">How to Pronounce video</a> from VOA Learning English shows the tongue positions you need to pronounce the letters “r” and “l” correctly.</p>

<p>A group of sheep on farmland in the American state of Texas work together to complete a job: eating the grass growing beneath hundreds of<strong> solar panels.</strong></p>
<p>Sheep have become a<strong> symbol </strong>of a growing solar industry as large-scale solar farms appear across the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Solar grazing </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Sheep walk near solar panels on a solar farm owned by SB Energy on Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024, in Buckholts, Texas. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a524fb24-ab1f-4d74-b382-0600d7b1c1c9_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Sheep walk near solar panels on a solar farm owned by SB Energy on Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2024, in Buckholts, Texas. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)</span></div>
<p>In Milam County, Texas, SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country. It can produce 900 megawatts of power across 1,618 hectares.</p>
<p>So, how does the company deal with all the grass that grows on such a large piece of land? It deploys about 3,000 sheep that keep the grass cover low. Sheep, unlike devices such as lawnmowers, can fit between small spaces and work in all kinds of weather conditions.</p>
<p>The work of the sheep, and sometimes other animals, is called solar grazing. It is considered part of the larger idea of agrivoltaics --- the use of land for both solar energy production and agriculture.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/agrivoltaics-coming-soon-farm-near-you#:~:text=Agrivoltaics%20is%20the%20use%20of,workers%20on%20hot%20summer%20days." target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> suggests that solar grazing may help the environment in several ways. These include making grassy areas safer for wild animals, like nesting ground birds, and by reducing fuel use and air pollution.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics is on the rise with more than 60 solar grazing projects in the U.S., the National Renewable Energy Laboratory says. The American Solar Grazing Association says 27 states take part in solar grazing.</p>
<p><strong>A sunny opportunity </strong></p>
<p>Putting the animals to work on solar fields also provides some help to the sheep and <strong>wool</strong> market, which has struggled in recent years. The number of sheep and lambs in Texas fell to 655,000 in January 2024, a 4 percent drop from the year before. That information comes from the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often good for animals to eat grass on, the power plants have been used in cooperation with farmers rather than against them.</p>
<p>Sheep farmer JR Howard accidentally found himself in the middle of Texas' move to clean energy. In 2021, he and his family began working with solar farms. Howard's sheep ate the grass on these large areas of land.</p>
<p>What was once a small business has turned into a larger operation with more than 8,000 sheep and 26 employees.</p>
<p>“Just the growth has been kind of crazy for us,” said Howard, who named his company Texas Solar Sheep. “It's been great for me and my family.”</p>
<p><strong>Following the herd </strong></p>
<p>Some agriculture experts say Howard's success shows how solar farms have become a big help for some <strong>ranchers</strong>.</p>
<p>Reid Redden is a sheep farmer and solar <strong>vegetation</strong> manager in San Angelo, Texas. Redden said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly hard to find.</p>
<p>“Solar grazing is probably the biggest <strong>opportunity</strong> that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations,” Redden said.</p>
<p>Redden suggested that people in the rural communities near where he raises sheep have been very positive about solar grazing.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics itself is not new. Solar farms use a lot of land and require a lot of space that could be used for food production.</p>
<p>Agrivoltaics helps with the problem by permitting the two industries to coexist, whether growing food or caring for livestock.</p>
<p>There is a lot still unknown about the full effects of solar grazing, said Nuria Gomez-Casanovas of Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>Not enough studies have been done to know the long-term environmental effects, such as how good the soil will be for future agriculture. However, Gomez-Casanovas suspects solar grazing may improve sheep productivity.</p>
<p>“We really have more questions than answers,” Gomez-Casanovas said.</p>

            <title>Researchers: Female Family Ties Important to Social Networks  (2025/1/23)</title>

<p>A recent study suggests that female family ties were central to social networks in ancient Celtic society before the Roman invasion.</p>
<p>Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in Britain shows that women were closely related. At the same time, unrelated men were more likely to come into the community from other places, likely after marriage.</p>
<p>For the study, researchers examined ancient DNA from 57 burial places in Dorset in southwestern England. People used the cemetery from around 2100 years ago to around 1800 years ago.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This photo provided by Bournemouth University in January 2025 shows burials being investigated at an Iron Age Celtic cemetery as part of the Durotriges tribe project dig in Dorset, southwest England.

(Bournemouth University via AP)</span></div>
<p>The results showed that two-thirds of the individuals descended from a single maternal lineage.</p>
<p>Lara Cassidy of Trinity College Dublin was one of the study's co-writers. Cassidy suggested to the Associated Press (AP) that the results were surprising, or in her words, “jaw-dropping.”</p>
<p>She said that such a finding had “never been observed before in European prehistory.”</p>
<p>The study appeared recently in the scientific publication <em>Nature.</em></p>
<p>The research suggests that women stayed in the same circles throughout life. They kept social networks and likely inherited or managed land and property.</p>
<p>Cassidy told the AP that the findings suggest, “it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood.”</p>
<p>Such a way of living is called matrilocality. The researchers said it is historically rare.</p>
<p>Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone is with the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Gnecchi-Ruscone was not part of the study.</p>
<p>He said researchers studying burial places in Britain and Europe have only discovered the opposite behavior. He said in those communities, women left their homes and families to join their husband's family group.</p>
<p>He said such a way of living, known as patrilocality, has been observed in other ancient time periods. These include the Neolithic period which started more than 10,000 years ago to the early Medieval period more than 1000 years in the past.</p>
<p>Cassidy said in studies of pre-industrial societies from around 220 years ago to the present, researchers found that men join their wives' extended family households only eight percent of the time.</p>
<p>But researchers already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A group of tribes with closely related languages and art that is often described as Celtic lived in England before the Roman invasion about 2000 years ago.</p>
<p>Valuable objects have been found buried with Celtic women. Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disrespect about their relative independence and fighting abilities.</p>
<p>The network of strong female family connections that the researchers found does not necessarily mean that women also held official positions of political power.</p>
<p>Study co-writer Miles Russell of Bournemouth University in England researches ancient societies. He said the findings do suggest that women had some control of land and property and strong social support. Such a situation made Britain's Celtic society more “egalitarian” than the Roman world, Russell said.</p>

<p>Facebook parent company Meta recently announced changes to the way it tries to identify misinformation and harmful material published on its social media services.</p>
<p>Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg <a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/">explained</a> in a video that the company had decided to make the changes because the old system had produced “too many mistakes and too much <strong>censorship</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Issues with Meta moderation</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - The Facebook logo is seen on a cell phone in Boston, USA, Friday, Oct. 14, 2022. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2ac5b816-9f18-48ba-9521-fb24fec5d49b_cx0_cy9_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - The Facebook logo is seen on a cell phone in Boston, USA, Friday, Oct. 14, 2022.

<p>Zuckerberg said the <strong>moderation</strong> system Meta had built needed to be “complex” to examine huge amounts of <strong>content</strong> in search of material that violated company policies.</p>
<p>However, he noted the problem with such systems is they can make a lot of errors. The Meta chief added about such systems, “Even if they accidentally censor just one percent of posts, that's millions of people.”</p>
<p>So, he said the company had decided to move to a new system centered on “reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression.”</p>
<p><strong>“Community Notes” system</strong></p>
<p>The new method turns over content moderation duties to a “Community Notes” system. The company said this system aims to “empower the community” to decide whether content is acceptable or needs further examination.</p>
<p>The changes will be effective for Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Threads services. Meta said the new system would become available first to U.S. users in the coming months.</p>
<p>Meta's former moderation system involved the use of independent, third-party fact-checking organizations. Many of these were large media companies or news agencies. The efforts included digital tools as well as human workers to fact-check content and identify false, <strong>inappropriate</strong> or harmful material.</p>
<p>Meta said the third-party moderation method ended up identifying too much information for fact-checking. After closer examination, a lot of content should have been considered “<strong>legitimate</strong> political speech and debate.”</p>
<p>Another problem, the company said, was that the decisions made by content moderators could be affected by their personal beliefs, <a class="wsw__a" name="_Int_6ywWHIXG">opinions</a> and <strong>biases</strong>. One result was that “a program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor.”</p>
<p>Meta's new Community Notes system is similar to the method used by the social media service X. A statement by Meta <a class="wsw__a" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/meta-more-speech-fewer-mistakes/">said</a> changes to this system will have to be made by users, not anyone from the company.</p>
<p>Meta said, “Just like they do on X, Community Notes will require agreement between people with a <strong>range</strong> of <strong>perspectives</strong> to help prevent biased ratings.” The company also invited any users to register to be among the first to try out the system.</p>
<p><strong>How did fact-checkers react to Meta's change?</strong></p>
<p>The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) criticized Meta's latest decision. It said the move threatened to "undo nearly a <strong>decade</strong> of progress."</p>
<p>The group rejected Zuckerberg's claim that the fact-checking program had become a "tool to censor" users. It noted, that "the freedom to say why something is not true is also free speech."</p>
<p>Milijana Roga<i></i>269; is executive editor of the Serbian fact-checking outlet Istinomer. She told Reuters news agency that she thinks Meta's decision would end up hurting the media industry. Roga<i></i>269; noted that research suggests that many citizens use Meta services as their main source for information. Removing independent fact-checkers “further <strong>hinders</strong> access to <strong>accurate</strong> information and news," Roga<i></i>269; said.</p>
<p><strong>How effective are Community Notes?</strong></p>
<p>Not a lot of research has been done on how effective Community Notes systems are. But one effort carried out by the University of California and Johns Hopkins University found in 2024 that community notes entered on X for COVID-19 misinformation were accurate. The research showed the notes used<strong> </strong>both moderate and high-quality sources and were attached to widely read posts.</p>
<p>However, the number of people taking part in that study was small. Also, the effects the system had on users' opinions and behavior is unknown.</p>
<p>A 2023 study, from the <em>Journal of Online Trust and Safety,</em> said it was harder for users to agree when they examined content related to political issues.</p>

            <title>Red Coloring Linked to Cancer Risk Banned in US Foods  (2025/1/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202501/red-coloring-linked-to-cancer-risk-banned-in-us-foods.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">22 January, 2025</span><br/>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned a chemical widely used to color some food products red. The ban of the coloring chemical, called dye, came nearly 35 years after it was removed from skin products because of a possible cancer risk.</p>
<p>A group of food safety and health supporters issued a <strong>petition</strong> in 2022 seeking to have the FDA ban Red No. 3 in food.</p>
<p>The earlier ban was ordered in 1990, after two studies showed Red No. 3 caused cancer in male rats eating high levels of the chemical. At the time, however, the FDA only acted to ban the coloring mixture in products put on the skin or in drugs taken by mouth.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This image shows a pile of candy corn in Westchester County, N.Y., Oct. 23, 2023. " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/180ce991-0d5d-4e08-bc3a-8f328f0a5d77_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This image shows a pile of candy corn in Westchester County, N.Y., Oct. 23, 2023. </span></div>
<p>Health activists had long sought FDA approval to expand the ban to food products. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red No. 3.</p>
<p>Some of the most common products containing Red No. 3 include sweets, icing, strawberry milk, maraschino cherries, strawberry protein drinks, as well as some gummy vitamins and medications.</p>
<p>The FDA said food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products.</p>
<p>Other countries still permit certain uses of the dye. But any imported products will still have to meet the new U.S. requirement. Red No. 3 is already banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, except in certain kinds of cherries.</p>
<p>The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027. And lawmakers in Tennessee, Arkansas and Indiana have also proposed limits on certain dyes, especially from foods offered in public schools.</p>
<p>Jim Jones is the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revoke-authorization-use-red-no-3-food-and-ingested-drugs">noted</a> that even though the agency had established the new ban, “the way that FD&amp;C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not <strong>occur</strong> in humans." FDA officials said the ban was enacted because of a U.S. rule called the Delaney Clause. This legal policy requires the FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Lurie is director of the <strong>consumer</strong> activist group the Center for Science in the Public Interest. He helped lead the latest effort to remove Red No. 3 from food products. Lurie told The Associated Press, "This is a welcome, but long <strong>overdue</strong>, action from the FDA.”</p>
<p>The International Association of Color Manufacturers has repeatedly said Red No. 3 is safe in levels usually taken in by humans. The group pointed to research carried out by scientific experts from the United Nations and the World Health Organization. One study, released in 2018, confirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.</p>
<p>Some food manufacturers have already changed their products to remove Red No. 3. One example is Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings. In its place, the company uses beet juice, a dye made from insects and other coloring mixtures.</p>

            <title>Make a Memory Palace to Improve Your English  (2025/1/22)</title>

<p>
Sherlock Holmes is an imaginary private detective created by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1880s. Doyle's stories about the detective have been turned into movies and television shows.</p>
<p>One of Sherlock Holmes' great skills is a powerful memory. In a recent BBC television series, the character uses a memory technique called a “mind <strong>palace</strong>” or “memory palace.”</p>
<p>On one show, for example, Holmes has been severely wounded in a shooting and retreats into his mind to search for ways to survive. He visits rooms in his mind palace, looking for helpful memories. In one room, he finds his childhood dog, and the memory helps calm the detective.</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/142EFFF5-F4C5-4CAE-A8C1-C76F629E3DD6_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>The memory palace idea was not a BBC creation. The method for remembering has existed for thousands of years. Many language educators today teach their students how to use the method to improve their language skills.</p>
<p>But what exactly is a memory palace? It is a real structure, such as a home or building, that you can picture in your head. You then imagine placing things you want to remember inside the structure.</p>
<p>You can use a memory palace to remember words, <strong>phrases</strong>, facts, or even the order of events. If you can see the inside of a house or building in your mind, you can make your own memory palace. On today's Education Tips, we will show you how.</p>
<p><strong>Making your palace</strong></p>
<p>Start with a list of words or phrases that you want to remember. Then, close your eyes and choose a physical space that you know well, such as your home, a school you attended, or a current or former workplace. If your chosen space has only one or two rooms, do not worry. You can also use things like doors, passageways, steps or other permanent places along the physical path.</p>
<p>The next step is to imagine walking through the space using the path that you would normally take through it. As you walk through, put objects that you want to remember at specific places along the path. Leave the objects there to pick up later when you visit your memory palace.</p>
<p>Now, let's try this technique by using six <strong>ingredients</strong> for a pizza: flour, water, dry yeast, tomato sauce, cheese and basil.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and picture a home.</p>
<p>First, you open the front door and see a bag of flour on the floor. The bag is broken and some of the flour has spilled. You are worried that you might <strong>slip</strong>, so you carefully step over the area.</p>
<p>Second, you walk into your bedroom. On top of your bed sits a cup of water. The cup is shaped like an upside-down piece of pizza. You think about how funny that is and laugh about it.</p>
<p>Third, as you enter the living room, you see a very large <strong>spoon</strong> of dry yeast sitting on the <strong>sofa</strong>. The spoon is watching a cooking show on television.</p>
<p>Fourth, while standing in the living room, you notice the room has a strange smell to it. You look above the television and see a block of cheese hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>Fifth, you walk into the <strong>kitchen</strong> and see two tomatoes chasing each other around the room. Suddenly, they crash and explode, covering the floor in red.</p>
<p>And sixth, you open the back door and go outside. There, you see a group of very tall green basil plants. In a funny voice, the tallest plant says, “Choose me! Choose me!”</p>
<p>Did you notice anything strange about the palace? It was full of extraordinary and humorous imagery. We will say more about that in a few minutes.</p>
<p>But first, let's check how well our technique worked. See if you can answer these questions:</p>
<p>1-What was on the wall above the television?</p>
<p>2-Where were the tomatoes and what were they doing?</p>
<p>3-Which object was sitting on the bed?</p>
<p>4-Where was the yeast and what was it doing?</p>
<p>5-Which ingredient spoke and what did it say?</p>
<p>6-What did you see when you opened the front door?</p>
<p>My <strong>guess</strong> is that you remembered everything in our memory palace. That's good news.</p>
<p><strong>Make memory strong</strong></p>
<p>Experts offer some advice for making strong memory palaces.</p>
<p>For instance, if you want to remember a lot of words, memory trainer Anthony Metivier suggests first <strong>drawing</strong> a simple map of your memory palace. Then, number the places along your path where you will put the things that you want to remember. You can put more than one thing in each room or area. Later, you will add the mental imagery.</p>
<p>English teacher James, of the YouTube channel JamesESL English Lessons, has additional advice. In his video on memory palaces, he says that there are three <strong>keys</strong> to a strong memory palace. They are: emotion, movement, and connections between the object and something permanent.</p>
<p>Both he and Metivier say imagining things in a humorous or crazy way improves your ability to remember them. These experts also agree that connecting images to actions or movement will create lasting memories. For instance, the tomatoes were chasing each other and the basil spoke.</p>
<p>And finally, teacher James suggests placing the objects next to or on something permanent in your palace. Beds, sofas, floors, walls, doors – all of these are permanent. The block of cheese was on the wall, for example.</p>
<p>Now, it's your turn. Pick a list of English words or phrases that you have trouble remembering and try this method on your own.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <title>Nepal Supreme Court Bans Large Business Development in Protected Areas  (2025/1/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Nepal's Supreme Court has struck down disputed laws that permit waterpower centers,<strong> </strong>visitor housing such as hotels, and other business development in protected natural areas. Environmental defenders say the January 15 ruling is a victory for efforts to protect the country's natural areas.</p>
<p>Nepal has recognized one fifth of its territory as protected natural areas. The country has 12 national parks and six conservation areas. They include lowland areas such as Chitwan National Park. The park is home to many wild animals such as tigers and rhinos. Other protected areas include Sagarmatha National Park, home to Mount Everest.</p>
<p>Waterpower, or hydropower, and <strong>tourism</strong> represent major economic sources for Nepal. Last year, its government passed laws to permit development of large projects in some parts of national parks, forests and other protected areas.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Nepalese mahouts walk their elephants through the Rapti River from Chitwan National Park in Sauraha, Chitwan, 170 kilometers (106 miles) south from Katmandu, Nepal, Monday, Dec. 26, 2011.

<p>Padam Bahadur Shrestha is a Nepalese environmental activist who took legal action against the laws. He told Agence France Press that the laws' passage showed that the government lacked <strong>insight</strong> and was only seeking to please business investors.</p>
<p>Shrestha praised the Supreme Court's ruling, saying it "<strong>preserves </strong>ecology and <strong>biodiversity</strong>.”</p>
<p>Nepal is recognized worldwide for its actions to protect its wild animal and plant life.</p>
<p>Nepal's environmental protection laws have helped the local tiger population increase from 121 animals in 2010 to 355 in 2023. And while only about 100 one-horned rhinos were living in Nepal in the 1960s, their number increased to 752 in 2021.</p>
<p>Nepal also increased its tree cover by almost 100 percent between 1992 and 2016. Wood industry activities, or logging, had deforested many areas of the country for tens of years earlier.</p>
<p>Rampreet Yadav is a former <strong>conservation</strong> officer of Chitwan National Park, Nepal's largest protected area. He said the recent laws “should never have been passed."</p>
<p>"If development projects are <strong>allowed</strong> in protected areas, they will destroy our nature and animal habitats," he added.</p>
<p>The Nepalese government wants to develop its hydropower industry, especially along rivers in the Himalayan mountains. Last October, it signed agreements with India and Bangladesh to export thousands of <strong>megawatts</strong> of hydropower.</p>
<p>Nepal also earns much money from tourism. Last year, around one million foreign visitors came to Nepal, and the government has been spending money on the development of its airports.</p>
