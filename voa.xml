        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Nations Agree to $300 Billion Deal at Climate Talks (2024/11/27)</title>

<p>Countries from around the world recently agreed to provide $300 billion to support poor nations in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>The agreement reached on November 24 at the United Nations climate talks in Azerbaijan left many unsatisfied. But some were hopeful that it would be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The final deal says that rich countries have agreed to collectively provide at least $300 billion a year by 2035. The amount is much smaller than the $1.3 trillion that developing nations were asking for and that experts said was needed.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Activists participate in a demonstration for climate finance at the COP29 U.N. Climate Summit, Friday, Nov. 22, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits)

</span></div>
<p>Chandni Raina is India's negotiator at the climate talks. She told The Associated Press that the amount of money in the deal was very small. She said, “I'm sorry to say we cannot accept it.”</p>
<p>Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, head of the National Council on Climate Change, called the deal an insult and a joke.</p>
<p>Ani Dasgupta is head of the environmental organization World Resources Institute. Dasgupta called it "an important down payment toward a safer, more <strong>equitable</strong> future." However, he added that the poorest countries are "rightfully disappointed” that wealthy nations did not offer more money with billions of lives at risk.</p>
<p>The meeting went on longer than expected because of serious divisions and strong disagreements among countries. But delegations who feel more hopeful about the agreement said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money will come in the future.</p>
<p>Eamon Ryan, Ireland's environment minister, called the agreement “a huge <strong>relief</strong>.” He said in a time of division and war, “the fact that we could get it through in these difficult <strong>circumstances</strong> is really important.”</p>
<p><strong>Final agreement at climate talks</strong></p>
<p>The final agreement includes a call for parties to work together using "all public and private sources" to get closer to the $1.3 trillion per year goal by 2035. That means also pushing for large international banks to help pay the bill. And it means, hopefully, that companies and private investors will follow by spending their money toward climate action.</p>
<p>The agreement also calls for developing countries that receive money to limit or cut the release of heat-trapping gases. Those targets are to be set early next year. They are part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015.</p>
<p>The money will pay for the move away from <strong>fossil fuels</strong> toward clean energy. It will go to countries hard hit by extreme weather to prepare for floods, storms and fires. It will also go toward improving a farming process to help them survive weather extremes. In areas hit regularly by severe storms, the money can help build stronger homes or help people move to safer places.</p>
<p>The Philippines, for example, has been hit by six major storms in less than a month. Millions of people faced strong winds, rising waters and serious damage to homes, roads and bridges and farmland.</p>
<p>Esther Penunia works with the Asian Farmers Association. She said many farmers had to deal with storm damage such as trees that will not produce fruit for months or years, or animals that died.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the Health &amp; Lifestyle report.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, Alberta, the sun had yet to come up. The temperature was more than 20 degrees below zero. In the dark and cold, Tanis Smith was ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.</p>
<p>And Smith was not alone. Ten people joined her for the activity. All were wearing several <strong>layers</strong> of clothing to keep warm.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this May 25, 2016 photo, members of the running group " and="" andrew="" down="" friendship="" fun="" group="" harnik="" in="" keep="" lincoln="" memorial="" moving.="" november="" of="" people="" photo="" project="" run="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6822190d-518b-4cd8-9775-efd50b696af8_w268_r1.jpg" stairs="" the="" to="" up="" uses="" washington.=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this May 25, 2016 photo, members of the running group "November Project" run up and down the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington.

<p>“You're pretty much just putting everything you own on,” said Smith, an accountant. “If you look at the pictures, you don't know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.”</p>
<p>Since that winter back in 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with a group called November Project.</p>
<p>November Project is a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston, Massachusetts. No matter the weather, members get out of bed before sunrise at least once a week and go outdoors for group exercise.</p>
<p>November Project is part exercise, part fun, and part community. It is a model for exercising outdoors, especially in the winter.</p>
<p>It started in 2011, when two friends agreed to exercise every morning for the month of November. They were looking for accountability and <strong>motivation</strong> to help them stick to an exercise <strong>routine</strong>.</p>
<p>By the end of that first month, they had invited others to join them. Soon, their meetings were bringing in almost forty people. And it became a year-round project.</p>
<p>“A party is better when there's more people around. We would talk to anybody who would listen,” said Bojan Mandaric. He created the project with friend, Brogan Graham.</p>
<p>Then, as people moved to other cities, they took the idea with them. So, the November Project grew. Now, there are 52 groups in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p><strong>What do the workouts look like?</strong></p>
<p>People of all ages and fitness levels join the workouts. Some groups begin with something called “The Bounce.” They <strong>chant</strong> and jump at the same time to bring the group together. Those who feel <strong>inhibited</strong>, do not have to do this.</p>
<p>Most classes include running and body weight exercises like <strong>squats</strong>. The project also uses the surroundings of the location. So, for example, some places include running up steps in an outdoor sports <strong>stadium</strong>. Currently in D.C., members meet on Wednesdays to run up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>To keep the workouts fun, they also might include fun games and activities from childhood. In Edmonton, they play snow games in winter and water games in summer. The games help to lower inhibitions. This helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw. He is co-leader of the Indianapolis, Indiana group.</p>
<p>“Nobody (is) cool at November Project,” he said.</p>
<p>Shaw said groups recognize members' <strong>milestones</strong>. People can earn prizes for reaching different goals.</p>
<p>To find out if a November Project group is near you, go to their website at <a class="wsw__a" href="https://november-project.com/np-experience/">November-Project.com</a>. Building community and making friends is another big part of the project. So, each group is active on social media.</p>
<p>If you do not have a November Project nearby, you can find another type of outdoor exercise group. Or start your own.</p>
<p>The November Project organizers offer a few suggestions on how to work out during colder months.</p>
<p><strong>Find workout friends</strong></p>
<p>Find workout friends. At the center of the project, is accountability. Members promise to show up. There is a sense of letting down your teammates if you do not show up, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row <strong>crew</strong> for Northeastern University. (Rowing crew is a type of boat racing.)</p>
<p><strong>Invest in some cold-weather clothing</strong></p>
<p>There is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, said Shaw, the leader from Indianapolis. He suggests wearing clothing next to your skin that removes <strong>sweat</strong>. This will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, he warned. It keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder.</p>
<p>Also, add a top layer that protects against bad weather. On its webpage, the November Project leaders for Washington, DC say workouts are not cancelled for weather.</p>
<p><strong>Make it a usual activity</strong></p>
<p>Promise yourself to exercise on the same days and times for a month. Create a routine. This will make it easier to stick to an exercise routine, says Mandaric.</p>
<p><strong>Make it fun</strong></p>
<p>And make sure to have fun. Exercise does not have to be hard or serious.</p>
<p>Smith, the member from Edmonton, Alberta, says she enjoys the social part of the November Project the most. She calls it “a chosen family.” They came together because they had fun exercising. She said. “You can have fun and get fit.”</p>
<p>And that's the Health &amp; Lifestyle report. I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Fossil from Germany Provides New Details about Ancient Flying Reptiles (2024/11/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Scientists say a <strong>fossil</strong> found in Germany is providing new details about flying reptiles that lived on Earth about 147 million years ago.</p>
<p>The fossil was discovered in 2015 in the southeastern German state of Bavaria. It contains the remains of a newly identified <strong>species</strong> called Skiphosoura bavarica.</p>
<p>Skiphosoura is considered a pterosaur, an ancient flying reptile. It lived toward the end of the Jurassic Period. Researchers say the creature played an important part in the development of <strong>ecosystems</strong> during the age of the dinosaurs.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A life restoration of two individuals of the newly identified Jurassic Period pterosaur species Skiphosoura bavarica are pictured in flight, in this illustration released on November 18, 2024.

(Gabriel Ugueto/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>The reptile had a wing reach of about 2 meters for traveling and a set of sharp teeth to help capture and eat other animals. Skiphosoura would have been one of the largest fliers in its ecosystem. Researchers say the discovered fossil was in good shape, with nearly every bone remaining in the skeleton. This has permitted the team to learn new details about this pterosaur.</p>
<p>One of the leaders of the fossil examinations is David Hone of Queen Mary University of London. He told Reuters news agency he thinks the fossil find was "of huge importance."</p>
<p>Hone was the lead writer of a <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)01377-0">study</a> describing the team's work in the publication <em>Current Biology</em>. He added that Skiphosoura has provided new information about the evolution of pterosaurs. "It also brings other pterosaur finds we had already made into <strong>focus</strong>,” Hone said.</p>
<p>He added that the discovery also helps better explain “where they go in the family tree of pterosaurs” and permits scientists to show this development from early to later forms.</p>
<p>"The teeth are quite long and sharp. They are for <strong>puncturing</strong> and holding," Hone said. He noted these were likely used to catch smaller animals such as lizards, small mammals, insects and possibly fish.</p>
<p>Pterosaurs are considered ancestors of the dinosaurs. They were the first of three groups of vertebrates – animals with a backbone – to enjoy powered flight. Pterosaurs disappeared about 66 million years ago in the mass <strong>extinction</strong> that also took out most of the dinosaurs after an <strong>asteroid</strong> struck Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists divide pterosaurs into two major groups - the early non-pterodactyloids and the later pterodactyloids. The early group's members had a short head, short neck, long tail and a long fifth toe on the foot. The later ones had a large head, long neck, short tail, long wrist and short fifth toe.</p>
<p>The team says the discovery of Skiphosoura – along with another species that lived 170 million years ago in Scotland – have helped shape important events in pterosaur development.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>New guidelines have been issued in the United States for preventing stroke – the nation's 4<sup>th</sup> biggest killer.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that in 2023, stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated half a million people suffer strokes in the U.S. each year. But the CDC notes that up to 80 percent of strokes could be prevented with better nutrition and exercise, along with improved risk identification.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A beach goer exercises as the sun rises above the Atlantic Ocean, Feb. 1, 2023, in Surfside, Fla.

<p><strong>What is a stroke?</strong></p>
<p>A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain breaks open, or bursts. The event keeps oxygen from getting to the brain. This can result in the person having difficulty thinking, talking and walking. In some cases, a stroke can even cause death.</p>
<p>Stroke is a major health problem across the world. On its website, the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.world-stroke.org/world-stroke-day-campaign/about-stroke/impact-of-stroke">World Stroke Organization</a> says the condition is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Over 100 million people worldwide have suffered a stroke. It is estimated that 25 percent of adults over 25 will have a stroke during their lifetime.</p>
<p>The new guidelines on stroke prevention came from the American Stroke Association. They are the first to be issued in 10 years. The advice includes suggestions for people and doctors and are based on improved information about who has strokes and why. The guidelines also include new drugs that can help reduce risk.</p>
<p>Health researchers say the best way to reduce the risk of stroke is the same as reducing risks for many other conditions. These include eating a healthy diet, moving the body often and not smoking.</p>
<p>Here is what to know about stroke and the newly issued guidelines:</p>
<p><strong>Eating healthy can reduce stroke risk</strong></p>
<p>Experts say eating healthy can help control possible stroke risks. The goal is to prevent or reduce high cholesterol, high blood sugar and obesity, the condition of being extremely overweight.</p>
<p>The advice urges people to choose foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil. Eating these foods can help keep cholesterol levels down.</p>
<p>Red meat should be limited, along with <strong>saturated fats</strong>. Additional protein can come from beans, nuts, poultry and seafood. Highly processed foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar should also be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Moving your body can help prevent strokes</strong></p>
<p>Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can greatly reduce a person's stroke risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell. She is a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Bushnell was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. She said regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk <strong>factor</strong> for stroke.</p>
<p>However, health experts say more movement is better. The stroke association suggests at least 150 minutes of moderate <strong>aerobic</strong> or 75 minutes of <strong>vigorous</strong> exercise activity every week. Such exercise could include going to the gym, taking a walk or running. People can also use exercise machines at home, dance or play a sport.</p>
<p><strong>New tools to reduce obesity, a risk factor for stroke</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines include a new group of drugs that have been proven to help people lose weight.</p>
<p>The drugs – designed for people with obesity or diabetes – had not been approved when past guidelines were issued. But the advice now suggests doctors consider these drugs for patients at risk for stroke. These include versions sold under the names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound,.</p>
<p>The new guidelines also help doctors identify people who might be at higher risk for stroke. For the first time, the advice suggests doctors <strong>screen</strong> patients for other risk factors. They could include gender or non-medical factors such as economic issues or the availability of quality health care.</p>
<p>The new guidelines also suggest that doctors screen for conditions that may increase a woman's risk for stroke. These could include high blood pressure during pregnancy or early <strong>menopause</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I'm having a stroke and what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Three of the most common stroke signs include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. Also, time is important when a person suffers a stroke. Brain damage can happen quickly, but it can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly.</p>
<p>Stroke experts have created an <strong>acronym</strong> to help people remember: FAST -- F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time.</p>
<p>If you think you or a loved one may be having a stroke, call the emergency response number in your area immediately.</p>

<p>A Scottish dairy, or milk cow farm, is offering what it calls Britain's costliest coffee: one cup for $344.</p>
<p>It is a huge price for a little cup of coffee, but the man selling it offers a deal sweetener: a share of a dairy farm.</p>
<p>For that price, they also receive 34 shares in Mossgiel Organic Dairy. The company offers the deal in a <strong>crowdfunding</strong> campaign it opened. It hopes to raise enough money to enlarge its <strong>sustainable</strong> operation and produce more milk.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated handout photo shows farmer and owner of Mossgiel Organic Farm Bryce Cunningham, right, giving a bottle of milk to barista Jacob Smith, as they pose outside The Good Coffee Cartel in Glasgow, Scotland.

<p>Investors who buy 34 shares get a <strong>certificate</strong> for a special coffee drink called a flat white. Holders can present their certificate and get their flat white at one of 13 coffee shops in Scotland that use the dairy's milk.</p>
<p>The dairy's owner, Bryce Cunningham, notes his coffee costs 80 times the usual price. "We know it sounds crazy, but when you break it down, it's a pretty good deal. How much is the future of farming worth,” he asked.</p>
<p>The price tops the $320 for a flat white at Shot London, a coffee bar in the wealthy Mayfair and Marylebone neighborhoods. That flat white was made with rare coffee beans from Okinawa, Japan. <em>The Telegraph</em> newspaper reported in April that it was the most costly coffee in Britain.</p>
<p>Cunningham is seeking about $375,000 from small investors in order to secure a much larger bank loan. He had already raised more than a third of his goal when he offered the flat white farm shares deal.</p>
<p>The loan he is seeking is worth more than $1.1 million. He says that financing will help him double operations and expand out of Scotland all the way to London.</p>
<p>Shareholders receive other rewards, too, such as farm visits, milk transport deals and invitations to special events. But investors are also given a <strong>standard</strong> warning that they could lose some or all of the money they invest.</p>
<p>The dairy farm in Mauchline, about 40 kilometers south of Glasgow, is historic. The famous 18th-century Scottish poet Robert Burns once worked at the farm. Burns, considered the national poet of Scotland, wrote while working in the fields there for two years. An image of his face is on each glass container of Mossgiel milk.</p>
<p>Todd Whiteford is an owner of The Good Coffee Cartel in Glasgow, that is serving the costly cups. He said the store has been using Mossgiel's milk for several years. He said other milk producers cannot meet the quality of Mossgiel's milk. He said it makes “rounder, smoother and sweeter” drinks.</p>
<p>“Theirs is the best. I'll argue with anyone about that,” Whiteford said.</p>

            <title>American Companies Develop Unmanned Aircraft for Crops (2024/11/25)</title>

<p>American companies are developing unmanned aircraft systems that are larger than <strong>drones</strong>. The goal is for the aircraft to help agricultural producers and reduce risks to human safety.</p>
<p><strong>Rotor technologies </strong></p>
<p>When Hector Xu was learning to pilot a <strong>helicopter</strong> in college, he remembered having a few bad experiences while flying at night.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Rotor Technologies unmanned semi-autonomous helicopter sprays a payload of water during a test flight over Intervale Airport, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, in Henniker, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a7f9bcb1-c664-4a2b-8cd7-0f144a5722a3_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A Rotor Technologies unmanned semi-autonomous helicopter sprays a payload of water during a test flight over Intervale Airport, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, in Henniker, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)</span></div>
<p>The experiences led him to research unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, Xu formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.</p>
<p>Rotor has built two <strong>autonomous</strong> helicopters that the company calls Sprayhawks. Rotor aims to have as many as 20 Sprayhawks ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would fly shipments into disaster areas and to oil rigs in oceans. The helicopters could also be used to fight wildfires.</p>
<p>For now, Rotor is paying attention to agriculture. The industry has accepted automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with <strong>pesticides </strong>and fertilizers.</p>
<p><strong>Safety </strong></p>
<p>A major appeal of automation in agriculture flights is safety.</p>
<p>Because special airplanes called <strong>crop dusters </strong>fly at around 240 kph and only about 3 meters off the ground, there are tens of accidents each year. The small planes hit power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older planes in disrepair and pilot tiredness play a part in accidents.</p>
<p>A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture flight accidents between 2001 and 2010, including 81 that were deadly. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 deaths.</p>
<p>“It is a very, very dangerous, profession,” said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. Martin said about the pilots, “They make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.”</p>
<p>Job risks also include possible contact with farming chemicals.</p>
<p>In recent years, safety and cost concerns have led to a number of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said.</p>
<p>He added that some 10,000 drones will likely be sold this year alone. “It's growing <strong>exponentially</strong> as a market, super fast,” Martin said.</p>
<p>But the size of the drones means they only can cover a small amount of the area that a plane or helicopter can. The limitation is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company, Pyka.</p>
<p>California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a buyer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received official approval last year to fly for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agrícola.</p>
<p>Lukas Koch is chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August. Koch has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming “revolution,” that will save farmers money and increase safety.</p>
<p>The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch does not see the unmanned aircraft replacing all the company's pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.</p>
<p>“The biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,” Koch said.</p>
<p>But Koch also says that autonomous aviation systems could bring new dangers to an already busy airspace. Still, the risk is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.</p>
<p><strong>The future </strong></p>
<p>Companies like Rotor have developed their systems to work if bad events come up.</p>
<p>Rotor's helicopter, for example, has a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.</p>
<p>If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system to deal with the problem. The system makes sure the engine can be turned off and the helicopter can perform a controlled landing.</p>
<p>The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be official government approval to fly its helicopters for business purposes. Once the company has approval, the difficulty, as Xu sees it, will be building more devices to meet the demand in the United States and Brazil.</p>

            <title>NASA Reconnects with Voyager, Longest Serving Mission in History (2024/11/25)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>NASA has once again reconnected with its Voyager spacecraft, marking a continuation of the American space agency's longest mission in history.</p>
<p>The two spacecraft – Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 – launched within weeks of each other in 1977. So they have been operating for more than 47 years.</p>
<p>NASA officials have reported several difficulties with the spacecraft in recent years, mainly communication issues. The most recent problems involved the Voyager 1 spacecraft. NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-1-resumes-sending-engineering-updates-to-earth/">said</a> in a statement in April it had remained out of touch with the spacecraft for the previous five months.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, or the space between stars, which it entered in 2012. (Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0aff-0242-521b-08dbfbd5ea87_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This artist's concept shows NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft traveling through interstellar space, or the space between stars, which it entered in 2012. (Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)</span></div>
<p>Agency officials said they later learned the problem was linked to a <strong>chip</strong> inside one of Voyager 1's onboard computers. The issue made data being sent by the spacecraft unreadable. NASA said its engineers were able to fix that problem by making changes to how the spacecraft stores and reads data.</p>
<p>Then, in October, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/10/28/after-pause-nasas-voyager-1-communicating-with-mission-team/">reported</a> another communication issue that resulted in a brief delay in receiving data from Voyager 1. That problem turned out to be linked to the spacecraft's radio transmitter system.</p>
<p>The agency said that, for some reason, Voyager 1's <strong>fault</strong> protection system was activated when NASA sent a command for the spacecraft to turn on one of its heaters. This activation – meant to save power – led Voyager 1 to start sending signals to a different radio <strong>transmitter</strong> system than it normally uses.</p>
<p>This meant NASA had to listen for the signals on the S-band instead of the usual X-band. Once they did this, they were able to start receiving data again. NASA has said the S-band is much weaker than the X-band, so engineers were seeking to get the X-band radio communication system back online for long-term use.</p>
<p>NASA said the agency had not used the S-band since 1981.</p>
<p>Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are NASA's most distant operating spacecraft. The agency has reported Voyager 1 is exploring space from about 24 billion kilometers from Earth, while Voyager 2 is operating from about 20.5 billion kilometers away.</p>
<p>Because of this great distance, NASA says its communication with the two Voyagers takes about one day to receive data, and another day to send information back from Earth.</p>
<p>The two Voyagers were first designed to explore Jupiter and Saturn. Both spacecraft successfully carried out studies of those planets. Later, Voyager 2 made the first-ever close observations of Uranus and Neptune in 1989.</p>
<p>The two spacecraft then began a new mission to explore distant areas of space. In 2013, NASA announced Voyager 1 had crossed over the border dividing our solar system from interstellar space. The term “interstellar” means “between stars.” Scientists say interstellar space begins where the sun's continuous flow of particles and its magnetic field stop.</p>
<p>Voyager 2 first entered interstellar space in 2018. NASA said the spacecraft was more than 17.7 billion kilometers from the sun at the time. Both Voyagers are the only spacecraft so far to explore interstellar space.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>The space agency says the Voyagers are studying how the interstellar medium interacts with the solar wind. Solar wind is the continuous flow of charged particles released by the sun. The spacecraft have also provided data on the heliosphere, a kind of protective <strong>bubble</strong> around our solar system.</p>
<p>Suzanne Dodd is the current project manager for the Voyager mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. She recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/missions/voyager-program/still-kickin-since-the-70s-nasas-voyager-mission-keeps-exploring/">said</a> in a statement the agency has no plans to retire the two Voyagers as long as they are communicating with mission members back on Earth. Dodd said the spacecraft are currently centered on observing how interstellar space and the heliosphere interact with each other.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't be doing Voyager if it wasn't taking science data," she added. Dodd noted one reason the Voyagers have been operating for so long is that the engineers who built them provided multiple backup systems to avoid future problems.</p>
<p>She said some who worked on Voyager in its earliest days have even come back from retirement to pass on knowledge to the next generation of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>"From where I sit as a project manager, it's really very exciting to see young engineers be excited to work on Voyager,” Dodd said. “To take on the <strong>challenges</strong> of an old mission and to work side by side with some of the <strong>masters</strong>, the people that built the spacecraft – they want to learn from each other."</p>

            <title>Fossil Found in Brazil Shows Birds’ Brain Development (2024/11/25)</title>

<p>The brains of today's birds show a level of intelligence and behavioral complexity <strong>rivaled</strong> only by<strong> mammals</strong>. But scientists do not fully understand how bird brains have changed over millions of years from the form they had as dinosaurs. That understanding is now growing thanks to a <strong>fossil</strong> discovery in Brazil.</p>
<p>Researchers unearthed the remains, or fossil, of a head bone, or skull, of a bird <strong>species</strong> not known before. It has been named Navaornis hestiae. The fossil was in such good condition that scientists were able to create a computer image of its brain and inner ear structures. It lived in a dry area about 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, near the end of the age of dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>One of a kind</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Photo of Navaornis hestiae fossil from report by Luis M.

(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08114-4#rightslink)</span></div>
<p>"This finding is one-of-a-kind," said University of Cambridge fossil expert Guillermo Navalón, a lead researcher of the study. It appeared this month in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://rdcu.be/d0IAO"><em>Nature</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Birds developed from small, feathered dinosaurs during the Jurassic Period. The Navaornis discovery filled in a 70-million-year <strong>gap </strong>in the understanding of the development of the bird, dating back to the earliest-known bird Archaeopteryx. It lived about 150 million years ago in what is now Europe.</p>
<p>The researchers said the Navaornis skull has a bill and eye shape like modern birds. Its brain shows both modern and ancient elements, and some that are in between.</p>
<p><strong>Well-preserved example</strong></p>
<p>Luis Chiappe is a fossil scientist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in California and a co-writer of the study.</p>
<p>He said scientists rarely find such skulls of early birds, “and this one is the best <strong>preserved</strong> ever."</p>
<p>Daniel Field is a fossil scientist at the University of Cambridge and the study's lead writer. He said scientists have long struggled to understand how and when the brains and intelligence of birds developed. “The field has been awaiting the discovery of a fossil exactly like this one," he said.</p>
<p>The Navaornis brain - measuring about 10 millimeters across - is smaller, relative to skull size, than that of modern birds. But the skull is larger and more complex than that of Archaeopteryx.</p>
<p>Its cerebellum, a brain structure that in living birds helps with motor control during flight, was smaller than in today's bird species and more like Archaeopteryx's. But its brain was connected to the spinal cord in a way similar to modern birds, as well as humans. It was unlike Archaeopteryx and the dinosaurs from which birds evolved.</p>
<p>Navaornis also had something special – its inner ear organ for balance is larger than in any other known bird.</p>
<p>The fossil included 80 percent of the bird's bone structure, or skeleton. The scientists say they believe the bird could fly well based on their examination of the remains.</p>
<p>Its name means "Nava's bird," named for William Nava, the scientist who discovered the fossil in 2016 in the southeastern Brazilian state of Sao Paulo.</p>
<p><strong>No direct line to today's birds</strong></p>
<p>Navaornis lived during the Cretaceous period, but none of these birds survived the <strong>asteroid</strong> strike that took place 66 million years ago. That means there is no direct line from Navaornis to today's birds, and its modern-looking abilities and appearance developed separately from theirs.</p>
<p>The researchers said the bird ate insects and seeds it could take in whole. It lived side-by-side with huge, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs and large meat-eating dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Field said if you gave it a quick look you might think it was like a living bird. But a closer look would show you some important differences – like <strong>claws</strong> coming out of its wings.</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about the term “rub.” While this three-letter word is small, it should not be seen as unimportant. In fact, "rub" carries a lot of meaning and can be used in many different situations.</p>
<p>For starters, "rub" is a noun.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Boston Red Sox third baseman Rafael Devers gets an elbow bump from the batboy (right) after hitting a two-run home run at Tropicana Field, Sept. 10, 2020, St. Petersburg, Florida. (Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/054e991e-0780-41c9-9bc7-ec67c96d5132_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Boston Red Sox third baseman Rafael Devers gets an elbow bump from the batboy (right) after hitting a two-run home run at Tropicana Field, Sept. 10, 2020, St. Petersburg, Florida. (Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports)</span></div>
<p>One way it is used this way is in cooking. A rub is a collection of dry seasonings that can be added to meat, tofu or vegetables before cooking.</p>
<p>"Rub" can also mean something problematic. If I ask, "<u>What's the rub</u>?" I am asking “What's the problem?” (This expression is very <strong>informal</strong>.)</p>
<p>“Rub” is also a verb.</p>
<p>For example, I might rub my head if I have a headache. Or I may rub my shoulder if it hurts. And if something really hurts, I might rub in some medicine to help reduce the pain.</p>
<p>But <u>to rub something in</u> also has another meaning – an <strong>idiomatic </strong>one. If you <u>rub something in</u>, you keep reminding someone of something unpleasant. This is a very common expression. So, let's hear it used in a conversation.</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, I had fun playing basketball yesterday. Your team almost won. Almost. </em></p>
<p><em>B: It was fun. I got a great workout. </em></p>
<p><em>A: What was the score again?</em></p>
<p><em>B: Okay, okay. Stop <u>rubbing it in!</u> Your team beat mine by ... a lot!</em></p>
<p><u>Rubbing something in</u> is similar to <u>rubbing someone's nose in something</u>. In the example we just heard, one man rubs his friend's nose in a loss at a basketball game. When we rub someone's nose in something, we remind them that they have failed or got something wrong.</p>
<p>As a verb, “rub” is used in many other expressions.</p>
<p>If you <u>rub someone the wrong way</u>, you cause that person to be angry or annoyed. It means you have <strong>irritated</strong> them, usually for something in your <strong>personality</strong> or behavior. You do not have to do anything specific to <u>rub someone the wrong way</u>. For example, the president of the company <u>rubbed some of his employees the wrong way</u> with his direct way of speaking.</p>
<p>Another expression is <u>to rub elbows with someone.</u> We use this expression to describe being at the same event as someone or simply being around them. But we don't generally use it for interactions with our close friends. Often, the people we <u>rub elbows</u> with are famous, important, or influential. For example, I <u>rubbed elbows</u> with some famous people at the mayor's birthday celebration.</p>
<p>Another way to use the verb “rub” is in the expression <u>to rub salt in the wound</u>. This means you make a bad situation worse for someone else. Let's say you know someone who loses their job. When they tell you that news, you remind them that they still owe you money. You have just <u>rubbed salt in the wound</u>. Ouch! This is similar to <u>kicking someone when they are down</u>.</p>
<p>Another use of the word “rub” is in the phrasal verb <u>rub together</u>. We use this with other words to say that we lack something. For example, if I <u>don't have two brain cells to rub together</u>, I can't think straight. I'm <strong>confused</strong>. Or, if you <u>don't have two dimes to rub together</u>, you have no money. You are <strong>broke</strong>! (You could also say pennies or quarters -- as long as they are coins.)</p>
<p>Our last expression is <u>to rub something out</u>. That means you get rid of it. And sometimes we use it in a rather violent situation. If a bad person <u>rubs someone out</u>, they do away with them. In other words, they actually kill them!</p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>!</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Baby Hippo in Thailand Gets Official Song for Worldwide Fans (2024/11/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/baby-hippo-in-thailand-gets-official-song-for-worldwide-fans.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">22 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>A baby hippopotamus in Thailand became famous earlier this year when zoo workers published images and videos of her online. Now the pygmy hippo, named Moo Deng, has an official song and video released in several languages for her fans worldwide.</p>
<p>Moo Deng lives at Khao Kheow Open Zoo, southeast of the Thai capital, Bangkok. Zoo worker Atthapon Nundee has been posting sweet moments of the animal's life for the past few months.</p>
<p>During that time, the hippo has received widespread attention on social media. Fans of the animal have expressed how they enjoy watching the pink-cheeked baby actively interact with her mother and other zoo workers.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Two-month-old baby hippo Moo Deng walks at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chonburi province, Thailand, Sept. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f3e16e95-3879-43b1-92f5-c9065e5496b6_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Two-month-old baby hippo Moo Deng walks at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chonburi province, Thailand, Sept. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit, File)</span></div>
<p>Moo Deng – which means “<strong>bouncy</strong> pork” in Thai – is a kind of meatball. The name, chosen by fans on social media, is similar to those of her two <strong>siblings</strong>: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). In addition, the zoo has a common hippo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg).</p>
<p>Moo Deng's popularity has spread internationally and she has gained the attention of some professional sports teams. Fans say her name fits her lively <strong>personality</strong>. Moo Deng likes to “deng,” or bounce, and her bouncing behavior has led to countless internet <strong>memes</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the German soccer team FC Bayern, American basketball team Phoenix Suns and the American football team Washington Commanders have all created Moo Deng memes. The images give her interesting things to wear and put her in different human-like situations.</p>
<p>Atthapon, the zoo worker, told The Associated Press he was surprised the newborn pygmy hippo quickly became such a huge internet star. “I wanted people to know her,” he explained. “I wanted a lot of people to visit her, or watch her online, or leave fun comments. I never would've thought (of this),” he added.</p>
<p>The widespread publicity led a well-known Thai composer to write and produce a special song for Moo Deng. The lively, 50-second song is called, naturally, <em>Moodeng</em>. One of Thailand's biggest recording companies, GMM Music, released the song.</p>
<p>A music video that goes along with the song shows the baby hippo bouncing around, playing with her keeper or spending time with her mother, Jona.</p>
<span class="c-sticky-element__close-el c-sticky-element__swipe-el ta-c" title="close">
<span class="ico ico-close m-0"></span>
</span>
<p>Moo Deng is now four months old. She has also been drawing big crowds at the zoo. Officials estimated the baby hippo has brought in about 3,000 to 5,000 visitors a day on average during the past few months. The zoo has been selling clothes, bedding and other products based on Moo Deng.</p>
<p>The zoo's director is Narongwit Chodchoi. He told the AP that the additional earnings from Moo Deng will help the zoo's <strong>breeding</strong> programs for many endangered animals, like the pygmy hippopotamus. Illegal hunting and loss of <strong>habitat</strong> threatens the animal's existence. Pygmy hippos are native to West Africa. But experts say there are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild.</p>
<p>All four versions of the Moo Deng song are available on YouTube and on streaming services including Spotify and Apple Music.</p>

            <title>Learning Prepositions (2024/11/23)</title>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Kelvin in Ghana about the usage of prepositions in English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/47edc4e2-745b-439f-a1c9-24dda264089d_w268_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>Please, I would like to know more about prepositions.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Kelvin</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Kelvin.</p>
<p>Prepositions are those small words that give additional information about nouns, such as direction, time, location, and possession.</p>
<p>We can put prepositions into two large groups. In the first group, prepositions tell us about direction, location, time, and relations between people or things. These details are what people first learn when they study prepositions in English. Just a few examples of location and time include:</p>
<p><em><u>on</u> the table.</em></p>
<p><em><u>under</u></em><em> the table.</em></p>
<p><em><u>by</u> nine <u>in the</u> morning.</em></p>
<p><em><u>at</u></em><em> night.</em></p>
<p>Some examples that show relations between people include:</p>
<p><em>A friend <u>of</u> mine.</em></p>
<p><em>I worked <u>with</u> him. </em></p>
<p><em>I did it <u>for</u> you.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prepositions in common expressions</strong></p>
<p>The second large group includes common expressions where the preposition sometimes has a less exact meaning. That is why knowing which preposition to use with these expressions becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Consider the following two examples. The first is used in British English, the second in American English:</p>
<p><em>This house is <u>different to</u> the one I used to live in.</em></p>
<p><em>This house is <u>different from</u> the one I used to live in. </em></p>
<p>The two examples mean the same thing. And there is no clear reason why we should use one preposition instead of the other.</p>
<p>Here is another expression where we use one preposition instead of another. We often say:</p>
<p><em>The news took me <u>by</u> surprise.</em></p>
<p>But we never say:</p>
<p><em>The news took me <u>with</u> surprise.</em></p>
<p>However, notice that changing the preposition “by” to the preposition “with” does not appear to change the meaning of this expression.</p>
<p>To someone learning English, one preposition might seem as good a choice as any other for this expression. That is why it is easy to make mistakes and sometimes difficult to remember the correct preposition to use.</p>
<p>So, how can you remember what preposition to use with such expressions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not try to learn the expression separately from the preposition, and then go back and put the preposition in your memory.</li>
<li>Instead, try to hear and remember the entire expression as one phrase instead of several words.</li>
<li>Just as we put numbers into groups of three or four to remember phone numbers, try to think of an expression and its preposition together as one group.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our readers and listeners, what are your questions about American English? We'd like to hear from you. Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="21voa.com">21voa.com</a>. And please include where you are from in your email, too.</p>
<p>And that's <em>Ask a Teacher</em>.</p>

            <title>‘A Great Situation:’ Canadian Town Lives with Polar Bears (2024/11/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Churchill, Manitoba is a small, rural Canadian town that lives with neighboring <strong>predators </strong>and loves it. That is because the predators — a polar bear population — attract the visitors who saved the town's economy after a military base there closed. <strong>Tourists</strong> wanting to see the bears bring millions of dollars into the local economy.</p>
<p class="summary">However, the bears are entering the town more often in search of food. Researchers say the sea ice where the bears normally hunt is shrinking.</p>
<p>Geoff York is with Polar Bears International, a nonprofit environmental group based in Manitoba. York said: “You're seeing more bears because there are more bears on the land for longer periods of time to be seen” and they are willing to take more risks, getting closer to people.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A polar bear stands near rocks, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in Churchill, Manitoba. (AP Photo/Joshua A. Bickel)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/6f419059-a387-44fe-8237-101fdde25f0f_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A polar bear stands near rocks, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in Churchill, Manitoba.

<p>There are about 600 polar bears in this Western Hudson Bay population. Environmentalists say that is about half what it was 40 years ago. Humans in Churchill outnumber the bears although not by very many.</p>
<p class="summary">It has been more than 10 years since a polar bear attacked anyone in Churchill. But townspeople look out for each other and tourists with a warning system and guards. There is even a polar bear jail.</p>
<p class="summary"><strong>Controlling Churchill's bears</strong></p>
<p>Sergeant Ian Van Nest is a Manitoba province conservation officer. He recently guarded the streets of Churchill in his truck. It was the beginning of polar bear season in Churchill.</p>
<p class="summary">The vehicle is equipped with a rifle and a <strong>barred</strong> back seat to hold anyone he might have to arrest.</p>
<p class="summary">Van Nest saw a crowd of people who were watching a bear. He looked around for trouble in the area and then quietly spoke to the group's leader.</p>
<p>“How are you today?” Van Nest asked. The group leader answered that they were all right and then asked if their gathering place is acceptable to Van Nest.</p>
<p>“You're good,” the officer answered. “You [have] got a lot of distance there,” he added. So, the tour group continued to watch a polar bear on some nearby rocks.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of visitors</strong></p>
<p>Visitors interested in seeing the polar bears saved Churchill from shrinking out of existence when a military base there closed in the 1970s. The closure led to a drop in Churchill's population, from a few thousand <strong>residents</strong> to about 870.</p>
<p>A 2011 government study found that the average polar bear tourist spent about $5,000 per visit. The tourism adds more than $7 million yearly to the economy of the little town. Churchill has a few nice restaurants and more than 25 places where visitors can stay.</p>
<p>“We're...used to bears so (when you see one) you don't start to <strong>tremble</strong>,” Mayor Mike Spence said. “It's their area too. It's important how the community coexists with bears and wildlife in general to really get along. We're all connected.”</p>
<p>Churchill residents show polar bear <strong>pride</strong> in a way that mixes terror and fun.</p>
<p>“You know we're the polar bear capital of the world, right? We have the product, it's just about getting out there to see the bears safely,” said Dave Daley, who owns a gift shop, runs <strong>dog sleds</strong> and <strong>promotes</strong> the city. He also is a former president of the Chamber of Commerce, an office that supports business activity.</p>
<p>The former military base had a rocket launch area. It seemed to keep bears away. When it closed, the bears started entering the town more often, longtime residents said. So, Churchill and province officials “put together a polar bear alert program to make sure the community members were looked after, [and] protected,” said Spence who has been Churchill's mayor since 1995.</p>
<p>The town's old curfew <strong>siren</strong> sounds nightly, warning people that it is time to go inside to be safe from bears.</p>
<p>Georgina Berg recalls growing up in the 1970s near Churchill, where many First Nations people lived. “First Nations” is used in Canada to identify native people.</p>
<p>She remembers how differently her father and mother would react to seeing a bear in the past. She said her father would not pay attention to them.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘If you don't <strong>bother</strong> them, then they won't bother you,'" she recalled.</p>
<p>When a bear came near in later years, after her father had died, her mom was frightened.</p>
<p>“Everybody was yelling, and all the kids had to come in and everybody had to go home. And then we stayed silent in the house for a long time until we knew for sure that bear was gone,” Berg recalled.</p>
<p>For Van Nest, the provincial officer, the recent meeting with a group of bear watchers was different. The group was about 100 meters away from the bear. He said the bear was “putting on a bit of a show” for the tourists.</p>
<p>“This is a great situation to be in," he said. “The tourists are a safe distance away and the bear's doing his natural thing and not being <strong>harassed</strong> by anybody.”</p>

<p>Many medical experts say that walking is an easy way to improve physical and mental health, support fitness and prevent disease. They advise that walking is a great first step toward a healthy life although other forms of exercise are also important.</p>
<p><strong>Good effects of walking</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Sarah Eby is a sports medicine physician with Mass General Brigham in the state of Massachusetts. Eby said walking has many good effects and people do not need extra things. “You don't need equipment and you don't need a <strong>gym</strong> membership,” Eby noted “And the benefits are so <strong>vast</strong>.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A member of the Get Healthy Walking Club walks past the rhinoceros exhibit in the morning at the Louisville Zoo in Louisville, Ky., Friday, Oct. 18, 2024.

<p>The U.S. surgeon general, a federal health officer, recommends that adults get at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week.</p>
<p>Walking helps meet that goal. Exercise lowers the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>Walking also helps blood sugar levels, is good for bone health, and can help people lose weight and sleep better. That is what Julie Schmied said. She is a health care worker with Norton Healthcare in Kentucky, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.</p>
<p>Walking is also a relatively low-<strong>impact</strong> exercise that puts less pressure on joints than other exercises while strengthening the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>James Blankenship is 68 years old. He said joining a walking club at the Louisville Zoo last year helped him recover after a heart attack and a complex triple-bypass heart operation in 2022.</p>
<p>“My cardiologist says I'm doing great,” he said.</p>
<p>Some say walking is not enough. Anita Gust teaches exercise science at the University of Minnesota Crookston. Gust said walking “is not enough for overall health and well-being” because it does not provide resistance training that builds muscle strength and <strong>endurance</strong>.</p>
<p>Some health experts say that is especially important for healthy bone development in women as they age.</p>
<p>Experts recommend adding other activities at least twice weekly. These could include using weights, gym equipment or one's own body for resistance exercises. Training that improves <strong>flexibility,</strong> like yoga or stretching, can also be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>How much should you walk?</strong></p>
<p>Many people have heard about the walking goal of 10,000 steps a day. This advice dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But, experts note that this is only a guideline.</p>
<p>Shmied said the average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day, and it is fine to increase that number to 10,000.</p>
<p>Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests dividing the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During rainy or snowy weather, people can walk in malls or on <strong>treadmills</strong>.</p>
<p>As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up or walk up hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.</p>
<p>“If you can talk but not sing,” Eby said, “that's what we consider moderate-intensity exercise.”</p>
<p><strong>Staying with your walking program</strong></p>
<p>Walking with friends, including dogs, is one way to keep walking.</p>
<p>Walking clubs have appeared across the nation. In 2022, 31-year-old personal trainer Brianna Joye Kohn started City Girls Who Walk with a TikTok post inviting others to walk with her in New York.</p>
<p>“We had 250 girls show up,” she said.</p>
<p>Since then, the group has walked every Sunday for around 40 minutes, with some meeting afterward for a meal or coffee.</p>
<p>The Louisville Zoo launched its walking club in 1987. It joined with Norton Healthcare in 2004 to expand it and now has more than 15,000 registered members. Every day from March 1 through October 31, people walk around and around the zoo before it officially opens.</p>
<p>Recently, Janet Rapp walked down a path through the city zoo, waving at friends and stopping briefly to greet big flightless birds called emus that she knows by name.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old retiree starts each morning this way with a walking club.</p>
<p>“I'm obsessed,” she said. Not only does it ease her joint pain, “it just gives me energy...And then it calms me, too.”</p>

<p>A much-publicized art piece made up of a single banana taped to a wall has sold for $6.2 million.</p>
<p>The sale happened Wednesday night during an <strong>auction</strong> in New York City at famous art seller Sotheby's. The work, called <strong><em>Comedian</em></strong>, was sold to cryptocurrency businessman Justin Sun. He is a Chinese collector and founder of the cryptocurrency company Tron. Sun placed the winning bid over the phone and the sale was completed in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Before the auction, Sotheby's said the unusual art piece was expected to bring in at least $1.5 million. But the price quickly started rising after the auction began, with people <strong>bidding</strong> inside the auction room, as well as on the phone and online.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, a woman looks at artist Maurizio Cattelan's piece of art " alvarez="" an="" at="" auction="" comedian="" during="" eduardo="" file="" in="" monday="" munoz="" new="" nov.="" photo="" preview="" sotheby="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/773557b8-b82e-4d13-9293-23d2e3492663_cx0_cy10_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" york=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, a woman looks at artist Maurizio Cattelan's piece of art "Comedian" during an auction preview at Sotheby's in New York, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024.

<p>The art piece had already sold three times for prices between $120,000 and $150,000, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>Sun said in a statement after the auction that <em>Comedian</em> "is not just an artwork." He added that the piece "bridges the worlds of art, <strong>memes</strong>, and the cryptocurrency community.”</p>
<p>Sun said he planned to eat the banana, as at least two onlookers did when the artwork was presented at places around the world. Sotheby's says the fruit was always meant to be replaced repeatedly, along with the <strong>duct tape</strong>.</p>
<p>The work was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It was first presented in 2019 at the Art Basel Miami Beach show in Miami, Florida. The piece quickly led to much public discussion about what should be considered art.</p>
<p><em>Comedian</em> belongs to a kind of art known as conceptual artwork. A conceptual piece is one in which the idea or meaning behind the work is more important than the finished object itself.</p>
<p>The head of contemporary art at Sotheby's is David Galperin. He told the AP he understands the piece's popularity because it is highly provocative. Provocative describes something likely to produce a strong reaction and much public debate.</p>
<p>“What Cattelan is really doing is turning a <strong>mirror</strong> to the contemporary art world,” Galperin said. He added that he thinks <em>Comedian</em> can cause people to question what values should be attached to artworks and what can be defined as artwork.</p>
<p>“What you buy when you buy Cattelan's <em>Comedian</em> is not the banana itself, but a <strong>certificate of authenticity</strong>,”<strong> </strong>Galperin said. That document, he added, gives the owner permission to reproduce the banana and duct tape on their own wall as an <strong>original </strong>artwork by the artist.</p>
<p>The sale of <em>Comedian</em> came shortly after Sotheby's auctioned off a famed artwork in the <em>Water Lilies</em> series by French painter Claude Monet. That piece sold on Monday for $65.5 million.</p>
<p>When asked to compare Cattelan's simple wall art to major works like Monet's, Galperin said that form of art, called impressionism, was not taken seriously when that movement first began.</p>
<p>“No important, <strong>profound</strong>, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,” Galperin said.</p>

            <title>Thanksgiving and English Grammar (2024/11/22)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/thanksgiving-and-english-grammar.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">21 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Every year around the Thanksgiving holiday, a strange ceremony happens in Washington, DC. The president stands outside the White House, gives a brief speech and then officially pardons a turkey.</p>
<p>A pardon is a declaration that someone will not be punished.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself, "What is the connection between turkeys, Thanksgiving and grammar?"</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="everyday grammar - thanksgiving and stative verbs " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/13C7BB45-AAD5-4C6C-B105-CF27EF766749_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">everyday grammar - thanksgiving and stative verbs </span></div>
<p>In today's report, we explore what turkeys can teach you about English verbs.</p>
<p>In particular, we will show you how Thanksgiving can teach you to use<strong> stative</strong> verbs. We will also show you the difference between stative and <strong>progressive</strong> verbs.</p>
<p><strong>What is a stative verb?</strong></p>
<p>The term stative verb refers to a verb that has a stative meaning. In other words, these verbs show or describe conditions or situations that do not do anything but exist.</p>
<p>Verbs that commonly have a stative meaning include:</p>
<p>-verbs that show emotional states, such as love and <strong>dislike</strong>;</p>
<p>-verbs that describe sense perceptions, such as smell or taste;</p>
<p>-verbs that show existence, such as seem or look.</p>
<p>In the present tense, a verb with a stative meaning is generally used in its simple form. "I love turkey," or "Americans like turkey" are two examples.</p>
<p>Verbs that have stative meanings are generally not used in the progressive tense. So, you will probably not hear a native speaker say, "I am loving turkey," or "Americans are liking turkey."</p>
<p><strong>Thanksgiving and stative verbs</strong></p>
<p>Do not fear: we can use our Thanksgiving example to make the point clearer.</p>
<p>Imagine you are at an American store. You hear a conversation between a customer and a store employee. The customer wants to buy a turkey that weighs 10 pounds, or 4.5 kilograms.</p>
<p>Unlike the turkey from the pardoning ceremony, this turkey will have a sad fate: the dinner table.</p>
<p>The conversation you hear might go like this:</p>
<p><em>Customer: How much does that turkey weigh?</em></p>
<p><em>Butcher: It weighs 10 pounds.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: How much does it cost?</em></p>
<p><em>Butcher: It costs 20 dollars.</em></p>
<p>In the dialogue, you can hear two examples of stative verbs: weigh and cost.</p>
<p>The butcher said, "The turkey weighs 10 pounds,” and "The turkey costs 20 dollars." In both cases, the verbs have a stative meaning: The butcher is describing a condition or situation that simply exists – the weight and cost of the turkey.</p>
<p>Now imagine you are eating Thanksgiving dinner with an American family. You might hear any one of the following sentences:</p>
<p><em>"I love turkey!"</em></p>
<p><em>"I dislike turkey."</em></p>
<p><em>"The turkey smells wonderful!"</em></p>
<p><em>"The food tastes great!"</em></p>
<p><em>"The turkey seems undercooked."</em></p>
<p><em>"The turkey looks awful."</em></p>
<p>All these sentences include stative verbs. You might notice that the verbs are also in the simple present form.</p>
<p><strong>Why not use a progressive verb?</strong></p>
<p>So, why would an English speaker not say, "The turkey is seeming undercooked," or, "I am disliking turkey?"</p>
<p>Susan Conrad and Douglas Biber are two English grammar experts. They say that, in general, English speakers use the progressive tense only when the subject of the verb actively controls the state or action.</p>
<p>In addition, English speakers generally use the progressive only when the verb describes an action or state that happens over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>So, you would not hear an English speaker say, "The turkey is seeming undercooked" because the subject of the verb, the turkey, does not control its state – being undercooked.</p>
<p>For the same reason, you would not hear an English speaker say, "I am disliking turkey," because the verb's subject, <em>I</em>, probably does not have control over the action of disliking turkey.</p>
<p>Now, some verbs can have stative and progressive meanings.</p>
<p>Consider these examples:</p>
<p><em>"The food tastes good."</em></p>
<p><em>"The president is tasting the food."</em></p>
<p>In the first sentence, the food does not control whether it is good or bad. As a result, the verb <em>taste </em>has a stative meaning because it simply describes the condition of the food.</p>
<p>In the second sentence, "The president is tasting the food," the subject of the verb, <em>the president</em>, has control over his action.</p>
<p>In addition, the action takes place over an extended period of time: the president must think about tasting food, then raise the food to his mouth, then consider its quality. So, you could say that the verb taste in this example has a progressive meaning.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p>
<p>The next time you are reading or listening to the news, pay special attention to the verbs.</p>
<p>Notice when the progressive form is used, and when the simple form is used. Then ask yourself why. Does the verb's subject control the action? Does the action occur over an extended period of time? Or does the verb simply describe a condition that exists?</p>
<p>If you are still confused about whether you should use a simple or progressive verb in your own conversations, Conrad and Biber have one tip that might help you.</p>
<p>They say that in conversations, English speakers use simple verbs around 120 times in every 1,000 words.</p>
<p>Progressive verbs are much less common: they appear fewer than 20 times in every 1,000 words.*</p>

            <title>Social Media Service Bluesky Adds Millions of Users Since US Election (2024/11/21)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/social-media-service-bluesky-adds-millions-of-users-since-us-election.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">20 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The social media service Bluesky says it has been gaining millions of users since the U.S. presidential election. Usage data shows Bluesky reached 20 million users this week. That was up from about 12 million users just one month ago.</p>
<p>Bluesky is seen as a major competitor to social networking service X, formerly Twitter. American businessman Elon Musk bought Twitter in October 2022 and changed the name to X.</p>
<p>Musk made a series of changes to X shortly after taking over. These included greatly reducing the number of employees, as well as removing some existing restrictions on user content. Many of the released workers were responsible for <strong>monitoring</strong> the service to identify banned material or account violations.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, the app for Bluesky is shown on a mobile phone, left, and on a laptop screen on June 2, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3eee3676-9e80-4845-af2d-984d492bc198_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">In this file photo, the app for Bluesky is shown on a mobile phone, left, and on a laptop screen on June 2, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)</span></div>
<p>Musk has described the changes as an effort to protect the free speech of users. But his critics have noted that removing content restrictions had resulted in more harmful content and hate speech appearing on X.</p>
<p>Some industry experts also see the recent rise in Bluesky users as a possible reaction to the changes under Musk's leadership at X.</p>
<p><strong>What is Bluesky?</strong></p>
<p>Bluesky was started by the former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. He created it in 2019 as an internal project at Twitter. It started as an invitation only service, or platform. But after further development efforts, it was opened up to all users last February.</p>
<p>Bluesky operates similarly to X and Twitter. It offers a feed of accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and lock certain posts at the top of a user's feed. Bluesky also offers pre-chosen “starter packs” to help new users decide which individuals and organizations to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Bluesky growing?</strong></p>
<p>Bluesky announced in mid-November that its total users had reached 15 million from 13 million at the end of October. The rate of new users has continued to grow during the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But the latest post-election increase was not the first time Bluesky has gained from people leaving X. In the week after X was banned in Brazil in August, Bluesky said it added about 2.6 million users – 85 percent of them from Brazil. And during one day in October, about 500,000 new users signed up for Bluesky after X warned that blocked accounts would be able to see a user's public messages.</p>
<p>Many new users – including reporters, left-leaning politicians and <strong>celebrities</strong> – have shared messages or created <strong>memes</strong> to explain their decisions for leaving X for Bluesky. Some expressed that they saw Bluesky as similar to an early version of Twitter.</p>
<p>Several well-known organizations and individuals recently announced they were leaving X because of concerns about changes to that service. These included the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, British news publisher <em>The Guardian</em> and former CNN news presenter Don Lemon.</p>
<p>Even with Bluesky's growth, X issued a statement after the U.S. presidential election saying it had “<strong>dominated</strong> the global <strong>conversation</strong> on the U.S. election”<strong> </strong>and had set new records.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond social networking</strong></p>
<p>Even though Bluesky currently operates much like X, company leaders have said they plan to expand in new directions, The Associated Press reports. For example, Bluesky says it is seeking to build a new technical foundation it describes as “a <strong>protocol </strong>for public conversation.”</p>
<p>That system is designed to make social networks work across different platforms such as email, internet blogs or phone numbers. Currently, users cannot cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone's account. X users must stay on X, TikTok users must stay on TikTok, etc.</p>
<p>Industry experts say this design is what big technology companies wanted – to build out multiple product offerings around their online properties. Such systems support the advertising-driven business models of tech companies.</p>
<p>Bluesky has said it is trying to reimagine this kind of system on its path toward “<strong>interoperability</strong>” with other platforms.</p>

            <title>Sake Makers Hope for UNESCO Listing (2024/11/21)</title>

<p>The Japanese rice wine called sake is made using ancient <strong>brewing</strong> methods. They date back more than a thousand years.</p>
<p>Junichiro Ozawa, the 18th-generation leader of Ozawa Brewery, founded in 1702, hopes sake-brewing will win recognition as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Officials of the UN agency are expected to decide on the nomination next month.</p>
<p>“We always think about the people who're enjoying our sake when we make it. I'm now so excited, imagining the faces of all the people around the world,” he told reporters during a visit to the brewery on the edge of Tokyo.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Traditional containers to keep Japanese sake are placed for decorations at a room shown during a media tour at the Ozawa Sake Brewery in Ome, on the western outskirts of Tokyo, Japan, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024.

<p>Sake was the drink of choice of the nobility represented in Japan's most celebrated work of writing, The Tale of Genji. Sake has been growing in popularity in recent years, helped by an increasing international interest in Japanese cooking and food.</p>
<p>Sake exports from Japan total more than $265 million a year, with the U.S. and China as the two biggest buyers. That information comes from the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association.</p>
<p>Sake exports have almost doubled in value since 2018. But exports still make up a very small amount of overall sake production in Japan. Brazil, Mexico and Southeast Asia, as well as France and the rest of Europe, all places where Japanese restaurants are gaining popularity, are starting to take a liking to sake.</p>
<p>The main elements in sake are rice and water. The production process takes about two months and includes <strong>fermentation</strong> and pressing.</p>
<p>For a product to be named Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese. The relatively soft quality of freshwater in Japan, like that provided by the two wells at Ozawa Brewery, is also important.</p>
<p>Among Ozawa's sake choices is the Junmai Daiginjo, one of the top offerings, with 15 percent alcohol content and costing about $23 for 720 milliliters.</p>
<p>Another, Karakuti Nigorizake, is unrefined sake. The liquid is not as clear as usual sake. It has 17 percent alcohol content and sells for $16 for 1,800 milliliters.</p>
<p>In Japan, sake is used to purify and to celebrate. Small tastes of sake from a cup show the confirmation of a marriage, for example.</p>
<p>“Sake is not just an alcoholic<strong> beverage</strong>. It is Japanese culture itself,” said Hitoshi Utsunomiya of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association.</p>
<p>The UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage<strong> designation</strong> can be awarded to <strong>practices</strong> passed down for generations. These practices include spoken traditions, performing arts, and food making.</p>
<p>The UNESCO designation is not meant to be used for commercial purposes. But industry officials are open about their hope that such recognition will increase international sales. They believe the designation could help the tradition stay alive amid competition from beer, grape-based wine and other drinks.</p>
<p>One reason for sake's growing popularity around the world is that its smooth flavor goes well with a number of foods. These foods include sushi, spicy Asian and Western dishes, says Max Del Vita, a sake wine expert and co-founder of The Sake Company, an import and distribution business in Singapore.</p>
<p>Del Vita told The Associated Press. “Sake is more than a drink. It is a living embodiment of Japan's seasonal rhythms, community values and artistic heritage.”</p>

<p>People will no longer have to fight with m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s in the historic Thai city of Lopburi.</p>
<p>That is because of new efforts to keep the animals from reproducing and to limit their movements.</p>
<p><strong>M<i><i>onkey</i></i> City</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A long-tailed macaque takes food from a local student near Phra Prang Sam Yot temple, in Lopburi, Thailand, June 7, 2024.

( REUTERS/Chalinee Thirasupa)</span></div>
<p>Before public health measures to control COVID-19 closed businesses in Lopburi, about 3,000 long-tailed macaques lived there. The people of the city fed them and even had a yearly party for them. Tourists came to the city north of Bangkok to see the macaques in what was known as "M<i><i>onkey</i></i> City."</p>
<p>The macaques are believed to bring good luck. They live in the nearby forests and have long been a part of the city's history. But after Lopburi came out of the pandemic lockdown in the middle of 2022, people found that the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s had become unruly without people feeding them.</p>
<p>Groups of macaques had taken over buildings. They stole food and caused accidents by walking in the streets. Groups of the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s also fought each other, shocking local people. Some of the townspeople put up <strong>cages</strong> around their homes to keep the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s out.</p>
<p><strong>Stealing food</strong></p>
<p>Wisarut Somngam is a local researcher with the non-governmental organization, Ecoexist Society. He said the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s would steal from people by taking any container they thought might contain food. People began to carry slingshots, a small weapon that shoots stones, to protect against the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, officials began their efforts to catch the macaques. By May, they were increasing the effort to prevent the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s from reproducing that began during the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to <strong>neuter</strong> all the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s, 100 percent of them," said local veterinarian Patarapol Maneeorn from the government wildlife department in September. The m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s would then be put into an area where they will be looked after, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Capture of m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s</strong></p>
<p>Now, the situation in the city seems to be under control, as the officials have captured 1,600 of the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s. Some animal rights groups agree the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s should be neutered, but they do not want them to be kept in captivity.</p>
<p>Edwin Wiek is founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand. He said, “The m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s are suffering because currently they're in a cage that is not designed for them.” Wiek pressed the government to increase funding for the government wildlife department to train people in animal care and treatment.</p>
<p>The people of Lopburi are happy that the streets are safe again. Clock maker Chalit Nithiwkram said, "Things have become a little easier because most of the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s were captured. Life is easier." He said his business is improving because people are no longer afraid to park near his shop.</p>
<p>For others, the m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s are important to Lopburi. Supaporn Reanprayoorn operates a store near a temple where m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s often gathered. "M<i><i>onkey</i></i>s are part of Lopburi's identity," she said. She sometimes gave them a little food. "Let tourists take pictures with them - just a hundred or two," she joked.</p>

            <title>Can Bees, Dogs Identify Cancer Earlier Than Machines? (2024/11/20)</title>

<p>Researchers at Michigan State University recently found that bees' sense of “smell” is sensitive enough to identify chemical smells of cancer.</p>
<p>Bees sense chemicals in their environment using antennae, structures on their heads, which serve as “noses” to sense smells.</p>
<p>The researchers wrote in a study published last month that honeybees can <strong>sniff out</strong> lung cancer on a patient's breath.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A honeybee in the harness, with blue wax holding the bee in place, as an odor line is placed in front of the bees' antennae.

</span></div>
<p>Debajit Saha is an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Michigan State University. He was part of a team that published the research.</p>
<p>“Our world is <strong>visual</strong>. [The] insects' world is all based on smell, so their sense of smell is very, very good,” Saha said.</p>
<p>“There is quite a bit of research that shows that when some cancer grows inside our body, our breath actually changes. Our research does show that honeybees can <strong>detect</strong> lung cancer and possibly other diseases based on the smell of those cells.”</p>
<p>Saha and his team placed bees in small <strong>harnesses</strong> and attached small wires to their brains. The insects were then placed near chemicals that are like the breath of a person with lung cancer.</p>
<p>The scientists said that the bees could tell the difference between the cancer breath and the laboratory copy of the healthy human breath 93 percent of the time. The scientists added that the bees could also tell the difference between different kinds of lung cancer.</p>
<p>The discovery could help doctors detect many cancers, including lung, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers, earlier than other methods. Saha says detecting cancers this way would be an improvement. “The reason is, many times we detect the cancer late,” when a growth has become too big to control easily. But, he added, when cancer starts growing the breath starts changing much earlier.</p>
<p>He hopes to develop a system that a patient will be able to breathe into and which can be carried around easily. This would deliver test results immediately.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, within the next five years, we'll have something to show that humans can be <strong>diagnosed</strong> using these insect brain disc sensors,” Saha said.</p>
<p><strong>Dogs can also help find cancer</strong></p>
<p>Using animals to detect cancer is not a new idea. At the Penn Vet Working Dog Center at the University of Pennsylvania, researchers are training dogs to smell some kinds of cancer.</p>
<p>Cindy Otto is executive director of the Penn Vet Working Dog Center in Philadelphia. She said many other animals also have very good senses of smell. “But part of what makes dogs so good is that they cooperate with humans, and so, they communicate that information,” she added.</p>
<p>The dogs are in a program where they live with families and are brought to “work” each day. Not all dogs can do this work. Otto said,</p>
<p>“They need to love it to be <strong>engaged</strong>. And so, it's a really fun game for them.”</p>
<p>Some researchers say that dogs detect cancer better than machines. They note that a dog's sense of smell is 10,000 to 100,000 times sharper than that of humans.</p>
<p>Amritha Mallikarjun is another postdoctoral researcher at the center. She said dogs are more sensitive to smells than any machines sold today. But the scientists hope to create a machine that will identify disease just as well as dogs.</p>
<p>Otto said doctors in ancient Greece and Rome used odor as a tool to identify disease. She hopes the researchers can build on that “and <strong>advance</strong> the health of not only humans, but dogs and other species as well.”</p>

            <title>College Degree Remains Big Prize for Many Student-athletes (2024/11/20)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Name, image, and likeness, or NIL, deals have enabled student-athletes to make money while going to college in the United States. But outside of some big-name athletes, many say that a degree remains the biggest, most important prize for going to school.</p>
<p>For years, college athletes could only receive free education and living costs while competing for school teams. But that changed in 2021 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that athletes could earn money by selling their name, image and likeness.</p>
<p>Well-known athletes like Jayden Daniels, now with the Washington Commanders, and Caitlin Clark, who currently plays for the Indiana Fever, made large amounts of money while in college.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Northern Arizona University's Jonny Bottorff poses for a photo on campus on Monday, Oct. 28, 2024, in Flagstaff, Ariz. (AP Photo/Josh Biggs)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8008216e-fe19-4bbf-9ab6-66fab0487a32_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Northern Arizona University's Jonny Bottorff poses for a photo on campus on Monday, Oct. 28, 2024, in Flagstaff, Ariz. (AP Photo/Josh Biggs)</span></div>
<p>But several athletes told The Associated Press that the money available to them through NIL remains a small consideration compared with earning a degree and competing in the sports they love.</p>
<p>NIL deals were not on Jonny Bottorff's mind when he <strong>transferred </strong>to Northern Arizona University on a football <strong>scholarship</strong> from a small college in Missouri.</p>
<p>Bottorff said, “I think the reality for most college athletes is things haven't really changed that much. We just got an extra little bit of <strong>cash</strong> in our pockets...”</p>
<p>For some athletes, NIL money is a reason to stay longer in college. But Anthony Leal said he is staying at Indiana University for a different reason.</p>
<p>Leal plays for Indiana's basketball team. Under college athletic rules, he can play four seasons for the team within five years. Leal already received his undergraduate degree<strong> </strong>last year. But he is coming back as a fifth-year student to get a master's in business administration.</p>
<p>“I'm about 70 percent through the program in the Kelley School of Business,” he said. “I wanted to get that degree.”</p>
<p><strong>Another rule change </strong></p>
<p>Another change in college rules also makes it easy for athletes to transfer and play the next season. Under previous rules, athletes had to sit out a year before competing.</p>
<p>Now, the top athletes can enter what is called a transfer portal to get more NIL money at another school and compete right away. University of Nevada, Las Vegas football player Matthew Sluka, for one, recently left the team in a dispute over an NIL payment. His representative said he was promised payment but never received it.</p>
<p>But Ray Harrison said NIL money was not the reason why he left Presbyterian College and joined the basketball team at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>Harrison said, “I just came out here because this is where God led my heart. Of course, we win two (conference) championships and that changes things.”</p>
<p>A college education remains a dream for many younger athletes.</p>
<p>Tavarius Covington from Chicago wants to continue to play football in college. He hopes that football will help him become the first in his family to go to college and earn a business degree. He also wants to be an example for his younger brother.</p>
<p>“I want him to know there is more to look forward to coming out of high school,” Covington said.</p>

            <title>Artists in Lebanon Keep Creating During Conflict (2024/11/20)</title>

<p>Charbel Samuel Aoun is a working artist in the Middle Eastern nation of Lebanon. As the Israeli military launches a deadly attack against the militant group Hezbollah in his home country, Aoun asks, "Does art still have a place in such a crisis?"</p>
<p>Lebanon has long played an important part in the Arab world's artistic community. It has been a center for arts, music and theater, combining traditional and modern influences.</p>
<p>Now, Lebanese artists are using their work as a way to express the anger and loss they feel after a year-long Israeli offensive that has killed more than 3,200 people, most of them since September.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Displaced and refugee children attend an event where Lebanese singer Joy Fayad and musician Oliver Maalouf perform, amid the ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces, in Dbayeh, Lebanon November 9, 2024.

(REUTERS/Emilie Madi)</span></div>
<p>Aoun's works of art are directly connected to the conflicts Lebanon has seen. In 2013, he began gathering dust from Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon to create a series of paintings before moving on to explore other materials.</p>
<p>Now, he says the darkness and hopelessness of the war and the waste left behind by Israel's intense bombing campaign have renewed his desire to create art from dust.</p>
<p>"You either stop everything or keep going with the little that still has meaning," he said.</p>
<p>Two of his <strong>exhibitions</strong> have been canceled due to the war. While he once made money from selling art, he now also relies on selling honey from his <strong>beehives</strong>, which he first set up as a project to create art from <strong>beeswax</strong>.</p>
<p>"I can no longer rely on the art market," he said.</p>
<p><strong>No demand for art</strong></p>
<p>Exhibition spaces across Beirut have closed in recent months. Their owners told Reuters there is no demand to buy art at this time. Even Lebanon's famous Sursock Museum has stored its collections underground.</p>
<p>Lebanese singer and musician Joy Fayad has also struggled with the emotional cost of the conflict. It has made it difficult for her to perform for months.</p>
<p>"It limited my creativity; it was like I <strong>shut down</strong>. I couldn't give to others, nor to myself," Fayad, 36, said.</p>
<p>Instead, she threw her energy into songwriting. One line in a new song reads: "You are from the <strong>downtrodden</strong> people, whose word has been silenced, and by their weapons, you are paying the price with your blood."</p>
<p>She recently began performing again, singing for displaced and refugee children in Lebanon at an event north of Beirut.</p>
<p>"They're changing the atmosphere, having fun after such a difficult period," she said, especially for those who became used to the sound of bombs instead of music.</p>

<p>Imagine a wheelchair equipped with wheels <strong>flexible</strong> enough to move over all kinds of barriers: including the raised edges of streets.</p>
<p>A robotic delivery vehicle could use the same wheels to go up <strong>stairs</strong> to deliver food or other purchases.</p>
<p>This is what researchers from the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM) see as the future for their <strong>'morphing'</strong> wheel. The wheels can change their shape and can roll over barriers up to 1.3 times their radius. The radius of a wheel is half its height.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials researcher controls a wheelchair with stiffness-variable morphing wheels as it goes over an obstacle in Daejeon, South Korea November 5, 2024.

(Reuters TV/via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>Other possible applications for the morphing wheel include robots that gather information about an enemy in the battlefield.</p>
<p>The KIMM team also hopes that morphing wheels will one day be used with two and four-legged robots. Now, the movement of those machines is limited. Too much <strong>shaking</strong> is also a problem. With the morphing wheels, the robots could carry objects that need smooth movement for industrial use.</p>
<p><strong>Aim to increase speed</strong></p>
<p>Song Sung-hyuk is the lead researcher at South Korea's KIMM and a member of the AI robotics research team. He said the goal is to make the wheels work at the average speed of a car. That is about 100 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>Wheels developed for a similar purpose, such as airless wheels, have flexibility but are limited in their ability to overcome barriers, said Song. The difference between airless wheels and the morphing wheel is that airless wheels are always soft, but the morphing wheels can change from hard to soft when they meet a barrier. They can then return to being hard to permit faster travel where there are no barriers.</p>
<p>The morphing wheel is made of an outer circle of <strong>chain</strong> and a series of wires running through its central hub. A sensor controls the <strong>stiffness</strong> of the wires in reaction to the barriers in its path.</p>
<p>Song's team demonstrated to Reuters a model of a wheelchair riding on morphing wheels as it climbed stairs with 18-cm steps. The team has also tested a device using the wheel at speeds of up to 30 kilometers an hour.</p>

<p>Scientists say they were able to identify signs that Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano might <strong>erupt</strong> about two months before it exploded.</p>
<p>A new study explains the signs they discovered and how their method might be used to predict future eruptions.</p>
<p>Mauna Loa is the world's largest active volcano. The volcano's most recent eruption began in November 2022. In the weeks before the eruption, scientists identified, or detected, small earthquakes nearby. They also recognized other signs of volcanic activity and were able to warn people on the island of Hawaii.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, onlookers watch the lava flow down the mountain from the Mauna Loa eruption, Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022, near Hilo, Hawaii.

(AP Photo/Marco Garcia, File)</span></div>
<p>Now, examinations of lava from the volcano have confirmed when melted rock underground started to move.</p>
<p>Kendra Lynn is a research geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory who helped lead the research. She also co-wrote the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52881-7">study</a>, which recently appeared in the publication <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>Lynn told the Associated Press that ground expansion and increased earthquake activity near the volcano resulted from melted <strong>magma</strong> rising from lower levels of Earth's <strong>crust</strong>. This movement of liquefied rock filled openings beneath the volcano.</p>
<p>When the underground pressure got high enough, the magma broke through hard surface rock and became lava. Later, the researchers collected pieces of the volcanic rock.</p>
<p>The team studied the chemistry of certain <strong>crystals</strong> within the lava to estimate when major movements began. It found that around 70 days before Mauna Loa's eruption, large amounts of melted rock had moved from three to five kilometers underground to just two kilometers beneath the surface. The researchers said this movement matched the timeline the geologists had observed with other signs.</p>
<p>Before 2022, the last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. Most of the U.S. volcanoes scientists consider to be active are found in Hawaii, Alaska and near the West Coast. Worldwide, about 585 volcanoes are considered active.</p>
<p>“Volcanoes are <strong>tricky </strong>because we don't get to watch directly what's happening inside – we have to look for other signs," said Erik Klemetti Gonzalez. He is a volcano expert at Denison University in Ohio who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>Ben Andrews heads a volcano program for the U. S. government's Smithsonian Institution. He also was not involved in the study. Andrews told the AP that scientists are still not able to fully predict volcanic eruptions. But he said they can issue a “<strong>forecast</strong>” based on observations and data.</p>
<p>Andrews compared volcano forecasts to weather forecasts, which are based on the probability that an event might happen. Experts say better data about past volcanic behavior can help researchers produce more detailed forecasts of future activity.</p>
<p>Klemetti Gonzalez added, “We can look for similar <strong>patterns</strong> in the future and expect that there's a higher probability of conditions for an eruption happening.”</p>

<p>Are you dreaming of a vacation to a warm place next to the sea?</p>
<p>You may be thinking of sitting under a palm tree, or next to a banana plant. Or you may dream of walking on a faraway island in the <strong>tropics</strong> surrounded by colorful flowers such as birds of paradise and cannas.</p>
<p>Tropical plants make us feel like we are in warm places with a pleasing climate. In cold climates, these plants can grow outside during the summer. But they suffer in cold weather.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This 2006 image provided by Chris Petersen shows an orange canna plant in bloom at Landcraft Environmentals in Mattituck, N.Y.

(Chris Petersen via AP)</span></div>
<p>The gardening expert for the Associated Press, Jessica Damiano, says most people in the United States have to treat tropical plants like annuals because they do not survive cold winters. An annual plant is one that dies after one growing season.</p>
<p>Following her guidelines you will find out how to save both tropical plants and money. You also can make future summers at home feel like an <strong>exotic</strong> getaway.</p>
<p><strong>Colocasia</strong></p>
<p>If you bought <strong>potted</strong> elephant ear plants, also called Colocasia, cannas or caladiums, bring the pots inside instead of putting them into the waste collection. Place them near a sunny window, water often and fertilize as directed with ordinary houseplant fertilizer at half strength.</p>
<p>If the plants are too big for the house or have been planted in the garden, leave them outdoors until the first <strong>frost</strong> turns their leaves brown. Then cut the plants down to 15 centimeters tall and dig them up.</p>
<p>Rinse and separate their roots, which might have small, rounded parts, and let them dry completely. Then prepare a box with some air holes and peat moss to store the roots. Place the box or container in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>Examine them once a month, adding water if they seem to be drying out, and throw out any rotten pieces. Plant outdoors and fertilize when the soil has warmed up to 16 degrees Celsius in spring. You also can start them indoors in potting mix one month earlier. Set them by your sunniest window or under grow lights, keeping the soil a little wet.</p>
<p><strong>Potted hibiscus and angel trumpets</strong></p>
<p>Gardeners should also bring potted hibiscus and angel trumpets, also known as Brugmansia, indoors before the first frost. Treat them as houseplants by placing them next to a sunny window during winter. These plants may lose their leaves, but they will come back in the spring.</p>
<p>If there is no room for the plants in your living space, you can help them get through winter by storing pots at six to seven degrees Celsius. Examine them twice a month and water them very lightly when the soil feels dry at finger depth.</p>
<p>Before moving them outdoors, place the plants in a warm, sunny spot. Lightly <strong>prune </strong>them, water and fertilize the plants about one month before it is safe to move them back outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Banana plants</strong></p>
<p>Potted banana plants should be cut down to soil level when the first frost browns their leaves. Store the containers in a dark place at roughly six to seven degrees Celsius. Look at the soil monthly, watering very lightly only when completely dry. Growth will begin again in spring but keep the plants indoors until the danger of frost has passed. Fertilize and resume regular watering.</p>
<p>Do not cut back bananas that are growing in the ground in the fall. Just dig them up and contain their roots in a plastic waste bag. Store them as you would a potted banana plant. Cut them down to 15 centimeters in spring and plant them in the garden after the danger of frost has passed.</p>
<p>Then, put the money you would have spent on new plants toward a water container, a firepit or tropical fruit juice. You can then sit back and enjoy your tropical backyard <strong>oasis</strong>.</p>

            <title>Study: Chinese Rover Finds Evidence of Ancient Ocean on Mars (2024/11/18)</title>

<p>Scientists say newly examined data from a Chinese explorer on Mars adds to existing evidence that the planet once had a very large ocean.</p>
<p>The exploring vehicle, or rover, is called Zhurong. It landed on the Martian surface in 2021. The rover has been operating in an area known as Utopia Planitia. This area is a large <strong>plain</strong> in Mars' northern hemisphere, the American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia03796-utopia-planitia/">explains</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers combined data from Zhurong's instruments with observations from satellites and spacecraft orbiting Mars. The team said the examinations appeared to show that Utopia Planitia had geological elements suggesting an ancient ocean coastline.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="In this file photo, a screen broadcasts a CCTV state media news update, showing an image of Mars taken by Chinese Mars rover Zhurong as part of the Tianwen-1 mission, in Beijing, China, May 19, 2021.

<p>The scientists said multiple elements, or features, pointed to evidence that a large ocean existed on Mars billions of years ago. The discovered surface features included <strong>troughs</strong> and <strong>channels</strong> that may have been formed by flowing water on Mars.</p>
<p>Earlier research that examined data of similar surface features suggested they might have been created by mud volcanoes, which likely formed in areas where there had been water or ice.</p>
<p>The researchers said the evidence suggests the area likely contained deep ocean environments as well as <strong>shallow</strong> ones. The research findings were recently reported <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75507-w">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>
<p>Bo Wu was the lead writer of the study. He is a planetary scientist at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Wu told Reuters news agency, "We estimate the flooding of the Utopia Planitia on Mars was approximately 3.68 billion years ago. The ocean surface was likely frozen in a geologically short period."</p>
<p>The search for water on Mars is closely linked to the search for signs of possible life. Evidence of a past ocean raises the possibility that the planet may have once supported microbial life.</p>
<p>There have been past studies suggesting Mars once had a large northern ocean. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/new-evidence-for-large-ancient-ocean-on-mars/6818883.html">One such study</a> was released in 2022. That research was based on satellite images of the Martian surface. The images were combined to produce detailed maps of the planet's northern hemisphere. Examination of the maps led to evidence of coastlines that once sat at the edge of a large ocean.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/new-study-suggests-mars-has-large-underground-ocean/7744218.html">Another study</a>, released in August, presented evidence suggesting Mars may contain a large ocean deep beneath its surface. That evidence was based on NASA's InSight Lander.</p>
<p>China's Zhurong rover began its data collection mission in May 2021. It stopped operating about one year later, with mission planners saying the power system was likely affected by sand and dust. But the rover still outlasted its planned mission of three months.</p>
<p>The researchers said the data shows that the ocean seems to have disappeared by about 3.42 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The study suggests the water that likely filled the Martian ocean was “heavily silted,” study co-writer Sergey Krasilnikov said. He is a planetary scientist at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Silt is a mix of sand and clay that has been carried by water, but later settles on land.</p>
<p>Krasilnikov added that during the period when the Martian ocean would have been active, the planet “...probably had a thick, warm atmosphere.” At that time, “microbial life was much more likely," he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Polytechnic's Wu said the new findings do “provide further evidence to support the theory of a Martian ocean.”</p>
<p>However, he told the French news agency AFP the study does "not claim that our findings <strong>definitively</strong> prove” there was an ocean on Mars. Such proof, he said, would likely require a future mission to bring Mars materials back to Earth for closer study.</p>

            <title>Ethiopia Finds Limited Success in Moving to Electric Vehicles (2024/11/18)</title>
            <pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/ethiopia-finds-limited-success-in-moving-to-electric-vehicles.mp3"/>

<p>As the price of fuel increased greatly in Ethiopia earlier this year, Awgachew Seleshi decided to buy an electric vehicle, or EV. The decision follows government efforts to slowly remove gas-powered vehicles from the roads.</p>
<p>Months later, Seleshi is not sure whether it was the right decision. He now faces an uneven supply of electricity and a lack of parts for repair. He told the Associated Press that imported parts from China are costly and, “few <strong>mechanics</strong> are able to fix such cars and the <strong>resale</strong> value of such cars is poor."</p>
<p>Seleshi's problems are like those of many in Ethiopia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A driver charges his electric car at a charging station in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. (AP Photo)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/354c49eb-6b91-4ed2-9eb9-735419b0c137_cx0_cy3_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A driver charges his electric car at a charging station in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024. (AP Photo)</span></div>
<p><strong>Ban on non-electric private vehicles</strong></p>
<p>In January, the East African country became the first in the world to ban imports of non-electric private vehicles. The decision eased pressure on the government's use of limited foreign <strong>currency</strong> to lower the cost of fuel.</p>
<p>In early October, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8 percent as part of a plan to slowly end fuel <strong>subsidies</strong> in Africa's second-most populous country.</p>
<p>Officials say more than 100,000 electric cars are imported into the country each month. And the government hopes to increase that number by 2030. By that time, the country's new dam on the Nile River is expected to produce electricity at full power.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said earlier this year that the Grand Renaissance Dam will start producing more than 5,000 megawatts of electric power within a year. Officials say such a production level would support the move to electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Repair services </strong></p>
<p>For now, many in Addis Ababa, a city of more than 5 million people, think the country is not ready to provide enough charging stations and repair services.</p>
<p>The few service station owners who can fix broken electric vehicles say they have too much work. And the EV owners say they are overcharged by repair shops because of a lack of competition. Many EVs are now parked, waiting for parts to come from China.</p>
<p>Bareo Hassen Bareo is the transport minister. Bareo believes Ethiopia can be a model nation with a green economy, especially with the move toward electric vehicles. He said that the government will invest in public charging stations and has plans to manufacture EV batteries to reduce imports. Private efforts to manufacture EVs with South Korean carmaker Hyundai in Ethiopia, however, have collapsed over sourcing of materials.</p>
<p><strong>Charging stations </strong></p>
<p>Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa, said the sudden flood of EVs into the country makes it difficult for owners to find charging stations. But, he believes Ethiopia can provide enough electricity for EVs within the next 10 years while meeting its industrial goals.</p>
<p>Some Ethiopians are already <strong>giving up</strong> on electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Yared Alemayehu sold his Chinese-made EV at a loss and bought a used Toyota Corolla. He said the EV “frequently broke,” and the repair shop “was overcharging.”</p>
<p>Taxi driver Dereje Hailu said he had high hopes for his Chinese-made EV earlier this year. But now, he says, "With such a car, I fear I might be <strong>stuck</strong> if I go far from Addis Ababa, where there are no charging stations,"</p>

            <title>Too Many Deer Live in England's Forests (2024/11/18)</title>

<p>Martin Edwards studies the shadows of the ancient forest from a high seat and waits. Sitting still, he watches with his special camera.</p>
<p>Then, Edwards aims and fires his rifle.</p>
<p>He has killed a male deer, or buck. It was one of many wild deer found in this forest in Hampshire, southern England.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Stag in rut bellows in early morning mist Bushy Park southwest London, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/f7e7fb7f-eb7b-4aa5-99b6-cebdce1b8b61_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A Stag in rut bellows in early morning mist Bushy Park southwest London, Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Alastair Grant)</span></div>
<p>Edwards supports controlling the deer population with a method called humane deer management.</p>
<p>The idea is to make sure the animals do not become too numerous for the forests and farmland in a country where deer no longer have natural predators. A predator is an animal that catches and kills other animals for food.</p>
<p><strong>Population </strong></p>
<p>There are now more deer in England than at any other time in the last 1,000 years, says the Forestry Commission, the government department looking after England's public forests.</p>
<p>An estimated 2 million deer now live in the country.</p>
<p>The high deer numbers have had a big effect on the environment, officials say. Deer have damaged large areas of woodland, including young trees, as well as the living areas of some birds like robins. Some landowners have lost large amounts of crops to deer. And overpopulation means that the animals are more likely to suffer from starvation and disease.</p>
<p>Forestry experts and businesses argue that killing the deer — and supplying the meat to <strong>consumers </strong>— is a good idea.</p>
<p>The reduced deer population can bring back balance to the environment and provide a low-fat, <strong>sustainable</strong> protein.</p>
<p><strong>Venison </strong></p>
<p>Deer meat is called venison. It is a red meat similar to lean beef but with a stronger flavor.</p>
<p>Although many in Britain see venison as a high-end food, one support group sees it as a good protein for those who do not have enough money to buy other meats.</p>
<p>“Why not utilize that<strong> fantastic</strong> meat to feed people in need?” said SJ Hunt of The Country Food Trust. The group gives meals made with wild venison to food banks.</p>
<p>The government says native wild deer play a role in healthy forest environments. Still, the government admits that the deer population needs controlling.</p>
<p>But experts like Edwards, a spokesman for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, believe killing them for meat is the only effective choice.</p>
<p>The deer population increased greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hunters, like everyone else, stayed home and the restaurant market — the main source for venison sales in Britain — disappeared overnight.</p>
<p>“There were no sales of venison and the price was absolutely on the floor,” said Ben Rigby, a leading venison and game meats seller. “The deer had a chance to breed <strong>massively</strong>.”</p>
<p>Rigby's company now processes hundreds of deer a week. The business sends venison or steaks to restaurants and food markets. One difficulty, Rigby said, is growing people's taste for venison. This is especially important after Brexit put new barriers up for exporting the meat.</p>
<p><strong>From the forest to the table </strong></p>
<p>In England, shooting deer is legal under some restrictions. Hunters must have a permit, use certain kinds of firearms and observe open seasons. They also need an acceptable or valid reason, such as when a landowner permits them to kill the deer when their land is damaged. Hunting deer with groups of dogs is illegal.</p>
<p>Making wild venison more widely available in food stores and beyond will bring out more hunters and ensure the meat does not go to waste, Edwards said.</p>
<p>Forestry England, which controls public forests, is part of the effort to increase venison use. In recent years, it supplied some hospitals with 1,000 kg of wild venison to use for food.</p>
<p>The approach appears to have been well received. However, it has gotten some criticism from animal welfare group PETA. PETA supports veganism – the practice of not eating or using animal products.</p>
<p>SJ Hunt of The Country Food Trust said it is possible to do much more with the meat. Her organization provided hundreds of thousands of venison meals to food banks last year — and people are hungry for more, she said.</p>
<p>She described the meat as nutritious and “free-range to the purest form of that definition.”</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>On this program we explore words and expressions in the English language. We give examples and notes on usage.</p>
<p>Many valuable materials are buried deep inside the ground, such as gold, oil and diamonds. But finding these riches and bringing them to the surface takes much time and effort.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - " and="" at="" black="" c.="" congress="" dillon="" dirt="" for="" gold="" grabill="" h.="" hills="" in="" lamb="" library="" of="" old="" panning="" rockervill="" s.d.="" spriggs="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/03370000-0aff-0242-c00c-08daf30a700c_cx4_cy12_cw90_w268_r1.jpeg" the="" timers="" work=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - "Old timers, Spriggs, Lamb and Dillon at work" panning for gold (pay dirt) at Rockervill, S.D., in the Black Hills, 1889. (John C. H. Grabill/Library of Congress)</span></div>
<p>In the past, the term <u>pay dirt </u>was used to describe something found in the dirt that could bring you money. Gold is a common example of pay dirt. In fact, word experts say the term dates back to when North America's famous gold rush was happening.</p>
<p>By the mid-1800s, thousands of people had come to parts of the United States and Canada to search for gold. The work was hard and dangerous. The weather and <strong>terrain</strong> presented many difficulties.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to use <u>pay dirt</u> from <a class="wsw__a" href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/pay-dirt">Cambridge's</a> online dictionary:</p>
<p><em>Gold rushes continued into the 19th century as lucky <strong>prospectors</strong> struck <u>pay dirt</u>.</em></p>
<p>However, <u>pay dirt</u> does not have to be a valuable material found in the ground. These days, it can also describe something that produces money or profit. Or it can even be the money or profit itself.</p>
<p>Here are some additional examples:</p>
<p><em>Email addresses are the new <u>pay dirt</u> in social media marketing. You can reach a possible buyer in their inbox.</em></p>
<p><em>The musical group <u>hit pay dirt</u> with their song after it went viral on TikTok. </em></p>
<p>And that gives us the expression <u>to hit pay dirt.</u></p>
<p><u>To hit pay dirt</u> means to do or find something that results in money or success. And like digging gold, it usually doesn't come easily. It requires work. When you <u>hit pay dirt,</u> you work hard to make money or profit from an idea or activity.</p>
<p>We often use the verb “hit” when using the term <u>pay dirt</u>. But sometimes we also say “strike” pay dirt. This is similar to the expression <u>to strike it rich</u>. Many people have dreams of <u>striking it rich</u> one day.</p>
<p>In her book <em>Gold Rush</em>, author and illustrator Flora Delargy describes the process of <u>hitting pay dirt</u>. She writes that in order to get large amounts of <u>pay dirt</u> out of the ground, “<strong>miners</strong> would have to break through layers of <strong>permafrost</strong> to reach the <strong>gravel</strong> <strong>bedrock</strong> beneath.”</p>
<p>This description demonstrates the difficulties faced by miners seeking to <u>strike pay dirt.</u></p>

<p>Technology company Microsoft is working with the Roman Catholic Church to create a detailed, digital version of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.</p>
<p>The project aims to give people a new way to experience the famous building, which sits in the Catholic Church's spiritual and administrative center in Rome.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic leaders recently joined Microsoft's President Brad Smith to present the new digital creation to the public. The official launch of the system has been set for December 1. It will permit individuals to explore St. Peter's Basilica online and provide interactive experiences for all visitors to the Vatican.</p><div class="contentImage"><img ai-enhanced="" alt="A view of St. Peter's basilica during the preview to the press of the exhibition 'Petros eni', which is part of the project " at="" basilica:="" borgia="" experience="" gregorio="" nov.="" peter="" photo="" saturday="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/629ce677-eb1d-493b-841c-4de7dd60cd85_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg" st.="" the="" vatican=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A view of St. Peter's basilica during the preview to the press of the exhibition 'Petros eni', which is part of the project "St. Peter's Basilica: AI-Enhanced Experience" at the Vatican, Saturday, Nov. 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)</span></div>
<p>The effort involved <strong>drones </strong>flying around the empty basilica for four weeks to capture images of all parts of the building. The drones – equipped with many cameras and lasers – took more than 400,000 high-quality pictures.</p>
<p>The process used artificial intelligence (AI) methods to create a complete 3D copy of the basilica. One goal of the project was to provide a way for anyone in the world to have the chance to “visit” the church and learn about its history.</p>
<p>Microsoft chief Smith told a press conference at Vatican City the project represented “one of the most technologically <strong>advanced</strong> and <strong>sophisticated</strong> projects of its kind” ever carried out.</p>
<p>Cardinal Mauro Gambetti is the Archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica. He <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2024-11/ai-technology-st-peters-basilica-digital-experience-microsoft.html">praised</a> the new technology at the press conference. Gambetti compared the highly detailed digital experience to looking up at a “starry sky on a summer night.” He added, “The new tools act like a telescope or spaceship for better viewing.”</p>
<p>The project was launched ahead of the Vatican's 2025 Jubilee celebration. This marks a holy year at the Vatican when more than 30 million <strong>worshippers</strong> are expected to visit the basilica. This will be in addition to the 50,000 people who visit on a normal day. The basilica will celebrate its 400th anniversary in 2026.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported Pope Francis visited Smith and the project's development teams at the Vatican. He said the effort should help everyone “feel welcome in this great house.”</p>
<p>The pope added that the project was a way to recognize and continue to celebrate the Vatican's rich spiritual history. “...It is a gift and a <strong>task</strong> to care for it, in both a spiritual and material sense, even through the latest technologies,” he said.</p>
<p>Pope Francis has warned that AI should only be used in <strong>ethical </strong>ways.<strong> </strong>In his World Message of Peace this year, he proposed an international treaty to control, or regulate, the technology. He argued that AI systems lack human values and could cause great harm.</p>
<p>The digital system permits visitors to request entry times to the basilica. This could be a welcome change for visitors used to waiting in lines for hours to get into the basilica, which is one of the world's most visited buildings.</p>
<p>The collected images have already identified structural damage and signs of <strong>deterioration</strong>.<strong> </strong>Experts said the technology can find such problems much faster and more effectively than human workers. Vatican officials plan to use the images to continually identify areas needing repairs.</p>
<p>Smith did not say how much Microsoft had invested in the project. But he said the idea came after Pope Francis urged technology companies in 2018 to come together to use AI for cultural purposes.</p>
<p>Smith noted his company had also completed similar AI projects at Mont Saint-Michel in France and for Ancient Olympia in Greece.</p>

            <title>Most and Almost (2024/11/16)</title>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Paola in Bolivia about the usage of the words “most” and “almost."</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/65b023c9-e43f-4975-9b87-f1256728ff9a_w268_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>I am having some confusion about the words “most” and “almost.” Sometimes they seem like the same to me, and I wish to know how they can be different.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Paola</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Paola.</p>
<p>The word “almost” is an adverb. The word “most” can be an adjective, adverb, or quantifier. A quantifier is a word that describes how much of something there is. The words “more,” “some,” and “all” are other examples of quantifiers.</p>
<p>As a quantifier, “most” simply means a majority of a group or the largest part of something. However, the phrase “almost all of” means nearly all of something, such as 90 percent or more.</p>
<p><strong>When to use the preposition “of”</strong></p>
<p>Some English learners have difficulty knowing when to use the preposition “of” with the words “most” or “almost.”</p>
<p>We cannot put the <strong>preposition</strong> “of” directly after the adverb “almost”. Instead, we must use the two words “all of” after “almost” to describe a noun, as in this example:</p>
<p><em><u>Almost all of the</u></em><em> children who got sick felt better within 48 hours. </em></p>
<p>When we use the word “most” as an adjective, we can simply put a noun directly after it when we are describing something in general, as in this example:</p>
<p><em><u>Most</u> children enjoy playing games.</em></p>
<p>However, we use the preposition “of” after the adjective “most” when we describe something specific. The following two examples show this:</p>
<p><em><u>Most of the</u> children in his class enjoy playing this game. </em></p>
<p><em><u>Most of his</u> friends live in the city. </em></p>
<p><strong>More uses of most and almost</strong></p>
<p>The adverb “almost” means “very nearly or very close.” For example, if you have a job to do that takes an hour to finish and you have already worked 55 minutes, you can say:</p>
<p><em>I am <u>almost</u> finished.</em></p>
<p>As an adverb, the word “most” can describe another adjective, as in this example:</p>
<p><em>That was <u>the most beautiful</u> sunset I have seen in a long time. </em></p>
<p>We sometimes use “most” -- without the word “the” -- as an adverb after any form of the verb “be.”</p>
<p><em>The thing <u>I'm most worried about</u> is her health.</em></p>
<p>Note, however, that we also often use the word “the” before “most.”</p>
<p><em>The thing I'm <u>the most worried about</u> is her health. </em></p>

            <title>Scientists Identify Misunderstanding about Uranus (2024/11/15)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/scientists-identify-misunderstanding-about-uranus.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">14 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>In 1781, German-born British astronomer William Herschel made Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope. But, 243 years later, we still do not know much about this cold planet, the third largest in our solar system. And some of what we thought we knew about it turns out to be untrue.</p>
<p>Much of the knowledge about Uranus was collected when NASA's robotic spacecraft Voyager 2 flew past it in 1986. But scientists have since learned that the craft visited at a time of unusual conditions. An intense solar wind event at the time led to misleading observations about Uranus, and especially its magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>Observations in a solar wind event</strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An image of the planet Uranus taken by the NASA spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986. (NASA/JPL/Handout via REUTERS )" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/b866f7af-b6b1-4a5b-a65b-ec143da00494_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - An image of the planet Uranus taken by the NASA spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986. (NASA/JPL/Handout via REUTERS )</span></div>
<p>The solar wind is a high-speed flow of charged particles coming from the sun. The researchers took a second look at eight months of data from around the time of Voyager 2's visit and found that it flew near Uranus just a few days after the solar wind had reduced the planet's magnetosphere to about 20 percent of its usual size.</p>
<p>A <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/focus-areas/magnetosphere-ionosphere/">magnetosphere</a> is an area of space surrounding a planet that is controlled by the planet's magnetic field. The magnetosphere protects the planet from solar and cosmic particle radiation.</p>
<p>The Voyager 2 observations led scientists to think Uranus' magnetosphere lacked in plasma and had very intense belts of highly energetic electrons.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.psfc.mit.edu/vision/what_is_plasma">Plasma</a> is often called the fourth state of matter after solids, liquids and gases. In the night sky, plasma gives out light in the form of stars, <strong>nebulas</strong>, and even the <strong>auroras</strong> above the north and south poles. Plasma is a common feature in the magnetosphere of other planets, so scientists did not understand why there would not be much of it observed around Uranus.</p>
<p>Jamie Jasinski studies space plasma at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is the lead writer of the study published recently in the publication <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02389-3"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>
<p>"We found that the solar wind conditions present during the flyby only <strong>occur</strong> 4 percent of the time. The flyby occurred during the maximum <strong>peak</strong> solar wind intensity in that entire eight-month period," Jasinski said. "We would have observed a much bigger magnetosphere if Voyager 2 had arrived a week earlier.”</p>
<p>Such a visit would likely have shown that the Uranus magnetosphere is like those of Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune, the solar system's other large planets, the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>Future exploration</strong></p>
<p>Uranus looks blue green because of the methane contained in its atmosphere. The planet is big enough to fit 63 Earths inside it. Among the solar system's eight planets, only Jupiter and Saturn are larger.</p>
<p>Uranus orbits almost 20 times further from the sun than Earth does. And it has 28 known moons and two sets of rings.</p>
<p>Data collected by Voyager 2 had suggested that its two largest moons - Titania and Oberon - often orbit outside the magnetosphere. But the new study shows that they usually stay inside the protective space, making it easier for scientists to magnetically <strong>detect</strong> possible subsurface oceans.</p>
<p>"Both are thought to be <strong>prime</strong> candidates for hosting liquid water oceans in the Uranian system...," Jet Propulsion Laboratory planetary scientist and study co-writer Corey Cochrane said.</p>
<p>Scientists want to learn whether subsurface oceans on moons in the outer solar system have conditions that could support life. So, on October 14, NASA launched a spacecraft on a mission to Jupiter's moon Europa to try to answer that question.</p>
<p>"A future mission to Uranus is <strong>crucial</strong> to understanding not only the planet and magnetosphere, but also its atmosphere, rings and moons," Jasinski said.</p>

            <title>An Introduction to Verb Tenses (2024/11/15)</title>

<p>For VOA Learning English, this is Everyday Grammar.</p>
<p>Today we are going to give you a basic overview of the verb tense system in English.</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c1b55610-3750-4060-934d-8a5ed2cdcc08_w268_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>Verb tenses tell us how an action relates to the flow of time.</p>
<p>There are three main verb tenses in English: <em>present, past </em>and <em>future</em>. The present, past and future tenses are divided into four <strong>aspects</strong>: the <em>simple, progressive, perfect </em>and<em> perfect progressive</em>.</p>
<p>There are 12 major verb tenses that English learners should know.</p>
<p>English has only two ways of forming a tense from the verb alone: the past and the present. For example,</p>
<p><em>We drove</em> and <em>we drive</em>.</p>
<p>To form other verb tenses, you have to add a form of <em>have, be </em>or <em>will</em> in front of the verb. These are called helping, or <strong>auxiliary verbs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Time, culture, and grammar</strong></p>
<p>Verb tenses can be difficult to learn in a foreign language. Different cultures think different ways about time. Chinese, for example, has no grammatical verb tenses. Other languages, like Indonesian, express time only through adverbs — there are no changes to the verb form.</p>
<p>English verb tenses give many details about time and action such as:</p>
<p><em>Is the action finished? How long did the action happen? Was the action repeated? Did the action happen at a known or unknown time? Is the action a habit? Is the action planned or <strong>spontaneous</strong>?</em></p>
<p>It is difficult to think about time <strong>distinctions</strong> that do not exist in your own language. So, it can take many years for English learners to master verb tenses.</p>
<p>Let's get started. We are going to give examples of all 12 verb tenses using the verb <em>drive</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Simple tenses</strong></p>
<p>We'll start with the simple tenses. These are probably the first tenses you learned in English. Simple tenses usually refer to a single action. In general, simple tenses express facts and situations that existed in the past, exist in the present, or will exist in the future.</p>
<p>Simple present: <em>I drive home every day.</em></p>
<p>Simple past: <em>I drove home yesterday.</em></p>
<p>Simple future: <em>I will drive home later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Progressive (continuous) tenses</strong></p>
<p>Let's go on to the progressive tenses. We use progressive tenses to talk about unfinished events. Progressive tenses are also called <em>continuous</em> tenses.</p>
<p>Past progressive: <em>I was driving when you called.</em></p>
<p>Present progressive: <em>I am driving now. </em></p>
<p>Future progressive: <em>I will be driving when you call.</em></p>
<p><strong>Perfect tenses</strong></p>
<p>Now let's look at the perfect tenses. Perfect tenses cause the most confusion. To put it simply, they express the idea that one event happens before another event.</p>
<p>There are many tricky exceptions with the perfect tenses, which we will discuss in a future episode. The adverbs <em>never, yet </em>and<em> already </em>are common in perfect tenses.</p>
<p>Present perfect: <em>I have driven that road.</em></p>
<p>Past perfect:<em> I had already driven that road in the past. </em></p>
<p>Future perfect:<em> I will have driven 200 miles by tomorrow.</em></p>
<p><strong>Perfect progressive tenses</strong></p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the perfect progressive tenses. Generally, perfect progressive tenses express duration, or <em>how long</em>? Perfect progressive tenses usually include the adverbs <em>for </em>or<em> since</em>.</p>
<p>Present perfect progressive: <em>I have been driving since this morning.</em></p>
<p>Past perfect progressive: <em>I had been driving for three hours before I stopped to get gas.</em></p>
<p>Future perfect progressive:<em> I will have been driving for five hours by the time I arrive.</em></p>
<p>Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet. Here are some recommendations we have for learning verb tenses.</p>
<p><strong>Adverbs are your friends</strong></p>
<p>First, think of adverbs as your friends. Adverbs of time offer valuable clues about the correct verb tense.</p>
<p>Let's use the adverb <em>ago</em>. <em>Ago </em>is only used in the simple past as in, “I left home three years ago.” The adverb<em> ago</em> is never used in the present perfect. Certain adverbs occur with certain verb tenses.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>English learners sometimes try to impress people by using complex verb tenses. You often have a choice of several verb tenses. When you do, always choose the simplest one. It will be clearer for your listener, and there is less chance of making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Practice with questions</strong></p>
<p>Native speakers don't think <strong>consciously</strong> about verb tenses. With enough practice, English learners can internalize the verb tense system, too. Instead of worrying about deep time relationships, try using adverbs and your ear to choose the right verb tense.</p>
<p>Often when someone asks a question, you can respond in the same verb tense. We'll ask a question in each verb tense. Give an answer in the same tense, then listen to our answer.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>1. Did you get enough sleep last night? (simple past)</p>
<p><em>Yes, I slept well.</em></p>
<p>2. Do you shower every day? (simple present)</p>
<p><em>Yes, I shower every day.</em></p>
<p>3. Are you going to study tonight? (simple future)</p>
<p><em>Yes, I'm going to study tonight.</em></p>
<p>4. What were you doing when I called you last night? (past progressive)</p>
<p><em>I was eating dinner when you called me last night.</em></p>
<p>5. What are you doing right now? (present progressive)</p>
<p><em>I am practicing verb tenses right now.</em></p>
<p>6. What will you be doing at midnight on New Year's Eve? (future progressive)</p>
<p><em>I will be celebrating the New Year with my friends.</em></p>
<p>7. Had you ever tried skiing before today? (past perfect)</p>
<p><em>Yes, I had already done it several times before.</em></p>
<p>8. Have you ever broken the law? (present perfect)</p>
<p><em>No, I have never broken the law.</em></p>
<p>9. Will you have gotten married by the time you turn 30? (future perfect)</p>
<p><em>No, I will not have gotten married by the time I turn 30.</em></p>
<p>10. How long had you been smoking before you quit? (past perfect progressive)</p>
<p><em>I had been smoking for two years before I quit.</em></p>
<p>11. How long have you been waiting for the bus? (present perfect progressive)</p>
<p><em>I have been waiting for the bus for 20 minutes.</em></p>
<p>12. How long will you have been working before you retire? (future perfect progressive)</p>
<p><em>I will have been working for 30 years before I retire.</em></p>
<p>This is just a basic introduction to verb tenses. In the following weeks, we will cover the more difficult verb tenses in more detail.</p>

            <title>Australia Plans Social Media Ban for Children under 16 (2024/11/14)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Andrew Smith</span><br/><span class="datetime">13 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The Australian government recently announced plans to ban the use of social media by children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, “Social media is doing harm to our kids.” He added that now is the time for the government to intervene.</p>
<p>The country's Parliament will introduce a new bill during the final two weeks of its meeting starting on November 18. The bill will set an age limit of 16 for children to use social media and make the services responsible for enforcement.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - In this Sept. 28, 2020 file photo, The TikTok app logo appears in Tokyo. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/B0E5B92F-5EA1-4085-9748-D2BF2AEB1CE7_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - In this Sept. 28, 2020 file photo, The TikTok app logo appears in Tokyo.

<p>Albanese told reporters that the age limit would take effect 12 months after the bill is passed. And social media services, including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, would need to use the year to work out how to put age controls in place.</p>
<p>“I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,” Albanese said.</p>
<p>The proposal comes at a time when governments around the world are considering ways to control how young people use smartphones and social media.</p>
<p>Under the Australian proposal, social media companies would face <strong>penalties</strong> for violating the age limit. However, under-age children and their parents would not face penalties.</p>
<p>Antigone Davis is the head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Davis said the company would respect any age limits the government wants to put in place. She added that officials need to discuss the ways social media can make the age limit happen. She suggested that stronger tools in app stores and computer systems for parents could be a “simple and effective solution.”</p>
<p>X did not immediately answer a request from The Associated Press (AP) for comment. TikTok said it would not offer a comment to the AP.</p>
<p><strong>Some groups oppose the age limit</strong></p>
<p>More than 140 experts in fields related to technology and children signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit. The letter said a ban would not be an effective way to deal with the risks of social media use.</p>
<p>Sunita Bose is a director at the Digital Industry Group in Australia. Bose said in a statement, “Rather than blocking <strong>access</strong> through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-<strong>appropriate</strong> spaces, build digital <strong>literacy</strong> and protect young people from online harm.”</p>
<p>Jackie Hallan is a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut. She also opposed the ban. She noted that 73 percent of young people across Australia seeking mental health support get it through social media. She added that young people are likely to find ways to use social media even with a ban in place.</p>
<p>Child psychologist Philip Tam said it would have been easier to enforce the ban for children under the age of 12 or 13. Tam said, “My real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground.”</p>
<p>Prime Minister Albanese said there would be rules to permit social media use in some situations, such as a need to connect with educational services.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the government began testing age-restriction technologies among a group of users. Officials will use the test results to guide what reasonable steps social media services can take.</p>
<p>Lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the services already have the technology to enforce such an age ban. He added that if the law for controlling social media use is well written, Australia can get the results it wants.</p>

            <title>Researchers: Huge Drop in African Elephants (2024/11/14)</title>

<p>African elephants are Earth's largest land animals. They are very intelligent and highly social. A recent study also says that numbers of African elephants sharply decreased over about fifty years.</p>
<p>The researchers described their work as the most <strong>comprehensive</strong> study of the two African elephant <strong>species</strong> - the savanna elephant and forest elephant. The study used data gathered at 475 areas in 37 countries from 1964 through 2016.</p>
<p>It found that savanna elephant populations fell by about 70 percent on average and forest elephant populations dropped by about 90 percent on average. The researchers mainly blame the <strong>decline</strong> on illegal hunting and the loss of the animals' natural environment.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Elephants walk at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County, Kenya, April 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Monicah Mwangi/File Photo)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c1e04c39-fe8b-463d-b99d-2c219e20f812_cx7_cy7_cw88_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Elephants walk at the Amboseli National Park in Kajiado County, Kenya, April 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Monicah Mwangi/File Photo)</span></div>
<p>However, the report also says populations of each species increased in other places because of wildlife protection programs.</p>
<p>"A lot of the lost populations won't come back, and many low-density populations face continued pressures. We likely will lose more populations going forward,” said George Wittemyer. He is a Colorado State University professor who works with the conservation group Save the Elephants. Wittemyer helped lead the study, published in the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403816121" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Illegal hunting of animals is also called poaching. Elephant poachers usually kill the animals in order to remove their tusks. These prized objects are then sold on illegal markets, driven mostly by demand in China and other parts of Asia.</p>
<p>The research says agricultural expansion is mainly responsible for the loss of elephant habitat, meaning the natural areas where the animal lives.</p>
<p>Poaching has mostly affected forest elephants. Its population is estimated to be about one-third that of savanna elephants. Poaching has been especially damaged populations in northern and eastern Africa, such as Mali, Chad and Nigeria. But, in southern Africa, elephant populations rose at 42 percent of the studied areas.</p>
<p>"We have seen real success in a number of places across Africa, but particularly in southern Africa, with strong growth in populations in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia,” Wittemyer said. He credited conservation efforts by governments and independent organizations for the growth.</p>
<p>The study did not provide a continent-wide population count. It says the different methods used for counting over different periods made it impossible to keep a unified count of the African elephants. Instead, it estimates population<strong> trends</strong> in each of the studied areas.</p>
<p>A separate report from conservationists places the population of African elephants at between 415,000 and 540,000 as of 2016, the last year of the study period. It remains the most recent comprehensive continent-wide estimate.</p>
<p>Colorado State's Wittemyer said, "While the trends are not good, it is important to recognize the successes we have had and continue to have. Learning how and where we can be successful in conserving elephants is as important as recognizing the severity of the decline they have experienced."</p>

            <title>Pistachios Becoming Major Crop in California (2024/11/14)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>In a large plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of pistachios are inspected, prepared and shipped off around the world.</p>
<p>Pistachios, a kind of nut, have been around for over 3,000 years. First planted in central Asia, pistachios arrived in California in the 1850s along with thousands of people during the Gold Rush.</p>
<p>Since pistachios require little water, farmers have been using more land for the crops in California. Pistachios brought in nearly $3 billion last year in the state. And, in the past ten years, the United States has gone beyond Iran to become the world's top exporter of the nut.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Pistachios are hand sorted at the Wonderful Pistachios &amp; Almonds processing plant in Lost Hills, Calif., on Friday, Oct. 25, 2024.

<p>“There has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,” said Zachary Fraser. He is president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, an organization that represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. “You are starting to see the fruit of people's vision from 40 years ago.”</p>
<p>California agricultural data shows that the state grows more than a third of vegetables and three-fourths of fruits and nuts in the U.S.</p>
<p>Pistachios have increased over the past ten years to become California's sixth-biggest agricultural product. The nuts have increased in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.</p>
<p>Much of the pistachio crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans are also eating more pistachios.</p>
<p>The nuts were rarely seen in food stores a generation ago and today are found almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Pistachios are sold with or without shells. Their flavors range from salt and pepper to honey-roasted.</p>
<p>The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s. But it increased production in 2015 after developing a <strong>rootstock </strong>that produces as much as 40 percent more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.</p>
<p>Now, Wonderful grows between 15 percent and 20 percent of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said.</p>
<p>“There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,” Yraceburu said. “The world wants more.”</p>
<p><strong>Pistachios weather dry times better </strong></p>
<p>Pistachios are set to weather California's dry times better than the state's even bigger nut crop, almonds.</p>
<p>Almonds produced nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.</p>
<p>Pistachio orchards can survive with minimal water during<strong> drought</strong>, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also use wind instead of bees for <strong>pollination</strong> and can produce nuts for many years longer, Yraceburu said.</p>
<p>Many California farmers who grow pistachios and almonds are using lessons learned from almond farming. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also increased quickly in California. But prices fell amid a large amount of post-pandemic supply. At the same time, farmers faced a time of too little water and rising input costs.</p>
<p>As a result, some farmers did not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.</p>
<p>Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar outcome and are working to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently signed a deal with a top <strong>cricket</strong> player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.</p>
<p>The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' move into perennial crops, commanding higher returns than products such as cotton. Perennial crops, which are not replanted every year, cannot just be changed out during dry years. As a result, they can be difficult during long periods with too little water, said Brad Franklin of the Public Policy Institute of California.</p>
<p>But pistachios have <strong>benefits</strong> that other perennial crops do not have. They can go longer without water and grow in salty soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can use under a new state law, he said.</p>

            <title>Webb Telescope Shows a Black Hole Breaking a Theoretical Limit (2024/11/13)</title>

<p>Researchers have observed a large black hole that gained mass at a rate much faster than scientists had thought possible.</p>
<p>New observations from the Webb telescope involve the largest kind of black hole, a <strong>supermassive </strong>black hole. It is called LID-568. Scientists say it existed when the universe was about 11 percent of its current age.</p>
<p><strong>Background of a black hole </strong></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="An artist's illustration shows a rapidly feeding black hole that is emitting powerful gas outflows. (NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/J. da Silva/M. Zamani/Handout via REUTERS)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/74d24335-d04e-469f-b310-1771860d797a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">An artist's illustration shows a rapidly feeding black hole that is emitting powerful gas outflows. (NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/J. da Silva/M. Zamani/Handout via REUTERS)</span></div>
<p>Black holes are extremely dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. With their powerful gravitational pull, they grow in mass by taking in material such as gas, dust and stars that are nearby.</p>
<p>A supermassive black hole about four million times the mass of the sun, called Sagittarius A*, is at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. Supermassive black holes are believed to be at the center of most galaxies.</p>
<p>Since NASA's James Webb Space Telescope started operating in 2022, researchers have been surprised to find supermassive black holes in the early universe. Researchers had believed that it takes a longer amount of time to gather such huge amounts of mass.</p>
<p>New observations of one early black hole give information about how this growth took place.</p>
<p>"The existence of supermassive black holes in the early universe <strong>challenges</strong> our current models of black hole formation and growth," said Hyewon Suh of the International Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and the U.S. National Science Foundation's NOIRLab. Suh was the lead writer of the study detailing the findings in the scientific publication Nature Astronomy.</p>
<p>The supermassive black hole LID-568 existed about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. The Big Bang, the event that started the universe, took place around 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>LID-568 has a mass 10 million times greater than the sun, or two- and one-half times the mass of Sagittarius A*. The researchers do not yet know the mass of its home galaxy.</p>
<p>The Webb telescope showed LID-568 gaining mass at a rate faster than scientists had thought possible. LID-568 appeared to be <strong>consuming</strong> <strong>infalling </strong>material - known as<strong> accretion</strong> - at more than 40 times the previously believed maximum for such activity.</p>
<p>This maximum is known as the Eddington limit.</p>
<p><strong>Exceeding the Eddington Limit </strong></p>
<p>Early black holes are thought to have started in one of two ways. They could have begun after the explosive death of the universe's first generation of stars or through the collapse of large clouds of gas present in the early universe.</p>
<p>The discovery of LID-568 suggests that a lot of mass growth can take place during one time, or episode, of rapid accretion, Suh suggested.</p>
<p>A good sign of a growing supermassive black hole is <strong>emission</strong> of X-rays, high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very short wavelengths. Material moving around a supermassive black hole is superheated and glows strongly in X-ray wavelengths before disappearing in the black hole.</p>
<p>The researchers first spotted LID-568 using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. They then studied it more closely with the Webb space telescope.</p>
<p>The Webb observations suggest the existence of a faster way for black holes to take in material.</p>
<p>Suh described LID-568 as “remarkable.” She added, "We don't know yet how LID-568 is able to exceed the Eddington limit. To investigate further, we need more data, so we are planning to <strong>conduct</strong> follow-up observations with Webb."</p>

            <title>Europe Scientists Predict Another World Heat Record (2024/11/13)</title>

<p>Europe's climate agency says this year is likely to break 2023's record for the hottest year ever.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Copernicus agency also predicted 2024 will be the first year to be more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than what is called the pre-industrial period. That period, from 1850 to 1900, is when humans began the widespread burning of <strong>fossil fuels</strong>.</p>
<p>The new data was released ahead of the United Nations COP29 climate meeting taking place this week in Azerbaijan. At that meeting, international representatives are expected to agree to call for more spending to fight the worldwide effects of climate change.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Tourists with an umbrella walk in front of the Parthenon at the ancient Acropolis in central Athens, June 12, 2024.

<p>The European climate agency said that from January to October, the average world temperature rose so much that 2024 would almost surely be the world's hottest year on record.</p>
<p>Copernicus said its records date back to 1940 and are compared with world temperature records going back to 1850.</p>
<p>The director of Copernicus, Carlo Buontempo, told Reuters news agency the main cause of this year's record is climate change. "The climate is warming, generally. It's warming in all <strong>continents</strong>, in all ocean <strong>basins</strong>. So we are bound to see those records being broken," Buontempo said.</p>
<p>Buontempo also said the data clearly show such warming would not be happening without the continued release of carbon <strong>emissions</strong> into the atmosphere. Scientists say carbon dioxide is released by the burning of coal, oil and gas.</p>
<p>Buontempo noted the importance of worldwide observations and data collection to support the group's findings and predictions. Copernicus gathers data from billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.</p>
<p>Sonia Seneviratne is a climate scientist at public research university ETH Zurich in Switzerland. She told Reuters she was not surprised by the new prediction.</p>
<p>Seneviratne urged delegates at COP29 to agree to stronger action to limit the use of carbon-producing fossil fuels. "The limits that were set in the Paris agreement are starting to <strong>crumble</strong> given the too-slow pace of climate action across the world," she said.</p>
<p>Many countries agreed to try to prevent the average temperature of the atmosphere from increasing by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius over a period of years by signing the 2015 Paris Agreement. Officials from Copernicus have said that the 1.5-degree Celsius limit could be passed around 2030. "It's basically <strong>around the corner</strong> now," Buontempo said.</p>
<p>Climate scientists say each increase in temperature can fuel extreme weather. Recent examples of weather-related events include flooding that killed hundreds of people in Spain and wildfires in Peru. In Bangladesh, flooding destroyed more than 1 million tons of rice, driving food prices higher.</p>

<p>The small satellite, called LignoSat, launched aboard an uncrewed Cargo Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). The satellite will later be released into orbit about 400 kilometers above Earth.</p>
<p>The satellite was built in the form of a box, with each side measuring about 10 centimeters.

<p>A spokeswoman for Sumitomo Forestry told the French news agency AFP that the launch of the satellite was “successful.” She said the plan calls for the device to be released into orbit in about a month, when its strength and effectiveness will be tested.</p>
<p>While made mostly of wood, LignoSat contains electronic elements that will control its movements and collect data on its operation. Once deployed, the satellite is expected to remain in orbit for about six months.</p>

<p>The main goal of the experimental satellite is to see whether wood material can be used to build additional satellites or other space equipment. Wood is considered more environmental friendly. This is because it can just burn up when reentering Earth's atmosphere. Satellites and other materials made of metal can release polluting particles into the air and oceans upon reentry.</p>
<p>International officials have already identified space<strong> junk</strong> as a growing problem. This includes things like dead satellites, lost pieces of equipment or small pieces of paint. Such objects can present threats to spacecraft and satellites operating in space.</p>
<p>Takao Doi is an astronaut who has flown on past space missions and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. He told Reuters he thinks wood can greatly improve future stays for long-term space travelers. "With <strong>timber</strong>, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever," Doi said.</p>
<p>He added that the experiment is designed to demonstrate the abilities of wood to serve as a suitable material for developing future space equipment.</p>
<p>"Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood," said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. "A wooden satellite should be <strong>feasible</strong>, too." Murata noted that wood can last longer in space than on Earth because water or oxygen cannot burn or destroy it.</p>
<p>Doi said it is possible metal satellites could be banned in the future. "If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to <strong>pitch</strong> it to Elon Musk's SpaceX."</p>
<p>The team said a 10-month experiment aboard the ISS found that honoki – a native tree in Japan and traditionally used to make <strong>sword</strong> covers – is well-suited for spacecraft. LignoSat is made of honoki as part of a traditional Japanese <strong>crafting </strong>method that does not use screws or glue.</p>
<p>Kenji Kariya is a leader at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. He told Reuters the wooden satellite will also test the ability of the material to reduce the effects of space radiation on <strong>semiconductors</strong>.</p>
<p>"It may seem <strong>outdated</strong>, but wood is actually <strong>cutting-edge</strong> technology as civilization heads to the moon and Mars." Kariya noted that expanding into space technologies could support the timber industry.</p>

<p>From VOA Learning English, this is the <em>Health &amp; Lifestyle</em> report.</p>
<p>As fall and winter come to some parts of the world, daylight hours grow shorter. This lack of light can cause seasonal depression.</p>
<p>“It (is) a feeling of <strong>panic</strong>, fear, <strong>anxiety</strong> and <strong>dread</strong> all in one,” said Germaine Pataki. The 63-year-old woman living in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, is among the millions of people estimated to have seasonal affective disorder, or SAD.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A lone walker moves around Washington Park as a winter storm packing wet, heavy snow moves through the area on Feb. 3, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/4f86da14-3c48-4005-946e-9969621ddab1_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A lone walker moves around Washington Park as a winter storm packing wet, heavy snow moves through the area on Feb. 3, 2024, in Denver. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)</span></div>
<p>To deal with her condition, Pataki uses yoga, walking, and an antidepressant medication. She is also part of a Facebook group for people with SAD and helps others deal with the condition. Pataki said, “This gives me purpose.”</p>
<p>People with SAD usually have depression that begins in the fall and eases in the spring or summer. Changing the clocks back to standard time, which happens in autumn in the United States, can also cause SAD to start.</p>
<p>Medical experts say there is a milder form, called subsyndromal SAD. There is also summer seasonal depression but less is known about that.</p>
<p>In 1984, a team led by Dr. Norman Rosenthal, then a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, first described SAD. He invented the term.</p>
<p><strong>What causes seasonal affective disorder?</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are still learning the causes of seasonal affective disorder. They have found that specialized cells in our eyes turn the blue wavelength of the light into neural, or brain signals. These signals affect <strong>mood</strong> and wakefulness, or <strong>alertness</strong>.</p>
<p>Sunlight has a lot of blue light. So, when the cells sense this blue light, the alertness centers of our brains turn on. We feel more alert and possibly even happier.</p>
<p>Kathryn Roecklein is a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. She tested people with and without SAD to see how their eyes reacted to blue light. As a group, people with SAD were less sensitive to blue light than others, especially during winter months. That suggests a cause for wintertime depression.</p>
<p>“In the winter, when the light levels drop, that, combined with a lower sensitivity, might be too low for healthy <strong>functioning</strong>, leading to depression,” Roecklein said.</p>
<p>Miriam Cherry is 50 years old and lives in New York state. She spent the summer planning how she would deal with her winter depression. “It's like clockwork,” Cherry said. “The sunlight is low. The day ends at 4:45, and suddenly my mood is <strong>horrible</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>Light therapy can help</strong></p>
<p>Many people with SAD respond to light <strong>therapy</strong>, said Dr. Paul Desan of Yale University's Winter Depression Research Clinic. The therapy devices give off light about 20 times brighter than regular indoor light.</p>
<p>“The first thing to try is light,” Desan said. “When we get patients on <strong>exposure </strong>to bright light for a half an hour or so every morning, the majority of patients get <strong>dramatically</strong> better. We don't even need medications.”</p>
<p>There is research that supports the idea that using a light that has a brightness of about 10,000 lux can be helpful. Lux is a measurement of brightness.</p>
<p>The research suggests that a person use it for 30 minutes every morning. Desan said this can help not only people with SAD but also those with less-severe, low moods in winter.</p>
<p><strong>What else might work?</strong></p>
<p>Experts suggest other forms of treatment. Doctors often suggest antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for SAD. They also suggest going to bed and waking up at about the same time each day. Also, exercise such as walking outside, even on cloudy days, can help.</p>
<p>Kelly Rohan is a researcher at the University of Vermont. Rohan said another treatment is talk therapy. Also called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, Rohan said it has been shown in studies to have more long-lasting effects. CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and change unhelpful thoughts.</p>
<p>“A very common thought that people have is ‘I hate winter,'” Rohan said. She suggests that people instead say, “I <strong>prefer</strong> summer to winter.”</p>
<p>Working with a therapist can help people take small steps toward having fun again, Rohan said. Try planning undemanding but enjoyable activities to break out of a bad mood. Rohan said simply meeting a friend for coffee can help.</p>
<p>People with SAD have half the year to create helpful methods. Some have found things that work for them -- although they might not be the subject of scientific research.</p>
<p>For example, in Folsom, California, Elizabeth Wescott says she believes a kind of water therapy helps her. The 69-year-old uses water therapy used in sports medicine. When she showers, she changes between hot and cold water. She also uses a light box and takes an antidepressant. “I'm always looking for new tools,” Wescott said.</p>
<p>In New York, Miriam Cherry grows the earliest <strong>blooming</strong> flowers. They bloom as early as February.</p>
<p>“That's going to be a sign to me that this isn't going to last forever,” Cherry said. “It will get better, and spring is on the way.”</p>

            <title>Farmers Aim to Save Mexico City’s Island Gardens (2024/11/12)</title>

<p>Several large lakes once surrounded Mexico City. Those lakes have disappeared over the years. But what is left of one of them is still important to local people who grow food.</p>
<p>Cassandra Gardu<i></i>241;o works in her family's chinampa. In Mexico, a chinampa is an island that was built up by the native Aztec people with fertile mud from the bottom of lakes that surrounded their capital.</p>
<p>One of the areas is called Xochimilco. The islands there are held together by a kind of willow tree planted around their edges. Narrow waterways connect them.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Small ancestral floating gardens are visible next to new soccer fields on the Xochimilco Lake, Mexico City, on Sunday, Oct. 20, 2024.

</span></div>
<p>Xochimilco has more than 1000 hectares of protected land owned by generations of local Chinamperos, as those who farm on the islands are known. Food grown on these islands has fed people for hundreds of years, but the chinampas are under threat from modern ways of life.</p>
<p>Growing food on the chinampas does not make much money. Many families are giving up the old ways to <strong>rent out</strong> or sell their land. They have found it easier and more profitable to use the land for soccer fields and <strong>tourism</strong>.</p>
<p>"People don't want to farm anymore, and people don't want to buy the products." said Gardu<i></i>241;o.</p>
<p>Some of those who stay, like Gardu<i></i>241;o, are working together to save and support the traditional use of the chinampas.</p>
<p>Gardu<i></i>241;o remembers seeing her grandparents' chinampas as a child. Even then, she saw how the chinampas were suffering under pressure from modern life. Some farmers had already given up.</p>
<p>Gardu<i></i>241;o bought land for her own chinampa in 2020. She grows several crops, including sunflowers, eggplant, and the Mexican marigold. She is a member of the growing collective called Chinampa Refuge. The National Autonomous University of Mexico started the collective.</p>
<p>With other farmers in the group, she has asked other Chinamperos to preserve their land. They follow old ways of growing. But they also are trying new <strong>commercial</strong> methods to compete with low-cost goods grown on big farms in Mexico.</p>
<p>Their products include a special <strong>tag</strong> — Etiqueta Chinampera — that tells buyers the produce came from a chinampa. The tag also might bring attention to the area's water quality or the chinampa's <strong>status</strong> as a biodiversity refuge.</p>
<p>"Change comes with educating the new generations," said Gardu<i></i>241;o. "Talking about the <strong>origins</strong> and efforts to <strong>conserve</strong> and why it's important to do it."</p>
<p>Luis Zambrano is a scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has worked in Xochimilco for many years. He said the fields can mostly support themselves. Fed and watered by the lake, they can produce three to five crops of vegetables a year without the need of chemicals or <strong>irrigation</strong>, he said.</p>
<p>Xochimilco's natural resources help the city in several ways. Many kinds of birds and fish live there. The system of waterways helps reduce the city's overall temperature, Zambrano said.</p>
<p>But now, on weekends, it is common to see more soccer players boating to islands than farmers <strong>tending</strong> their crops. Over the past two or three years, Zambrano said, there has been a “massive increase” in the number of soccer fields on the islands. There are also food stands and boat trips for visitors.</p>
<p>"If you do well (farming) you could earn $5,000 to $10,000 a year," Gardu<i></i>241;o said. "In the tourist area you could have that within a couple of weekends."</p>
<p>Zambrano said the soccer fields damage the environment “because the amount of chemicals that are used, the amount of pollution that is generated is very, very large."</p>
<p>Carlos Vasquez, director of the Natural Protected Areas under Mexico City's Environmental Department, said his group is working on ways to limit the damage by the soccer fields.</p>
<p>Sixty-three-year-old Juan <i></i>193;valos and his brother Salvador Gonzalez <i></i>193;valos, who is 55, have been working on chinampas all their lives. Salvador said they want to pass their farming methods on to their grandchildren.</p>
<p>"That's something we need to work on as grandparents," he said. "That they <strong>integrate</strong> themselves with a taste for this earth."</p>

<p>New research suggests Saturn's moon Titan has a thick ice cover that could be warming lower areas and supporting molecular growth.</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Hawaii carried out the new <a class="wsw__a" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ad7018" target="_blank">study</a>. It appears in <em>The Planetary Science Journal</em>. The findings add to existing evidence that Titan may hold the right mix of materials to support possible life.</p>
<p>No life forms have been confirmed on Titan, a cold, icy world. But past studies suggest the moon now has a large <strong>layer</strong> of ice that once supported widely flowing water on the surface. Titan is also thought to contain a dense atmosphere rich in nitrogen and methane, both of which are found in Earth's own atmosphere.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Titan, Saturn's largest moon appears before the planet as it undergoes seasonal changes in this natural color view from NASA's Cassini spacecraft in this handout released by NASA August 29, 2012.

(REUTERS/ NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI)</span></div>
<p>NASA reports Saturn has a total of 146 moons orbiting it, more than any other planet. Titan, an ice giant, is the largest of them.</p>
<p>For more than 10 years, NASA's Cassini spacecraft studied Saturn “and its complex system of rings and moons,” the space agency <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/">said</a>. The new study used NASA data to closely examine surface details of Titan.</p>
<p>The researchers used computer modeling to examine different elements of Titan's surface. One of the main discoveries was that many <strong>craters</strong> examined on Titan's surface were not as deep as some other moons. The team reported that in some cases, craters were hundreds of meters shallower, or less deep, than scientists expected. In addition, only 90 craters were identified on the whole moon.</p>
<p>“This was very surprising because, based on other moons, we expect to see many more <strong>impact</strong> craters on the surface,” said University of Hawaii's Lauren Schurmeier, who led the study.</p>
<p>She said the research team had also expected to see much deeper craters. “We realized something <strong>unique</strong> to Titan must be making them become shallower and disappear relatively quickly,” she said.</p>
<p>Computer modeling carried out by the researchers showed how the surface might have changed to remove signs of major impact craters. The researchers said one of the most likely causes of such change was that the moon's icy surface is covered with a thick layer of solid water ice, with methane gas trapped inside.</p>
<p>The team said the data examinations suggest Titan has a methane-filled icy <strong>crust</strong> that is from five to 10 kilometers thick. The modeling operations run by the scientists produced images that looked similar to crater formations on Titan's surface.</p>
<p>Schurmeier said the methane crust, “warms Titan's interior” and can cause surprisingly fast changes to the surface structure. Schurmeier noted, for example, that crater shallowing on Titan is believed to be happening at a rate “that is close to that of fast-moving warm <strong>glaciers</strong> on Earth.”</p>
<p>The surface of Titan is estimated to be about minus 179 degrees Celsius. Because of this extreme cold, liquids on the moon's surface take the form of ice, with methane gas locked inside, the researchers said. This gas could help warm surface levels beneath, possibly permitting molecules to rise toward the surface.</p>
<p>Schurmeier said studying the thickness of Titan's icy crust is important because it might help explain how the moon's atmosphere began to develop. The measurements could also provide additional information on Titan's changing climate.</p>
<p>“Titan is a natural laboratory to study how the greenhouse gas methane warms and cycles through the atmosphere,” she said. The resulting information, she added, can provide important insights about such processes happening on Earth.</p>
<p>NASA's <a class="wsw__a" href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/about-the-mission/">Cassini</a> spacecraft ended it mission in 2017, when it crashed into Saturn's atmosphere. But the U.S. space agency has plans to send another explorer to Titan in 2028. That mission calls for a spacecraft called Dragonfly to travel to Titan to observe many different areas. The planned explorer, called a rotorcraft, operates similar to a helicopter.</p>

            <title>What Is Veterans Day in the US? (2024/11/11)</title>

<p>World War I officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in France on June 28, 1919.</p>
<p>However, fighting had stopped seven months earlier with an armistice, or an agreement to stop fighting, between the Allied nations and Germany on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.</p>
<p>The date, November 11, is now remembered as Veterans Day, a holiday to thank and honor all who served in the United States military.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - U.S. Army veteran 2nd Lt. Allen Brandstater salutes during a Veterans Day observance in Los Angeles on Nov. 11, 2022. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/1f0d23e0-7a95-4d9b-90b4-0f1839da4858_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - U.S. Army veteran 2nd Lt. Allen Brandstater salutes during a Veterans Day observance in Los Angeles on Nov. 11, 2022. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)</span></div>
<p>The celebration first started on November 11, 1919, as Armistice Day. At the time, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson said the day “will be filled with <strong>solemn</strong> pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with <strong>gratitude</strong> for the victory...” The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs <a class="wsw__a" href="https://department.va.gov/veterans-day/history-of-veterans-day/">says</a> there were plans to observe the day with parades, public meetings, and a brief suspension of business beginning at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>In 1926, the U.S. Congress officially recognized November 11, 1918, as the end of World War I. And in 1938, the body passed legislation to make the 11th of November in each year a legal holiday. Known as “Armistice Day,” it was a day set aside to honor veterans of World War I.</p>
<p>After American involvement in World War II and the Korean War, at the urging of veterans' organizations, Congress changed the law in 1954 to call it Veterans Day to honor American veterans of all wars.</p>
<p>The date for Veterans Day was changed in 1968 with the signing of the Uniform Holiday Act. With the law, Congress intended to create a three-day weekend for Americans by moving the holiday to a Monday in November. Many states and veterans' organizations did not agree with this decision. They continued to celebrate the holiday on November 11, leading to confusion. So, Congress returned the holiday to its <strong>original </strong>date.</p>
<p>Many Americans are confused about Veterans Day and Memorial Day, the other holiday honoring military service, which is observed on the last Monday in May.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says that both holidays “were established to recognize and honor the men and women who have worn the uniform of the United States Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Memorial Day is set aside as a day for remembering and honoring those who died in the service of their country. For most Americans, it also marks the unofficial start of summer and a popular weekend for vacationing.</p>
<p>Veterans Day is largely <strong>intended</strong> to thank and honor all those who served honorably in the military, living or dead, and in wartime or peace.</p>
<p>To ensure that people remember Veterans Day, the U.S. Congress passed, and President Barack Obama signed the Veterans Day Moment of Silence Act in 2016. The law called on the people of the United States to observe a two-minute national moment of silence on Veterans Day at 2:11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time across all states and territories of the United States.</p>

            <title>Late Snow on Japan’s Mount Fuji Sets a Record (2024/11/11)</title>

<p>A national <strong>symbol</strong> of Japan, the respected Mount Fuji usually has a <strong>cap</strong> of snow by early October. This year, weather experts said snowfall on the top of the mountain took place later than it has since records have been kept.</p>
<p>Last year, snow covered the top of the mountain on October 5. But this year, the first snowfall was on November 6, making this year's snowcap the latest to form since 1894 when records started.</p>
<p>The Kofu weather station declares the news every year. Officials at the Kofu observatory confirmed snow near the 3,776-meter top of the country's tallest volcano.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Peak of Mount Fuji showing snow as seen from Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.

</span></div>
<p>The office explained that the "first snowfall" on Mount Fuji is the point when the observatory <strong>staff</strong> can see that all or part of the mountain is covered with snow for the first time after summer.</p>
<p>Mamoru Matsumoto is an official of the Kofu observatory office. He said that Mount Fuji's first snowfall has been delayed in recent years although the reasons are still unclear.</p>
<p>"I feel <strong>relieved</strong> to finally see the snow," he added.</p>
<p>"The temperature at the Fuji summit has been high since October, so I could foresee quite a big delay in the snowfall, which was giving me an uneasy feeling."</p>
<p>Unusually warm weather prevented rainfall from turning to snow this October. The average temperature on the mountain's <strong>peak</strong> reached a record of 1.6 degrees Celsius compared to the October average of -2 degrees Celsius, official data showed.</p>
<p>Maria Gabriel, a visitor from Texas, came to Japan with plans to see the sacred mountain. She told Reuters, "It's beautiful with the snow, and that was kind of what our expectations were coming (to Japan)," she said, adding that the mountain's snowcapped image was famous worldwide.</p>

            <title>Britain Reports Four New Mpox Cases (2024/11/10)</title>

<p>British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, highly infectious version of mpox that first appeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>The announcement marks the first time the <strong>variant</strong> has caused a group of illnesses outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low.</p>
<p>Officials announced the first case of the new form of mpox in Britain last week. Officials said the person who was being treated at a London hospital had recently travelled to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This colorized electron microscope image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 2024 shows Mpox virus particles, green, found within infected cultured cells, blue.

(NIAID via AP, File)</span></div>
<p>This week, the British Health Security Agency said it had now identified three additional cases. All of them lived in the same household as the first patient. The new cases are also being treated at a hospital in London.</p>
<p>Susan Hopkins is chief medical advisor of the British Health Security Agency. She said, “Mpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household."</p>
<p>The new variant of mpox was first reported earlier this year in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC. Scientists believe it causes milder <strong>symptoms</strong> that are harder to notice. As a result, it might be easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in the DRC and in other parts of Africa caused the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in August.</p>
<p>Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another version of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that affected more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand.</p>
<p>To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in the DRC.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the WHO said it had given about 900,000 vaccine <strong>doses </strong>to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics.</p>

            <title>Have You Ever Felt the ‘Long Arm of the Law?’ (2024/11/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Laws help to keep society running smoothly. They help to keep things in order.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about <u>law and order</u>, we are talking about how crime should be kept under control and how society should run.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A police car sits outside Ohio City Hall which received a bomb threat on Thursday morning, in Springfield, Ohio, U.S., September 12, 2024. (REUTERS/Julio-Cesar Chavez) " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7ac41c48-13ee-4cc2-a2c6-746562c68856_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A police car sits outside Ohio City Hall which received a bomb threat on Thursday morning, in Springfield, Ohio, U.S., September 12, 2024. (REUTERS/Julio-Cesar Chavez) </span></div>
<p>The term <u>law and order</u> includes how police enforce laws and how the judicial system deals with criminals.</p>
<p><u>Law and order</u> also describes a situation where most people respect and obey laws. They want to feel safe and to have a sense of public order.</p>
<p>Sometimes people use the term to describe a political candidate. For example:</p>
<p><em>If a city has problems with crime, candidates for public office might run a <u>law and order</u> campaign. They promise to put policies in place that reduce crime.</em></p>
<p>Now, when we talk about catching criminals, we can use another expression: <u>the long arm of the law.</u> This describes the ability of police to find and catch people who commit crimes. It further describes the power of law enforcement and the legal system to punish criminals and carry out justice.</p>
<p>So, the <u>long arm of the law</u> is the far-reaching power of police and the legal system. For example:</p>
<p><em>Criminals who are <u>on the run</u> are unlikely to escape the long arm of the law forever. If they make one mistake, they might get caught.</em></p>
<p>Now, let's talk about non-criminals. Sometimes people might do things that they do not know are illegal. For example<strong>,</strong></p>
<p><em>A<strong> prank</strong> or <strong>practical joke</strong> played on a friend might seem harmless. But <u>in the eyes of the law,</u> it might actually be illegal.</em></p>
<p>When we say <u>in the eyes of the law</u>, we mean what a law actually says and how people who enforce the law understand it.</p>
<p>That leads us to another expression: <strong><u>ignorance</u></strong><u> of the law is no excuse</u>. If we are ignorant of something, we don't know about it. However, simply not knowing if an action is illegal doesn't matter in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>The <u>long arm of the law</u> will still reach out and <strong>uphold</strong> the law. Then we might find ourselves <u>on the wrong side of the law</u>. And that's a bad place to be. Being <u>on the wrong side of the law</u> means we have broken a law, or worse, laws.</p>
<p>So, if we want to be <strong>upstanding</strong>, law-<strong>abiding </strong>citizens and avoid the <u>long arm of the law,</u> we should stay on the <u>right side of the law!</u></p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Traditional Seoul Village Hopes Curfew Brings Back Normal Life (2024/11/9)</title>

<p>In South Korea's capital of Seoul, Bukchon Hanok Village's narrow winding alleyways date back hundreds of years to the Joseon <strong>Dynasty</strong>. The area has become a popular place to visit, especially after appearing in a television show about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Foreign visitors and Koreans visit the neighborhood to see houses with wood <strong>columns</strong>, <strong>courtyards</strong> and tiled <strong>roofs</strong>.</p>
<p>The area attracted about 6 million visitors last year while the population of the area is around 6,100.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A large crowd of tourists walks through Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, South Korea, October 25, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon )" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a95baf70-efae-4d60-bac8-b64decaaeb02_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A large crowd of tourists walks through Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, South Korea, October 25, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon )</span></div>
<p>However, increasing numbers of visitors have become a problem for people who live there. They complain about noise, <strong>trash</strong>, bad behavior and invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>Some visitors have been caught on camera trying to enter private homes or looking inside without permission, creating conflict with locals.</p>
<p>Many local people have chosen to leave, leading to a 27.6 percent drop in the village's population over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Village officials now want to set a curfew in the area. The curfew will limit visitors to certain areas of Bukchon from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. local time. It will start as a <strong>trial</strong> in November and will be officially launched next March. Violators could pay fines of up to $72.</p>
<p>Chung Moon-hun is the head of Jongno district. Chung said the goal is to protect the rights of local people. Chung said the curfew can be changed if necessary to make it more effective. The area where curfew hours and fines will be in effect is about 34,000 square meters. That is about the size of five soccer fields.</p>
<p>Kwon Young-doo owns the private Asian Cultural Art Museum in Bukchon Hanok Village. Kwon is concerned about the curfew policy aimed at preventing visitors from overrunning the area.</p>
<p>"Who would want to visit?" asked Kwon who moved into the historic area 18 years ago. "They'll leave with a bad impression of South Korea."</p>
<p>Others do not believe the policy will be effective. They note measures such as <strong>exemptions</strong> for visitors staying overnight in traditional houses called hanok. Many of these hanok are now owned by businesses after officials loosened restrictions on overnight stays.</p>
<p>"People come for just a day to enjoy themselves, and the noise from parties is extremely loud," said Kim Eun-mee, who lives next to a hanok. Clearing trash in front of her home has become a task she has to perform several times a day.</p>
<p>"It's often difficult to maintain a normal daily <strong>routine</strong> due to <strong>disturbances</strong>.” She said people often make noise moving their suitcases around even in the early hours, which wakes her up.</p>
<p>Lee Dong-woo is head of the website BUTLER.LEE which is used to rent the hanoks. Lee said the business grew when owners who found it difficult to modernize or maintain old houses turned them over to businesses.</p>
<p>"These requests are driving the expansion, not because we are actively <strong>evicting</strong> current residents to operate hanok stays," Lee said. Lee oversees 17 hanok stays in Bukchon.</p>
<p>Visitors are divided over the curfew. Some agree locals' quality of life is important. Others are unhappy at the idea of getting fined for simply walking down a public street.</p>
<p>There are also questions about how the rules will be enforced; how to tell visitors from locals; how to make foreigners pay a fine, and how to deal with the language barrier.</p>

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/practice-your-listening.mp3"/>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Zekeriya in Turkiye about listening to English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/0ef7bcc7-67f3-4ce9-be29-39b55cded8d4_w268_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>When I practice listening, I <strong>focus</strong> a lot and do a lot of repetitions. After a while, I realized that I was actually <strong>memorizing</strong> the audio recording instead of practicing listening. How do you think I should do an <strong>ideal</strong> listening exercise?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Zekeriya</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Zekeriya.</p>
<p>There is not one ideal listening exercise. Instead, there are several good ways to improve your listening.</p>
<p>The repetitions you are doing can be necessary and helpful for you to understand what you hear. And repetitions likely help you remember new words and how to pronounce them. But let's look at more ways you can practice listening.</p>
<p><strong>Listening methods</strong></p>
<p>First, try to find listening material that is just a bit above your ability. This will help you learn new words without making it too difficult for you.</p>
<p>It is best to listen to English material that has words written either in <strong>captions</strong> or in the body text, such as a VOA Learning English article. This will help check your listening.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can test yourself by first listening to parts of the audio without reading the words.</li>
<li>Note the main ideas and the things you clearly understood.</li>
<li>Then, listen to it again and try to understand more details. This is when you can do shorter repetitions.</li>
<li>Next, you can check how much you understood by reading the words as you listen to the audio again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transcribing</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to practice listening is by writing every word you hear. This is called transcribing. Even with audio examples as short as one minute, you can learn a lot of English using this method. For example, if you are transcribing an <strong>interview</strong>, you might notice differences between spoken English and written English.</p>
<p>By transcribing, you can notice and learn new expressions, grammar rules and spelling. This method also helps make new words stay in your memory when you read them. That is because you are discovering the answer to a problem you have already tried to solve through listening.</p>
<p><strong>Other tips</strong></p>
<p>Try listening to English spoken at different speeds. Over time, you can follow spoken English at a faster speed. Many videos online let you increase or decrease the speed of playback.</p>
<p>Practice listening to English spoken in different foreign <strong>accents</strong>. This is a useful skill because English is spoken in so many places around the world.</p>
<p>Center your listening on specific sounds or grammatical points. For example, preposition use in English can be difficult. Try listening for prepositions and the words they connect with. This can help you use them correctly in your speaking and writing.</p>
<p>Remember that, like any skill, you can improve listening by practicing often and having detailed plans for the methods you will use.</p>

<p>Researchers in Mexico have discovered a large, lost Mayan city.</p>
<p>The major <strong>urban</strong> settlement, named Valeriana, is hidden deep in the southern forest of Campeche.</p>
<p>The discovery adds to existing knowledge about ancient Mayan settlements.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Lidar image shows what archeologists say is a newly discovered Mayan city in the jungle of Campeche, Mexico.

Handout released October 29, 2024. (Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications Ltd/Handout via REUTERS) </span></div>
<p>Valeriana was discovered by chance thanks to Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging. It is a technology that uses lasers to map the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>The data used for the study came from around 122 square kilometers of high-quality Lidar data collected in 2013.</p>
<p>The work, led by the Nature Conservancy in Mexico, was part of a forest <strong>monitoring</strong> project called Alianza. The project aimed to reduce emissions from tree cutting, or deforestation, and land damage.</p>
<p>Researchers wrote in the study, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/running-out-of-empty-space-environmental-lidar-and-the-crowded-ancient-landscape-of-campeche-mexico/FFDB435047017853F26CFC5D8804B08D" target="_blank">published by Cambridge University Press,</a> that "The discovery of Valeriana <strong>highlights</strong> the fact that there are still major gaps in our knowledge of the existence or absence of large sites within as-yet unmapped areas of the Maya Lowlands.”</p>
<p>Lidar technology revealed a major settlement, filled with buildings and agricultural <strong>infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<p>The classical-era Maya civilization dates back to around 1800 to 1100 years ago. At the time, the Maya civilization grew its control over present-day southern Mexico and what are now Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>In the study, the researchers identified a total of 6,764 structures, suggesting a populous ancient city.</p>
<p>The researchers will carry out further detailed study of the dataset – both remotely and in the field. The discovery serves as a way to better understand ancient Mayan urbanization and settlements.</p>
