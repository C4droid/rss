        <description>美国之音（以下称VOA）的英语节目，按播音速度可分为两种：Standard English （标准英语）和 Special English（特别英语）。

Special English 又叫“慢速英语”，是VOA 专为全世界非英语国家初学英语的听众安排的一种简易、规范的英语广播节目。该节目创始于50年代末期，是VOA 的专家们研究如何与世界各地的英语学习者进行交际的产物。它正式开播于1959年10月。当时只面向欧洲和中东，但由于这个节目适合许多国家英语学习者的需要，所以它的广播对象不久就扩大到世界其他地区，并很快在全世界范围内产生了广泛的影响。现在这个节目对欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲每晚广播一次，对加勒比地区每晚广播一次（星期天除外），对东南亚广播次数最多，每天上午两次，晚上三次。

30多年来，VOA 为了办好Special English节目，进行了大量的调查研究工作，对播音速度、内容及用词范围都作了具体规定，基本上达到了既能为英语学习者提供信息，又不损害英语本身风格的目的，使之成为VOA 独具特色，拥有最大量听众的节目。

美国著名词汇学家S. B. Flexmer 指明了Special English的三条标准，也就是它所“特别”的地方：

1、它是一种由美国人最常用的1500个基本单词为主体构成的美国英语；

2、它用简短、明晰的句子写作和广播；

3、它以每分钟90个单词的速度，即2/3的Standard English（标准英语）速度进行广播。

Special English的节目可分为两大类：一类是新闻节目；一类是专题节目。

1．新闻节目

VOA Special English 的新闻广播向听众提供世界范围内的政治、经济、军事、外交、国际关系、宗教、天气以及各种重大事件和珍闻奇事等各个方面的信息，每天向东南亚地区广播五次，早上两次，晚上三次，每逢半点播出。

Special English新闻节目每次长约十分钟，大都播出十条左右新闻，近一千个单词，每条新闻多为一分钟，但偶尔也有长达两分钟的要闻。除头条新闻外，每条新闻都由一个电头引导，这样显得结构分明，条理清晰，适宜初学英语的人收听。在节目结束之前，播音员常常用三四句话重播其中三条新闻的提要以加深听众对要闻的印象。

Special English新闻中70%左右的内容与同时整点播出的Standard English新闻相同，但相同新闻的先后次序有所变动。每次节目的开头和结尾大同小异，格式比较固定。

2．专题节目（一）

Special English的专题节目（Feature Programs）,从时间上看，可分为两大类：一是每五分钟一次的专题，二是每十五分钟一次的专题。本节先介绍每项五分钟一次的专题材节目。

Special English五分钟一次的专题材节目安排在Special English新闻节目之后和（或）每十五分钟一次的专题材节目之前播出，每星期播七次。根据内容，可分为三个小类，即：Science Report（科学报道），逢星期一、三、五播出，每天播六遍；Agriculture Report（农业报道），逢星期二、四播出，每天播六遍；Words And Their Stories（词语掌故），逢星期六和星期天播出，每天播五遍。这三个专题材各具特色，具有相对的独立性，听众每听完一个节目，都会获得一个完整的印象。

Science Report（科学报道）这一专题材节目每周向听众介绍三篇有关现代科学技术最新发展情况的报道，涉及物理、化学、天文至高无上理、生物、环卫、心理、教育、医学和计算机等方面。适宜理工科大学生和科技工作者收集信息，积累资料，学习科技英语。

Agriculture Report（农业报道） Agriculture Report是为农业科技工作者和生产者安排的一个专题。它专门报道世界各国，特别是美国现代农业生产的最新成文汇报总务科 学家对农业生产某一方面的研究进展，以及他们对影响农业生产的某一自然现象进行分析和研究的近况。此外，它还经常向听众介绍发展中国家家业生产的一些有益经验等内容。

Words And Their Stories（词语掌故）这一专题节目，旨在向学习英语的听众介绍美国英语中生动有趣的词语和惯用法，并从科学研究和通俗词源学的角度来解释它们的含意、产生的背景及其在使用过程中的演变情况等。它通过讲故事的形式讲解每一个词语。这是VOA Special English中的优秀节目之一，是学习美国英语的极好材料。通过收听这一节目，听众不仅能学到娓娓动听的掌故和地道的美国英语，而且能增加美国的社会文化背景知识，历史传统与现状的了解。

VOA 为了更好地办好这个节目，便于听众收听学习，于1978年编辑出版了一本名为Words And Their Stories的书，共收集一百篇故事，作者是Herbert Sutcliffe, Harold Bermen 及VOA 该节目的部分编辑人员。在每次的实际广播中，播音员都以此书为蓝本，再根据需要对原稿进行适当增删。按每周两个故事计算，此书的一百个故事还不能满足一年的播音需要。于是编辑们就是重播部分词语掌故的同时，不断增加许多新的词语掌故，及时将词源学家的最新研究成果和不断增加的新词汇介绍给听众。收听实践证明，初学者在收听过程中必然会遇到许多人名、地名和一些较难的句子，有时甚至在听完之后还很难理解所播词语的确切含义及其汉语意思，为此，听众可参看1983年由中国对外翻译出版公司出版的该书英汉对照本中的有关部分。

3．专题节目（二）

VOA Special English的专题节目，除上节谈的五分钟一次的以外，还有本节要介绍的每十五分钟一次的节目。这类节目共有七个不同的小专题，以星期为单位循环，每天分四次复播出一个专题，但星期日和星期六的两个专题材每晚只播三遍，每次节目约十分钟，继每次五分钟的专题节目之后播出。

这类专题节目的基本结构是，在特定的伴声中先报告当次节目的名称，并扼要介绍其主要内容，然后播送节目正文。最后，在伴乐声中报告节目主持人和撰稿人的姓名，以邀请听众在下周的这个时间继续收听该节目而结束。

People in America（美国人物志） 这是有关美国历史名人的一个专题节目，每逢星期天晚上播出。它向听众介绍在美国历史上产生过重大影响、起过重要作用、作出了突出贡献的科学、文学、政治、或其他各方面的历史人物。节目一般都对他们的生平事迹进行简要的叙述，对其贡献作出评介，类似人物小传。有的重要人物事迹很多，必须用两次或几次的节目时间进行联播。对这样的节目要坚持收听，才会获得完整的印象。

TThis is America（今日美国） This Is America向听众介绍美国人民的生活、学习、工作和娱乐情况，是英语学习者解美国社会的一条渠道。该专题大都一个节目一个整体，每逢星期一晚播出。

Science in the News（科学新闻） 这一专题材主要对新近的科学技术新闻进行综述或摘要广播。向听众介绍世界各国在自然、医学、疾病、原子能、航天等方面的科研动态、成果、突破性进展及存在的困难。涉及当今世界人们普遍关心的重大问题，如核事故、航天飞机爆炸、自然灾害、环境污染和爱滋病等等。每逢星期二播出，每次播一到五条新闻摘要。

Explorations（自然探索） 每逢星期三晚上，听众可以收听到Explorations这一专题节目。该专题既涉及人类遨游太空、探索原子、研究自身、改造自然的现代技术，也报道发展中国家开发新资源，利用新工艺改善人民生活等方面的成就，其侧重点在各种科技实验和简易实用技术方面。该节目一般安排一段时间播一个系列，每次播出一个主题，以便能将某项新技术的研究和应用的全过程介绍给听众，电台还乐意为感兴趣的听众提供所需的文字材料。

The Making of a Nation（建国史话） 这一专题节目向听众介绍美利坚合众国从十三个殖民地区域到现代工业国的孕育、诞生以及形成超级大国的历史过程，并以历史为线索，特定的历史时期为单位，以重大的历史事件为主题材来叙述各个党派、各届总统和政府的历史作用与贡献。这是每个英语学习者都应了解的基本知识。The Making of a Nation每逢星期四播出。这是个系列节目，坚持收听，则有助于系统了解美国的历史概况。

American Mosaic（美国万花筒） American Mosaic是一个radio magazine（广播杂志）节目。该节目题材广泛、内容丰，展示着美国社会文化生活中比较轻松愉快的生活画面；听众收听该节目就如同在阅读一本图文并茂的杂志。它每次有三到五个小节目，涉及音乐、图书、技术和教育等方面的内容。我们既可以从中欣赏到著名歌唱的优秀歌曲，对美国音乐有所了解，又可以获取一些生动有趣的现代美国社会生活知识，随着播音员那亲切悦耳的声音步入美国风景如画的大好河山；同时还能听到世界各地的听众提出的有关英语语方文学等方面的问题和电台的解答。

American Stories（美国故事） 这一专题材节目安排在每星期六晚上播出。这样能使听众在学习和工作之余，得以轻松一下头脑。我们可以通过这一美国文学的“窗口”，接触各种流派、各类名家的文学作品。了解美国英语的时代特色，欣赏、学习美国人民运用语方的技巧，并从那些佳作名篇中获得艺术享受。该节目对短篇故事采取一次播一篇的方式，对中、长篇小说则先进行简写加工，再分几次播出全文。在播出故事正文之前，播音员常常先介绍故事的主要情节。对需要分几次节目时间播出的中长篇，在播第二或以后各部分之前，主持人还先重述已播部分的故事梗概，以唤起听众的回忆，使故事听起来更加连贯。</description>

            <title>Britain Reports Four New Mpox Cases (2024/11/10)</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By John Russell</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>British health officials say they have identified four cases of the new, highly infectious version of mpox that first appeared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>The announcement marks the first time the <strong>variant</strong> has caused a group of illnesses outside of Africa. Scientists said the risk to the public remains low.</p>
<p>Officials announced the first case of the new form of mpox in Britain last week. Officials said the person who was being treated at a London hospital had recently travelled to countries in Africa with ongoing outbreaks.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This colorized electron microscope image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 2024 shows Mpox virus particles, green, found within infected cultured cells, blue. (NIAID via AP, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/17f3e9f4-73a1-4444-a078-41b8bd8e53af_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This colorized electron microscope image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 2024 shows Mpox virus particles, green, found within infected cultured cells, blue. (NIAID via AP, File)</span></div>
<p>This week, the British Health Security Agency said it had now identified three additional cases. All of them lived in the same household as the first patient. The new cases are also being treated at a hospital in London.</p>
<p>Susan Hopkins is chief medical advisor of the British Health Security Agency. She said, “Mpox is very infectious in households with close contact and so it is not unexpected to see further cases within the same household."</p>
<p>The new variant of mpox was first reported earlier this year in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC. Scientists believe it causes milder <strong>symptoms</strong> that are harder to notice. As a result, it might be easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in the DRC and in other parts of Africa caused the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in August.</p>
<p>Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another version of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that affected more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>The new variant of mpox has also caused outbreaks in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Single cases in travelers have also been reported in Sweden, India, Germany and Thailand.</p>
<p>To date, there have been about 43,000 suspect cases of mpox in Africa, including more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in the DRC.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the WHO said it had given about 900,000 vaccine <strong>doses </strong>to nine African countries struggling with mpox epidemics.</p>

            <title>Have You Ever Felt the ‘Long Arm of the Law?’ (2024/11/10)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/have-you-ever-felt-the-long-arm-of-the-law.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">09 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Laws help to keep society running smoothly. They help to keep things in order.</p>
<p>So, when we talk about <u>law and order</u>, we are talking about how crime should be kept under control and how society should run.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A police car sits outside Ohio City Hall which received a bomb threat on Thursday morning, in Springfield, Ohio, U.S., September 12, 2024. (REUTERS/Julio-Cesar Chavez) " src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7ac41c48-13ee-4cc2-a2c6-746562c68856_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A police car sits outside Ohio City Hall which received a bomb threat on Thursday morning, in Springfield, Ohio, U.S., September 12, 2024. (REUTERS/Julio-Cesar Chavez) </span></div>
<p>The term <u>law and order</u> includes how police enforce laws and how the judicial system deals with criminals.</p>
<p><u>Law and order</u> also describes a situation where most people respect and obey laws. They want to feel safe and to have a sense of public order.</p>
<p>Sometimes people use the term to describe a political candidate. For example:</p>
<p><em>If a city has problems with crime, candidates for public office might run a <u>law and order</u> campaign. They promise to put policies in place that reduce crime.</em></p>
<p>Now, when we talk about catching criminals, we can use another expression: <u>the long arm of the law.</u> This describes the ability of police to find and catch people who commit crimes. It further describes the power of law enforcement and the legal system to punish criminals and carry out justice.</p>
<p>So, the <u>long arm of the law</u> is the far-reaching power of police and the legal system. For example:</p>
<p><em>Criminals who are <u>on the run</u> are unlikely to escape the long arm of the law forever. If they make one mistake, they might get caught.</em></p>
<p>Now, let's talk about non-criminals. Sometimes people might do things that they do not know are illegal. For example<strong>,</strong></p>
<p><em>A<strong> prank</strong> or <strong>practical joke</strong> played on a friend might seem harmless. But <u>in the eyes of the law,</u> it might actually be illegal.</em></p>
<p>When we say <u>in the eyes of the law</u>, we mean what a law actually says and how people who enforce the law understand it.</p>
<p>That leads us to another expression: <strong><u>ignorance</u></strong><u> of the law is no excuse</u>. If we are ignorant of something, we don't know about it. However, simply not knowing if an action is illegal doesn't matter in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>The <u>long arm of the law</u> will still reach out and <strong>uphold</strong> the law. Then we might find ourselves <u>on the wrong side of the law</u>. And that's a bad place to be. Being <u>on the wrong side of the law</u> means we have broken a law, or worse, laws.</p>
<p>So, if we want to be <strong>upstanding</strong>, law-<strong>abiding </strong>citizens and avoid the <u>long arm of the law,</u> we should stay on the <u>right side of the law!</u></p>
<p>And that's the end of this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

            <title>Traditional Seoul Village Hopes Curfew Brings Back Normal Life (2024/11/9)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>In South Korea's capital of Seoul, Bukchon Hanok Village's narrow winding alleyways date back hundreds of years to the Joseon <strong>Dynasty</strong>. The area has become a popular place to visit, especially after appearing in a television show about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Foreign visitors and Koreans visit the neighborhood to see houses with wood <strong>columns</strong>, <strong>courtyards</strong> and tiled <strong>roofs</strong>.</p>
<p>The area attracted about 6 million visitors last year while the population of the area is around 6,100.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A large crowd of tourists walks through Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, South Korea, October 25, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon )" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/a95baf70-efae-4d60-bac8-b64decaaeb02_cx0_cy1_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A large crowd of tourists walks through Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, South Korea, October 25, 2024. (REUTERS/Kim Soo-hyeon )</span></div>
<p>However, increasing numbers of visitors have become a problem for people who live there. They complain about noise, <strong>trash</strong>, bad behavior and invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>Some visitors have been caught on camera trying to enter private homes or looking inside without permission, creating conflict with locals.</p>
<p>Many local people have chosen to leave, leading to a 27.6 percent drop in the village's population over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Village officials now want to set a curfew in the area. The curfew will limit visitors to certain areas of Bukchon from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. local time. It will start as a <strong>trial</strong> in November and will be officially launched next March. Violators could pay fines of up to $72.</p>
<p>Chung Moon-hun is the head of Jongno district. Chung said the goal is to protect the rights of local people. Chung said the curfew can be changed if necessary to make it more effective. The area where curfew hours and fines will be in effect is about 34,000 square meters. That is about the size of five soccer fields.</p>
<p>Kwon Young-doo owns the private Asian Cultural Art Museum in Bukchon Hanok Village. Kwon is concerned about the curfew policy aimed at preventing visitors from overrunning the area.</p>
<p>"Who would want to visit?" asked Kwon who moved into the historic area 18 years ago. "They'll leave with a bad impression of South Korea."</p>
<p>Others do not believe the policy will be effective. They note measures such as <strong>exemptions</strong> for visitors staying overnight in traditional houses called hanok. Many of these hanok are now owned by businesses after officials loosened restrictions on overnight stays.</p>
<p>"People come for just a day to enjoy themselves, and the noise from parties is extremely loud," said Kim Eun-mee, who lives next to a hanok. Clearing trash in front of her home has become a task she has to perform several times a day.</p>
<p>"It's often difficult to maintain a normal daily <strong>routine</strong> due to <strong>disturbances</strong>.” She said people often make noise moving their suitcases around even in the early hours, which wakes her up.</p>
<p>Lee Dong-woo is head of the website BUTLER.LEE which is used to rent the hanoks. Lee said the business grew when owners who found it difficult to modernize or maintain old houses turned them over to businesses.</p>
<p>"These requests are driving the expansion, not because we are actively <strong>evicting</strong> current residents to operate hanok stays," Lee said. Lee oversees 17 hanok stays in Bukchon.</p>
<p>Visitors are divided over the curfew. Some agree locals' quality of life is important. Others are unhappy at the idea of getting fined for simply walking down a public street.</p>
<p>There are also questions about how the rules will be enforced; how to tell visitors from locals; how to make foreigners pay a fine, and how to deal with the language barrier.</p>

            <title>Practice Your Listening (2024/11/9)</title>

            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/practice-your-listening.mp3"/>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Zekeriya in Turkiye about listening to English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/0ef7bcc7-67f3-4ce9-be29-39b55cded8d4_w268_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>When I practice listening, I <strong>focus</strong> a lot and do a lot of repetitions. After a while, I realized that I was actually <strong>memorizing</strong> the audio recording instead of practicing listening. How do you think I should do an <strong>ideal</strong> listening exercise?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Zekeriya</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Zekeriya.</p>
<p>There is not one ideal listening exercise. Instead, there are several good ways to improve your listening.</p>
<p>The repetitions you are doing can be necessary and helpful for you to understand what you hear. And repetitions likely help you remember new words and how to pronounce them. But let's look at more ways you can practice listening.</p>
<p><strong>Listening methods</strong></p>
<p>First, try to find listening material that is just a bit above your ability. This will help you learn new words without making it too difficult for you.</p>
<p>It is best to listen to English material that has words written either in <strong>captions</strong> or in the body text, such as a VOA Learning English article. This will help check your listening.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can test yourself by first listening to parts of the audio without reading the words.</li>
<li>Note the main ideas and the things you clearly understood.</li>
<li>Then, listen to it again and try to understand more details. This is when you can do shorter repetitions.</li>
<li>Next, you can check how much you understood by reading the words as you listen to the audio again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transcribing</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to practice listening is by writing every word you hear. This is called transcribing. Even with audio examples as short as one minute, you can learn a lot of English using this method. For example, if you are transcribing an <strong>interview</strong>, you might notice differences between spoken English and written English.</p>
<p>By transcribing, you can notice and learn new expressions, grammar rules and spelling. This method also helps make new words stay in your memory when you read them. That is because you are discovering the answer to a problem you have already tried to solve through listening.</p>
<p><strong>Other tips</strong></p>
<p>Try listening to English spoken at different speeds. Over time, you can follow spoken English at a faster speed. Many videos online let you increase or decrease the speed of playback.</p>
<p>Practice listening to English spoken in different foreign <strong>accents</strong>. This is a useful skill because English is spoken in so many places around the world.</p>
<p>Center your listening on specific sounds or grammatical points. For example, preposition use in English can be difficult. Try listening for prepositions and the words they connect with. This can help you use them correctly in your speaking and writing.</p>
<p>Remember that, like any skill, you can improve listening by practicing often and having detailed plans for the methods you will use.</p>

<p>Researchers in Mexico have discovered a large, lost Mayan city.</p>
<p>The major <strong>urban</strong> settlement, named Valeriana, is hidden deep in the southern forest of Campeche.</p>
<p>The discovery adds to existing knowledge about ancient Mayan settlements.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A Lidar image shows what archeologists say is a newly discovered Mayan city in the jungle of Campeche, Mexico.

Handout released October 29, 2024. (Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications Ltd/Handout via REUTERS) </span></div>
<p>Valeriana was discovered by chance thanks to Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging. It is a technology that uses lasers to map the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>The data used for the study came from around 122 square kilometers of high-quality Lidar data collected in 2013.</p>
<p>The work, led by the Nature Conservancy in Mexico, was part of a forest <strong>monitoring</strong> project called Alianza. The project aimed to reduce emissions from tree cutting, or deforestation, and land damage.</p>
<p>Researchers wrote in the study, <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/running-out-of-empty-space-environmental-lidar-and-the-crowded-ancient-landscape-of-campeche-mexico/FFDB435047017853F26CFC5D8804B08D" target="_blank">published by Cambridge University Press,</a> that "The discovery of Valeriana <strong>highlights</strong> the fact that there are still major gaps in our knowledge of the existence or absence of large sites within as-yet unmapped areas of the Maya Lowlands.”</p>
<p>Lidar technology revealed a major settlement, filled with buildings and agricultural <strong>infrastructure</strong>.</p>
<p>The classical-era Maya civilization dates back to around 1800 to 1100 years ago. At the time, the Maya civilization grew its control over present-day southern Mexico and what are now Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
<p>In the study, the researchers identified a total of 6,764 structures, suggesting a populous ancient city.</p>
<p>The researchers will carry out further detailed study of the dataset – both remotely and in the field. The discovery serves as a way to better understand ancient Mayan urbanization and settlements.</p>

            <title>Europe’s Space Agency Is in Talks with SpaceX to Cut Space Junk (2024/11/8)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is reportedly in talks with America's SpaceX to cooperate in efforts to reduce the growing amount of space <strong>junk</strong>.</p>
<p>The talks, reported by Reuters news agency, aim to get the California-based space company to join an international agreement that pushes for policies to fight space <strong>debris</strong>. It has been estimated that SpaceX satellites represent about two-thirds of spacecraft currently in low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Space debris is anything that humans have put into space that is no longer in use. This could include satellites, equipment, parts of rockets or spacecraft.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is launched, carrying 23 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., May 6, 2024. (REUTERS/Joe Skipper/File Photo)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8b68390c-9001-4833-a446-00cd973c5f20_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is launched, carrying 23 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., May 6, 2024.

<p>Space junk orbits hundreds of kilometers above Earth. It can circle Earth at speeds of about 25,000 kilometers per hour in low-Earth orbit. And it can cause major damage if it hits a space station, satellite or spacecraft.</p>
<p>The International agreement that ESA wants SpaceX to join is called the Zero Debris Charter. It seeks to stop any new orbital junk from being created by 2030. The 22 members of ESA have been seeking new members to join the agreement since the agency announced it in 2023.</p>
<p>ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher told Reuters that more than 100 countries and organizations have so far joined the agreement. When asked about SpaceX's possible involvement, Aschbacher said ESA was “in discussion” with the company to possibly sign up.</p>
<p>Aschbacher did not provide further details. But he said that work on the charter is moving forward, and ESA is continually raising the issue of space junk with nations and organizations.</p>
<p>Reuters reported that SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment on the matter. The news agency said that out of about 10,300 active satellites in space, an estimated 6,300 are part of SpaceX's fast-growing Starlink internet service system. Reuters said that information came from the U.S. Space Force.</p>
<p>Other organizations and nations are also launching their own large satellite collections. China has done so in an attempt to compete with SpaceX, Reuters reported. In addition, American-based Amazon expects to launch more than 3,000 satellites for its Kuiper internet service over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Jonathan McDowell is a Harvard University astronomer who follows such objects. He has estimated there are nearly 19,000 pieces of trackable space junk in orbit.</p>
<p>McDowell said he thinks it is important to have members of industry publicly support this kind of charter. "So, I'm glad to know SpaceX is considering it," he said.</p>
<p>There are no international laws on space debris. But in recent years countries have begun to create plans and national rules for fighting the problem.</p>
<p>"We are not a <strong>regulatory</strong> body; we are a technical space agency," Aschbacher said. "But the fact that we have put the charter around the table, which was <strong>elaborated</strong> with all the other partners, and that they signed up to it is very encouraging," he added.</p>

            <title>US Approves Apple AirPods to Be Used as Hearing Aids (2024/11/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202411/us-approves-apple-airpods-to-be-used-as-hearing-aids.mp3"/>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">06 November, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The American government has approved the use of Apple AirPods as hearing aids.</p>
<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software">announced</a> it had approved new hearing aid software created for some AirPods devices. An Apple software release this week launched the system on the devices.</p>
<p>Apple <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/">said</a> its AirPods Pro 2 are equipped with the software. The company added that the design will permit users to turn their AirPods into a medical-strength hearing aid device.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A pair of Apple AirPods Pro 2 are displayed on a table at Brooklyn College's audiology clinic in New York on Oct. 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/925df86d-5516-4a8a-b44d-b1094805cd10_cx0_cy6_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A pair of Apple AirPods Pro 2 are displayed on a table at Brooklyn College's audiology clinic in New York on Oct. 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Mary Conlon)</span></div>
<p>The system aims to increase <strong>specific</strong> sounds in real-time, including parts of speech and elements within a users' environment. Apple says another goal of its software release is to get more people to try hearing aids.</p>
<p>An estimated 30 million Americans – about 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 12 — have hearing loss in both ears. Millions could see improvements from hearing aids. But most have never tried them, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders says.</p>
<p>Many others have tried assistive devices, but choose not to use them. The reasons include high cost, poor quality, poor fit, how the devices look or other reasons. But in recent years, there has been a push in the U.S. to get more people to try them.</p>
<p>In 2022, federal rules changed to permit some kinds of hearing aids to be sold without a doctor's order, or <strong>prescription</strong>. Such moves aimed to bring better and less costly models to patients.</p>
<p>The highest-quality hearing aids can cost from $1,000 to $2,500, or even more. But some over-the-counter models sell for between $400 and $500, said Elizabeth Stangl, a hearing expert at the University of Iowa. She spoke to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Stangl said some of the less costly models are only effective at raising sound levels. But they lack the personal settings and noise blocking tools that can make hearing aids most helpful. AirPods cost $249 on Apple's website, and sometimes less from other sellers.</p>
<p>The launch of the software is part of a series of health tools Apple has released over the years. Most of them were built for the Apple Watch. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.apple.com/healthcare/apple-watch/">These include</a> several tools for checking heart and oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Apple's software release also includes built-in tests to help users find out if they have hearing loss and, if so, how severe it is. Those who do have hearing loss can then set specific <strong>amplification</strong> levels.</p>
<p>Experts say there are other, similar headphone devices on the market that could also be used to increase sound levels for people with hearing loss. But many agree the AirPods addition is a good one, largely because of the way it could help normalize hearing aids for the public.</p>
<p>Barbara Kelley is the director of the Hearing Loss Association of America. She told the AP that AirPods are considered “<strong>mainstream</strong>” and already widely used. This could get people to try the devices if they have been resistant to the look of traditional hearing aids.</p>
<p>Kelley noted that many health conditions have been linked to hearing loss. These include <strong>depression</strong>, <strong>dementia</strong> and greater risk of falls. The majority of people with hearing loss are over age 60, but it can affect younger people as well, including those who suffered a hearing damaging event.</p>
<p>“Everything we do, all our relationships, whether it's personal or in our work life, involve hearing <strong>conversation</strong>,” Kelley said. “We're finding now that the sooner that people can pay attention to their hearing health, the better.”</p>
<p>The University of Iowa's Stangl noted the AirPods solution does come with possible issues some people may not like. Fit and comfort during long use might be one of these. And while other hearing aids are built to last through a whole day or more, she said the <strong>battery </strong>life of the AirPods does not permit for that. She also said that wearing AirPods might send a message to others that the person does not want to be <strong>disturbed</strong> or spoken to.</p>
<p>“But we're hoping that more people will try it and realize, ‘Yeah, these do help,'” Stangl said.</p>

            <title>Mpox Cases in DRC Might Be Decreasing (2024/11/7)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Some health officials say mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo appear to be “<strong>stabilizing</strong>.” The observation is a possible sign that the <strong>epidemic</strong> might be declining.</p>
<p>Mpox is also known as m<i><i>onkey</i></i>pox. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/index.html">says</a> the viral disease was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a “pox-like” disease appeared in m<i><i>onkey</i></i>s. Until recently, most human cases involved people in central and West Africa who had contact with infected animals.</p>
<p>Last August, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/who-calls-for-donations-after-declaring-mpox-a-health-emergency-/7744040.html">declared mpox</a> in Africa a "public health emergency of international concern.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Emile Miango, 2, who has mpox, lies in a hospital, in Kamituga, South Kivu province, Sept. 4, 2024, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. (AP Photo/Moses Sawasawa, file)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/03e90655-a011-4641-bc58-47c0e7cd3d49_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Emile Miango, 2, who has mpox, lies in a hospital, in Kamituga, South Kivu province, Sept. 4, 2024, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. (AP Photo/Moses Sawasawa, file)</span></div>
<p>In recent weeks, the WHO says the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC, has reported about 200 to 300 confirmed mpox cases every week. That number is down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. A decrease has also been reported in Kamituga, where the new, more infectious <strong>variant</strong> of mpox first appeared.</p>
<p>But the U.N. health agency said last week that only about half of suspected infections in the DRC were being tested. And the agency noted that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.</p>
<p>While doctors are hopeful about the drop in infections in some parts of the DRC, they still do not know what kinds of physical contact are driving the outbreak. Health experts are also concerned about the low number of vaccines the Central African nation has received. The WHO estimates that only 50,000 people have been vaccinated in the DRC, which has a population of about 110 million.</p>
<p>Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent effort to vaccinate all of Africa to halt mpox's spread and avoid worse variants.</p>
<p>“If we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases <strong>substantially</strong>,” said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in the DRC for the nonprofit group ALIMA.</p>
<p>This year, there have been 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in the DRC.</p>
<p>Rhissa added, “We've seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained.” The 2017 mpox epidemic affected more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga — where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners — is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, <strong>surveillance</strong> and education.</p>
<p>Georgette Hamuli is an 18-year-old sex worker. Hamuli said she did not know about mpox until vaccination teams arrived in Goma recently. “The vaccine is also necessary,” she said. “I think we're now protected.”</p>
<p>The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated the DRC needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, the WHO and partners have provided 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda are believed to have started in the DRC. Several mpox cases affecting travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.</p>
<p>Dr. Salim Abdool Karim is an infectious diseases expert at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal. He said mpox outbreaks usually rise and then disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said the virus continues to spread through sex and infected animals.</p>
<p>“We're in new territory with mpox this time,” he added. “We're never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.”</p>

<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country's leader.</p>
<p>Trump secured at least 277 of the 538 available electoral votes in Tuesday's election. In the U.S. system, the presidential vote is counted in the states. Trump's victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin gave him a majority of Electoral College votes, which decide the U.S. presidency. Trump becomes the first U.S. leader to win two terms that are not <strong>consecutive</strong> since Grover Cleveland in 1892.</p>
<p>Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at a campaign event in Florida.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Former President Donald Trump gestures as he walks with former first lady Melania Trump at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla.

<p>"This was a movement like nobody's ever seen before, and, frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time," Trump said.</p>
<p>He promised to "fix our borders" and "fix everything in our country."</p>
<p>Trump also said he would work to provide a "strong, safe and <strong>prosperous</strong> America."</p>
<p>A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in Washington that she would not speak to the gathering but would speak later Wednesday.</p>
<p>Republican Party wins Tuesday extended to Congress. The party won a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet clearly decided early Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>World leaders offer congratulations</strong></p>
<p>World leaders offered congratulations to Trump after news media <strong>projections</strong> showed that he had secured a clear victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Early Wednesday, many world leaders expressed their opinions on social media service X.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first leaders of U.S. allies to send a message of support. He praised Trump's “historic return,” saying it would strengthen “the great alliance between Israel and America.”</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered Trump the “Heartiest congratulations.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised Trump's policy of “peace through strength.” He added, “This is exactly the <strong>principle</strong> that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer.”</p>
<p>NATO chief Mark Rutte said he was looking forward to working with Trump to “<strong>advance</strong> peace through strength” through the military alliance.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron offered congratulations, saying he is “ready to work together as we did for four years...with your conviction and mine.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the U.S. leader in defense of shared values of freedom, democracy and <strong>enterprise</strong>.</p>
<p>President of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen praised the “true partnership” between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>And Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban called Trump's victory the “biggest comeback in US political history.”</p>
<p>Trump is expected to be inaugurated for a new term on January 20.</p>

<p>Scientists in Argentina have discovered the oldest-known remains of the tadpole. The animal belonged to a large frog <strong>species</strong> that lived alongside dinosaurs about 161 million years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers said the 16-centimeter-long tadpole died during the larval period, or stage, of frog development. The discovery is providing new information about the development of frogs and toads.</p>
<p>The remains suggest tadpoles today are largely unchanged from their ancestors in the ancient time called the Jurassic period.

<p>The remains are in good condition. In fact, researchers say, the ancient tadpole has some soft tissues rarely seen in fossils. The tadpole's eyes and nerves, for example, appear as dark markings in the fossil.</p>
<p>Fossil hunters found the tadpole in 2020, during a dig for dinosaur remains on a ranch in the southern province of Santa Cruz. The fossil includes the tadpole's head and most of its body.</p>
<p>Frogs have a two-stage life cycle, with the tadpole larva developing into the adult form. This tadpole was in the late stages of development. Adults of this species are a similar length as the tadpole, the researchers said.</p>
<p>"It's not only the oldest tadpole in the world and amazingly <strong>preserved</strong>, but it also tells us about the size of one of the few frog species known from that time," said biologist Mariana Chuliver of Fundación Azara-Universidad Maimónides.</p>
<p>Chuliver was the lead writer of the study that appeared recently in the scientific publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>Chuliver said the soft tissue remains are important because they permit researchers to "know the diet and lifestyle of these organisms."</p>
<p>The remains, Chuliver added, show that the form and structure of tadpoles have "remained almost unchanged over the last 160 million years."</p>

            <title>Protecting Bulbs from Animals and Cold Weather (2024/11/6)</title>

<p>It would not be autumn without planting advice from Associated Press gardening expert Jessica Damiano.</p>
<p>Damiano recently wrote about her experience planting garlic <strong>cloves</strong>. She was concerned not just about protecting them from low winter temperatures. She was worried that animals would dig up her <strong>bulbs</strong> and eat them.</p>
<p>Tulips, daffodils and garlic, for example, produce bulbs that <strong>bloom</strong> in the spring in places that have four seasons and cold winters.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This Oct. 21, 2024, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows bird netting installed over a garden bed on Long Island, N.Y. (Jessica Damiano via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/84b313e9-91de-4b99-8140-ae805242dbe1_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This Oct. 21, 2024, image provided by Jessica Damiano shows bird netting installed over a garden bed on Long Island, N.Y. (Jessica Damiano via AP)</span></div>
<p>To keep away animals, Damiano put netting over the soil and covered it with straw<strong> </strong>to a thickness of 10 centimeters.</p>
<p>She said this is good to do with any bulbs, especially ones like garlic, tulips and crocuses. That is because animals like to eat the bulbs of these plants.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting bulbs</strong></p>
<p>Netting or a kind of fencing called chicken wire can serve as a physical barrier that prevents animals from digging up plants. Such barriers do not block sunlight and water from reaching the soil. Damiano said they can be secured to the ground with pieces of wood or rocks. They can be removed in the spring.</p>
<p>Straw is a good mulch material that helps keep the temperature of the soil from changing too much. That can help avoid damage to plants caused by freezing and <strong>thawing </strong>conditions. It also keeps the soil from drying out. Protecting soil is important during the winter when cold dry weather can damage even the strongest plants.</p>
<p><strong>Straw, hay, what is the difference?</strong></p>
<p>Damiano said it is important to use straw, not hay, in your garden. Hay is animal feed. It contains tall grass, alfalfa, clover and other seeds that will cause problems in your garden.</p>
<p>She said straw is leftover material from crop harvesting. It is better because it has fewer seeds.</p>
<p>Damiano also said straw is less likely to contain chemicals used for insect control on crops. Straw is also good for other purposes around your house, the gardening expert noted.</p>
<p><strong>Fertilizers and repellants</strong></p>
<p>Damiano does not like to use some popular fertilizers such as bone meal, blood meal or fish fertilizers. She said hungry animals might find such fertilizers appealing.</p>
<p>She also advises not to leave parts of bulbs on the ground in your garden because they might be a sign to animals that there is food nearby.</p>
<p>There are many products meant to keep away animals that eat bulbs, which include squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks and others. Damiano does not use <strong>repellants</strong> because they must be must be replaced often. She said she does not like doing garden work when it is cold outside.</p>
<p>Some repellants can be used to treat bulbs before planting. But, she said, they wear off over time. Damiano considered a physical barrier like netting or chicken wire to be the best defense.</p>
<p>But, she added, the repellants and other methods can be effective so long as you are <strong>diligent</strong>.</p>

            <title>Uncertain Time for Immigrants’ Children in School (2024/11/6)</title>

<p>On the first day of seventh grade in Aurora, Colorado, this past August, Alisson Ramirez worried about making friends and not understanding lessons taught in English.</p>
<p>"I was nervous that people would ask me things and I wouldn't know how to answer," the Venezuelan teen says. "And I would be <strong>ashamed</strong> to answer in Spanish."</p>
<p>But it was not what she had expected. Her teachers had translated words from their lessons into Spanish. They gave out written instructions in Spanish. Some teachers even asked in Spanish if students had finished or had questions.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Alisson Ram&lt;I&gt;&amp;#&lt;/I&gt;237;rez uses a laptop to work on an assignment during science class Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024, in Aurora, Colorado.

(AP Photo/Godofredo A. V<i>&amp;#</i>225;squez)</span></div>
<p>"That made me feel better," says Alisson. The 13-year-old is among the 3,000 new students, mostly from Venezuela and Colombia, at the Aurora public school system.</p>
<p><strong>City officials and false claims</strong></p>
<p>While teachers have been working hard to educate children of immigrants, outside the classrooms, city officials are not as welcoming. They promised not to spend any money helping newcomers and tried to keep them from coming to the area.</p>
<p>One city official even claimed that criminals from Venezuela had occupied buildings in Aurora. The police investigated and found it was not true. But the false claim continued to spread.</p>
<p>Maria Angel Torres is Alisson's mother. The family had left Venezuela to escape lawlessness and violence. They left behind a food truck business after being attacked for not paying protection money. The family then crossed the dangerous Darien Gap on foot to head north and seek asylum in the United States.</p>
<p>Torres said she did not believe criminals had <strong>taken over</strong> buildings. But she worried that bad reports about Venezuelans would affect her and her family. Some organizations and <strong>churches</strong> wanted to help her family. But others are deeply afraid.</p>
<p>Torres told the Associated Press, “I don't look like a threat. But people here act like they feel terrorized.”</p>
<p><strong>Times have changed in Aurora</strong></p>
<p>Aurora is used to educating children of immigrants.</p>
<p>The 2020 <strong>census</strong> reported that more than a third of people in Aurora speak a language other than English at home. Immigrants and refugees have been moving to Aurora because it is close to Denver and it has a lower cost of living.</p>
<p>However, some schools in the area were not ready for the sudden arrival of many non-English-speaking students from Venezuela and Colombia. Before, a teacher might have had one or two new students in her class. Now, teachers in some schools have as many as 10, or a third of their classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Translanguaging</strong></p>
<p>Marcella Garcia is the head of Aurora Hills Middle School. She observed that some new students were not talking in classrooms where only English was spoken. So, the school system advised teachers to use a method called "translanguaging." That means using Spanish or the home language at times to help new students understand English lessons and discussions happening around them.</p>
<p>The method has helped Alisson feel more at ease.</p>
<p>One day in September, Alisson and her friends spoke Spanish among themselves as their teacher spoke to the class in English about a drawing he was showing in front of the class.</p>
<p>It was a drawing of an ancient Egyptian marketplace. “What do you think this <strong>dude</strong> here is doing with the <strong>basket</strong>?” the teacher asked the class. One girl who had been in Aurora schools longer than the rest <strong>translated</strong> for Alisson and the other new students.</p>
<p>Before the school began using this new method, teachers may have stopped the new students from talking among themselves. Now, they permit students to help each other in any language they can.</p>
<p>So far, there appears to be little public criticism in the area against this method. It generally requires more work for teachers, who have to translate materials or their talks in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Rumors of violence</strong></p>
<p>Recently, Alisson's mother received messages from Aurora Public Schools that there have been <strong>rumors</strong> of bomb threats at its schools and others across the state. The schools said there was no truth to the rumors.</p>
<p>But that does not make Torres feel better. She said in Venezuela, the country is in trouble, but no one there would think of threatening children at school.</p>

            <title>US Health Officials Call for Shots Against Pneumonia (2024/11/5)</title>
            <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>American health officials say people age 50 and older should get vaccinated against bacteria that cause pneumonia and other dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is an infection that affects the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can cause a rise in body temperature. Pneumonia can also lead to a <strong>cough</strong> that produces yellow, green or bloody substances.</p>
<p>The advice, or recommendation, was offered by a group of scientific advisors and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The former age recommendation for adult vaccinations was 65 and older.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This electron microscopic image provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows two, round-shaped, Gram-positive, Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. (Janice Haney Carr/CDC via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/7d634f36-6b28-40d4-9cf1-fcae90210c66_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This electron microscopic image provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows two, round-shaped, Gram-positive, Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. (Janice Haney Carr/CDC via AP)</span></div>
<p>CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a statement, “Now is a great time to get vaccinated against pneumococcal disease in preparation for the winter <strong>respiratory</strong> season.”</p>
<p>The advisors voted 14-1 to change the age recommendation during an October meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the CDC headquarters. Doctors widely follow the agency's guidance.</p>
<p>Pneumococcal shot recommendations are sometimes called the most complex vaccination guidance that the government issues.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html">CDC currently recommends</a> shots for children younger than five and adults 50 or older, as long as they have never been vaccinated against pneumococcal disease. Officials also recommend the shots for children and adults at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, such as those with diabetes, liver disease or a weakened immune, or defense, system.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 known kinds of pneumococcal bacteria. They can cause serious infections in the lungs and other parts of the body. Each year, the U.S. sees about 30,000 cases of pneumococcal disease, which includes blood infections, brain and spine inflammation, and other problems. About 30 percent of cases are among people aged 50 to 64.</p>
<p>The first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1977. Since then, drugmakers have been coming up with newer versions that target several bacteria in a single shot.</p>
<p>There are four vaccines now in use. They include Prevnar 20 from Wyeth-Pfizer, and Vaxneuvance and Pneumovax 23 made by Merck. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year also approved Merck's Capvaxive, which can cost around $300 a treatment. The new shot can protect against 21 kinds of bacteria, including eight not included in other pneumococcal vaccines. A Merck spokesperson said it is designed to help protect against the bacteria that cause the majority of severe disease in adults aged 50 and older.</p>
<p>In June, the CDC advisors recommended the vaccine as a possible shot for adults at higher risk. At the time, the group also talked about the possibility of lowering the age recommendation for older adults. They noted that infections causing sickness <strong>peak </strong>at age 55 to 59 among Black Americans — a lower age than found among white Americans.</p>
<p>Some scientists have concerns about the CDC recommendation. They say a second treatment, called a booster, may be necessary in about 15 years. And some new vaccines in development could force another update to the recommendations.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamie Loehr is the chair of the committee's pneumococcal working group. He was the only person to vote against the proposal.</p>
<p>He said, “Pneumococcal has been a very <strong>confusing </strong>recommendation for many, many years and it's hard to have a new recommendation every two or three years.”</p>

<p>One of the biggest names in America's music industry – Quincy Jones – has died at the age of 91. A family statement said Jones passed away Sunday night surrounded by family members at his home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Jones is known for working with many top names in the music industry, including superstars Michael Jackson, Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles. Throughout his 65-year career, he worked with hundreds of other music artists.</p>
<p>Jones' publicist Arnold Robinson said in a statement, “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing.” It added, “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Music producer Quincy Jones poses for a portrait to promote his documentary " ap="" by="" chris="" during="" festival="" file="" film="" in="" invision="" on="" pizzello="" quincy="" sept.="" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3942d3ab-85cf-4f68-938c-6c6529fe13c1_w268_r1.jpg" the="" toronto="" toronto.=""/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - Music producer Quincy Jones poses for a portrait to promote his documentary "Quincy" during the Toronto Film Festival on Sept. 7, 2018, in Toronto.

<p>Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones said an early music influence was the <strong>hymns </strong>his mother used to sing around the house. Early on, he played music, the trumpet, and led others in band music.</p>
<p>As a very young man, Jones used to run with <strong>gangs</strong> on the South Side of Chicago. But he later rose to the top of show business, becoming one of the first Black business leaders in Hollywood. Later, he established himself as a major <strong>composer</strong> and producer.</p>
<p>Jones shaped recordings by jazz greats such as Miles Davis and produced hits for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. And he helped organize the 1985 money-raising event for Africa that resulted in the song <em>We Are the World</em>. The song went on to become one of the biggest hits of its time.</p>
<p>Jones composed music for <em>Roots</em> and <em>In the Heat of the Night</em>. He also organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration in 1993. Jones also wrote several movie <strong>scores</strong> and co-produced the film <em>The Color Purple</em>. In addition, he co-produced the highly successful 1990s television show <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>, which launched the career of Will Smith.</p>
<p>Jones's work with superstar Michael Jackson still represents one of his most lasting successes. He and Jackson made three wildly popular albums: <em>Off the Wall</em> in 1979, <em>Thriller</em> in 1982, and <em>Bad</em> in 1987.</p>
<p><em>Thriller</em> sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone. It helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless other performers. Jones later explained, “Michael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of.”</p>
<p>Jones was known for keeping company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, <strong>philanthropists</strong> and business leaders. His circle of friends included some of the most famous people of the 20th century, including artist Pablo Picasso, Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>The list of Jones' honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography <em>Q</em>. The book made him a best-selling writer. He won a total of 27 Grammy Awards, as well as two honorary Academy Awards and an Emmy for the television series <em>Roots</em>.</p>
<p>Jones also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center honor for his influence over American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary called "<em>Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,</em>" as well as the 2018 film <em>Quincy</em>, directed by his daughter, Rashida Jones.</p>

<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are making a final push for votes on the day before Election Day in the United States.</p>
<p>Harris is spending the day in the state of Pennsylvania, looking to win its 19 Electoral College votes. In addition to Pennsylvania, Trump holds campaign events in North Carolina and Michigan.</p>
<p>About 77 million Americans have already voted early. The total is nearly half of the 158 million who voted through Election Day in 2020. Harris and Trump are now pushing for the votes of remaining supporters and undecided voters as voting ends on Election Day, Tuesday, November 5.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="File photos show Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris (L) at a campaign rally Erie, Pa., on Oct. 14, 2024, and Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Uniondale, N.Y., on Sept.18, 2024.

<p><strong>Electoral College</strong></p>
<p>In U.S. presidential elections, the candidate who captures 270 or more Electoral College votes is the winner, regardless of the popular vote.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/federal-elections-2016/">In 2016</a>, Democrat Hillary Clinton received nearly 3 million votes more than Trump nationwide. But Trump won 304 Electoral College votes and the presidency. <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/federal-elections-2020/">In 2020</a>, Democrat Joe Biden received 7 million votes more than Trump and also won 306 Electoral College votes.</p>
<p>This year, the race comes down to results from seven states, called battleground or swing states, because of changing results from election to election. The states are Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona.</p>
<p>Trump won Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016 but lost all five states to Biden in 2020. This year, opinion studies from all seven states suggest that Harris and Trump are basically tied.</p>
<p>The vice president became the Democratic candidate after President Biden withdrew from the race in July. The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/democrats-back-harris-as-biden-leaves-presidential-race/7708239.html">81-year-old Biden said he would not seek reelection</a> after a poor performance debating Trump in June.</p>
<p><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/a-short-history-of-attacks-on-us-presidents-candidates/7698894.html">Trump survived an assassination attempt</a> in Butler, Pennsylvania, also in June when a bullet struck his right ear. The gunman was killed after firing several shots. One other person was killed and two were injured at the Trump campaign event.</p>
<p><strong>Trump on the issues</strong></p>
<p>Trump launched his third campaign for the White House by renewing his “Make America Great Again” message and calling for a severe policy on illegal immigration. He promised to deport, or expel, 15 to 20 million illegal immigrants from the country.</p>
<p>Trump blamed Biden and Harris for the inflation that came after the worldwide pandemic. He said his administration would increase taxes, called tariffs, on imported goods, cut taxes for Americans, open more lands for oil and gas exploration and reduce <strong>regulations</strong> for businesses.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Trump has criticized NATO and suggested that the U.S. should step back from other defense treaties. Trump has not said whether he would send more military aid to Ukraine and claimed that he could end the war in the country. Trump said he supports Israel in its war in Gaza and Lebanon. He condemned pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S. and told <em>Time</em> magazine that the two-state solution might not be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Harris on the issues</strong></p>
<p>Harris, at the age of 60, is <strong>projecting</strong> her campaign against the 78-year-old Trump as a generational change saying, “We're not going back.”</p>
<p>Harris brings attention to her support for <strong>abortion</strong> rights after the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/us-high-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-ending-abortion-right/6632104.html">Supreme Court's 2022 decision</a> overturning the earlier Supreme Court decision known as <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Harris said that she “will sign a law restoring and protecting reproductive freedom in every state.” While president, Trump appointed three conservative justices to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, and he said the issue belongs to the states.</p>
<p>On immigration, Harris has spoken of her support for a bipartisan proposal for border security that would increase officers to deal with asylum seekers among other things.</p>
<p>On the economy, Harris said she supports higher taxes for companies and wealthy Americans and lower taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year. She calls Trump's proposed tariffs a tax increase on everyday Americans. Some tariffs put in place during Trump's term in office have remained in place under Biden.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Harris supports an active role for the U.S. in NATO and other military alliances. She supports continuing U.S. aid to Ukraine against the Russian invasion there. Harris has said that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas's terrorist attacks. She has called for a cease-fire so that all hostages can be released and has described the situation in Gaza as a “humanitarian <strong>catastrophe</strong>.” She also supports a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>A Trump victory would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony in a New York trial. Trump denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the verdict.</p>
<p>A Harris victory would make her the first woman, the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian ancestry to win the U.S. presidency.</p>
<p>And now it is up to the American people.</p>

            <title>NASA to Launch Instruments to Study Water on Moon (2024/11/4)</title>

<p>The American space agency NASA is preparing to launch a spacecraft to seek more detailed information on water sources on the moon.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is an orbiter called Lunar Trailblazer. It is set to launch later this year, or in early 2025. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry the orbiter to space. That rocket will also transport another moon exploring spacecraft.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasas-lunar-trailblazer-could-decipher-the-moons-icy-secrets/">said</a> Lunar Trailblazer passed a series of important operational tests. It is currently completing additional software testing designed to <strong>simulate</strong> different elements of the trip, or mission.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This artist's concept shows NASA's Lunar Trailblazer in lunar orbit about 100 kilometers from the surface of the Moon.

<p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is leading the mission, in cooperation with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California. Lockheed Martin Space provided the spacecraft, linked it with the flight system, and supports operations as part of a contract with Caltech.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will use two science instruments to carry out its mission. Both instruments are designed to map the moon in search of areas containing water, as well as what forms the water is in. The two instruments use infrared technology to produce highly detailed mapped images.</p>
<p>Lunar Trailblazer weighs about 200 kilograms and measures 3.5 meters with its solar equipment fully deployed. The spacecraft is set to orbit the moon about 100 kilometers from the lunar surface.</p>
<p>Several past studies have provided strong evidence that water exists on the moon. But the evidence has not included exact details on where it is and what forms it might take. Scientists believe most of the water is solid, in the form of ice. But there could be areas where water exists in liquid form, or as a gas in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>One <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/study-water-sources-on-moon-more-widespread-than-thought/7800840.html">study</a> released last month suggested that existing water on the moon is more widespread than previously thought. That study was based on new examinations of data collected by India's Chandrayaan-1 orbiting spacecraft.</p>
<p>NASA has said its search for water on the moon is important because it is seen as a necessary resource for future exploration activities. Astronauts could process it for drinking water, to cool equipment, to create breathable oxygen or even to make rocket fuel.</p>
<p>NASA said Lunar Trailblazer will make it easier for future human or robotic science investigators to use the water to see where it first came from.</p>
<p>For example, the presence of ammonia in ice could suggest it came from <strong>comets</strong>, NASA said. The presence of sulfur, on the other hand, could show it rose to the surface from deep inside the lunar interior when the moon was young and volcanically active.</p>
<p>One of the instruments, the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper, was developed by the JPL. The other, called the Lunar Thermal Mapper, was built by a team at the University of Oxford in Britain.</p>
<p>Neil Bowles is an instrument scientist for the Lunar Thermal Mapper. He said in a statement the instrument would center on producing detailed maps of lunar surface temperatures. He added that the other instrument will look for a series of signs, called signatures, of water molecules.</p>
<p>“Both instruments will <strong>allow</strong> us to understand how surface temperature affects water, improving our knowledge of the presence and <strong>distribution</strong> of these molecules on the moon,” Bowles said.</p>
<p>The orbiter is designed to provide scientists with new information about how much movement there is of water molecules on the moon. Such movements can be linked to how much sun specific areas receive. “Understanding whether water molecules move freely across the surface of the moon or are locked inside rock is also scientifically important,” NASA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rachel Klima is an investigator for the Lunar Trailblazer spacecraft and its systems at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.</p>
<p>She said data collected by the instruments can help provide information about where the moon's water first came from. Klima compared such examinations to those involving <strong>glaciers</strong> that help scientists learn about Earth's ancient history. Ice on the moon, she said, “could provide <strong>clues</strong> as to where that water came from and how and when it got there.”</p>

            <title>Climate Extremes Continue, Bringing Floods to Spain (2024/11/4)</title>

<p>Even for a period of extreme weather, this autumn has had more than the usual weather disasters.</p>
<p>The Spanish province Valencia has seen the latest incident of massive and deadly flooding in Europe. Heavy downpours also hit France, Austria and Czechia this fall. Italy has had two major floods, once in September and then again in October.</p>
<p>More than 200 people have been killed in the flooding in Spain. At the same time, over half of the United States experiences an almost rain-free October.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Damaged cars are seen along a road affected by torrential rains that caused flooding, on the outskirts of Valencia, Spain, October 31, 2024. (REUTERS/Eva Manez)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/c43a90b7-3b6a-493b-960c-8bbefb845afb_cx0_cy5_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">Damaged cars are seen along a road affected by torrential rains that caused flooding, on the outskirts of Valencia, Spain, October 31, 2024. (REUTERS/Eva Manez)</span></div>
<p>Scientists studying the recent weather say the heavy rains are probably connected to climate change in two ways. They say a warmer atmosphere holds and then releases more <strong>moisture</strong>. The other connection is possible changes in the jet stream that could cause extreme weather. The jet stream is the river of air above land that moves weather systems around the planet.</p>
<p>Several climate scientists and <strong>meteorologists</strong> said the immediate cause of the flooding is a cut-off lower pressure storm system that came from an unusually wavy and slowed jet stream.</p>
<p>In the United States, the slow movement caused a sunny, high-pressure system with no moisture to cover the country and keep storms away.</p>
<p>"If we're getting all the dryness, somebody else is getting all the rain," said Yale Climate Connection meteorologist Jeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground.</p>
<p>"The same extremely wavy jet stream that is causing the U.S. <strong>drought</strong> is also responsible for the horrific flooding in eastern Spain," said climate scientist Jennifer Francis. She is with the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Francis is an early developer of the theory that connects a wavier and slower-moving jet stream to climate change. The theory is that the Arctic is warming so much; it is now not much colder than the rest of the planet. That theory is gaining more acceptance, but it is not fully accepted by the climate science community.</p>
<p>Climate scientist Erich Fischer is with the university ETH Zurich in Switzerland. He does not fully accept the wavy jet stream theory. But then he lists the storm systems that have slowed and flooded Europe this fall: one in France and two in Italy in September and October and flooding in Austria and the Czech Republic in September.</p>
<p>And then there were the October floods in the Balkans, although Fischer said he is not sure they are similar enough. The European climate service Copernicus says parts of Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic got three months of rain in just five days in September.</p>
<p>Fischer also spoke of the floods in Europe during the summer. "Starting with Bavaria, southern Germany in June, and then it was something like six events in Austria and Switzerland in the mountains, extreme thunderstorms, and now this autumn.”</p>
<p>He said it was an unusual period in which the systems, especially in Spain, France and Austria, stopped in one place and "the rain did not move" from the same valleys for hours.</p>
<p>Even without the changes to the jet stream, several scientists said they are sure that basic <strong>physics</strong> are making storms like this wetter.</p>
<p>It holds that every degree Celsius the air warms, it can hold seven percent more moisture. The world has warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius because of greenhouse gases, so it has about nine to 10 percent heavier rain, at the least, said Imperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto. She helps run an organization called World Weather Attribution. It checks for human causes of extreme weather, sometimes finding them, sometimes not.</p>
<p>She said it is very clear that climate change is linked to the rain event in Valencia.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean Sea had its warmest surface temperature on record in mid-August, with a mean temperature of 28.47 Celsius, said Carola Koenig of the Centre for Flood Risk and Resilience at Brunel University of London.</p>
<p>She said that means more moisture is in the air, “resulting in more rain when the atmosphere starts to cool in the autumn.” She warned there may be more heavy rain after this week's storm.</p>
<p>There may be different ways of counting and <strong>attributing</strong> climate change and the problems it causes, Otto said, but one thing is for certain: "Burning fossil fuels causes climate change and climate change causes death and destruction."</p>

<p>Canadian Olivier Rioux is the world's tallest teenager.</p>
<p>At 2.4 meters tall, he has a place in the Guinness World Records as the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2021/9/canadian-confirmed-as-tallest-teenager-in-the-world-675836">world's tallest living teenager</a>.</p>
<p>Soon, he will make basketball history when he plays for the University of Florida.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Olivier Rioux, back center, a 2.4-meter-tall college basketball player at Florida, gathers with coaches and teammates at the team's practice, Friday, Oct. 18, 2024, in Gainesville, Fla.

(AP Photo/John Raoux)</span></div>
<p>Known as “Oli,” he will become the tallest person to play college basketball. Rioux is about 5 centimeters taller than former professional basketball players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) like Gheorghe Muresan and Manute Bol. And he is nearly 8 centimeters taller than former NBA player Yao Ming of China.</p>
<p>When he walks from his college housing to classes at the University of Florida, Rioux stops a lot -- sometimes hundreds of times a day -- to take pictures with people.</p>
<p>“You don't have a single three seconds to yourself when you're outside, which I was fine with because my brother and my dad are tall. And, as a family, we used to go out. That's just how it was, and you can't change that because people are <strong>curious,</strong>” Rioux said.</p>
<p>His college teammates have already gotten used to it.</p>
<p>“It's really weird looking up to someone,” said teammate Micah Handlogten who is 2.2 meters tall. “People normally ask me, ‘You're so tall. Do you play basketball?' No one says a word to me (now). Everyone just looks at him. It's kind of crazy. He doesn't <strong>shy away from</strong> it,” he added. </p>
<p>Rioux actually enjoys it. He welcomes the looks, the questions and all the picture requests.</p>
<p>“You just get used to it,” he said. “Talking to people is nice because they are curious, and you can't change that.”</p>
<p>Rioux has worked hard to prepare for college basketball at the top level. The team expects Rioux to be a fan favorite. Coach Todd Golden said, “About 95 percent of my <strong>conversations</strong> with <strong>random</strong> people about our team are about him. It's the first time we've been ranked since 2019 and it's like, ‘Hey, Coach, we're really excited to see Oli out there this year.' And I get it, man. He's a very unique individual.”</p>
<p>Rioux grew up in Terrebonne, Quebec. At an early age, he was already taller than most of his teachers. He was 1.8 meters tall by age 8 and reached more than 2 meters before middle school.</p>
<p>Rioux started playing basketball at age 5. But he is still learning the game at the college level. Rioux can dunk the ball in the basket without leaving his feet. He wears No. 32 because of his affection for former NBA greats Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal, another 2-meter-tall player.</p>
<p>Rioux would like to model his game after French superstar Victor Wembanyama.</p>
<p>Most people have the same reaction when seeing Rioux for the first time. Just about every picture taken of him goes viral.</p>
<p>“He doesn't seek the attention, but he also doesn't get annoyed at the people that ask,” teammate Handlogten said. “He <strong>embraces</strong> it because it's part of him, and he loves that...”</p>

<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories</em> from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes. So, we have the expression <u>to err is human</u>.</p>
<p>People who accept responsibility or blame will often say “I'm sorry,” or “I was wrong.” Others might say, "It's my fault” or “I apologize." Often friends use expressions like “That was on me” or “My bad.”</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Pope Francis apologizes to Indigenous peoples for abuses committed by missionaries during a visit at Maskwaci, the former Ermineskin Residential School, Monday, July 25, 2022, in Maskwacis, Alberta.

<p>But there is another way to say that you accept responsibility or admit that you made a mistake. Some English speakers may say <u>mea culpa</u>.</p>
<p>If that does not sound like English, that's because it isn't.</p>
<p>American dictionary publisher <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mea%20culpa"><em>Merriam-Webster</em> says</a> that <u>mea culpa</u> means "through my fault" in Latin. The phrase comes from a prayer of <strong>confession</strong> in the Catholic Church. By itself, the expression is used to mean "It was my fault" or "I apologize."</p>
<p><u>Mea culpa</u> is also a noun.</p>
<p>People caught doing something wrong often give, or issue, a <u>mea culpa</u>. For example, when an official is caught doing something wrong, she might issue a statement that includes a <u>mea culpa</u>.</p>
<p>Let's hear an example:</p>
<p><em>The mayor's <u>mea culpa</u> did not change the minds of voters, and she lost the election.</em></p>
<p><u>Mea culpa</u> is one of many English terms that come from the Latin word <u>culpa</u> which means guilt. Other examples include <strong>culpable</strong>, <strong>culprit,</strong> and <strong>exculpate</strong>.</p>
<p>When someone deserves blame for something, especially something harmful, we say he is <u>culpable</u> for the outcomes. For example:</p>
<p><em>Investigators said that the carmaker was <u>culpable</u> for thousands of accidents because of faulty brakes.</em></p>
<p>A <u>culprit</u> is a person guilty of a crime or a fault. That is why police officers often call a person guilty of crime a <u>culprit</u>.</p>
<p>And the word <u>exculpate</u> means to clear someone from suspected fault or guilt. Here's an example:</p>
<p><em>The husband was <u>exculpated</u> of his wife's death when she was found alive living in Paris under a fake name. </em></p>
<p>And that's all the time we have for this <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>
<p>Until next time ... I'm Anna Matteo.</p>

<p>The <strong>hug</strong> between the two women lasted a long time.</p>
<p>An 85-year-old woman put her arms around a younger woman she had not seen for months. She asked her a series of questions in a song-like way.</p>
<p><em>How are you? How is your husband? How are the kids? How are your cows? Are you on good terms with your neighbors?</em></p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/d3fa0568-86ae-45de-b6a6-f8336aa3465e_cx7_cy4_cw88_w100_r1.png"/></div>
<p>Prudencienne Namukobwa stopped the song to permit the younger woman to answer. The pattern is familiar to her because she has been doing it for many years.</p>
<p>"Ego," Emelyne Nzeyimana answered over and over in the local Kirundi language. "Yes."</p>
<p>The two women were performing a greeting of their ancestors.</p>
<p>A group of neighbors watched with surprise. Many were seeing their first performance of the traditional form of musical greeting, known to Burundians as <em>akazehe</em>. It is performed only by women.</p>
<p><em>Akazehe</em> is becoming less common. But cultural officials, teachers and others say the greeting is worth keeping.</p>
<p>During disease outbreaks, public health officials urged people to limit close contact. Such recommendations affected the greeting.</p>
<p>Among young people in Burundi, it is hard to find those who know what <em>akazehe</em> means. It is even harder to find someone who can perform it.</p>
<p>Sandrine Kitonze is a culture advisor in the office of the governor of Ngozi province. She said people stopped doing the greeting, even though <em>akazehe</em> "made you feel that the person who greets you loves you."</p>
<p>Some experts have noted <em>akazehe</em> could help lead to a feeling of unity in Burundi. The country is now largely peaceful following a period of deadly civil war and political unrest.</p>
<p>Annonciate Baragahorana is a teacher in the province of Bujumbura. She told the Associated Press that when she visited the central plateau area as a young girl, she was surprised and a little uneasy when women hugged and greeted her in this song-like way. "I wanted her to finish quickly, even if it was sweet words to hear."</p>
<p>Baragahorana said she feared <em>akazehe</em> may disappear because of the fear of spreading diseases. Now, she said, "people greet each other from a distance.”</p>
<p>Namukobwa lives in Ngozi a hilly province in Burundi's north. On a recent morning, she was sitting on a mat outside when she saw Nzeyimana, the visiting daughter of a former neighbor. She rose and welcomed the woman as if she were her own daughter.</p>
<p>"I felt that the first love she had when I was just a girl is kept until now," said Nzeyimana, a broadcaster in Ngozi. "This means that I am still her daughter."</p>
<p>Isaac Nikobiba is an <strong>anthropologist</strong> in Bujumbura. He said a custom such as <em>akazehe</em> should be kept <strong>at all costs</strong> because of its role in protecting families. Among communities that practice it, women could tell elder women about any problems at home. That could bring support from the extended family, he said.</p>
<p>Nikobiba said the threat to <em>akazehe</em> is part of other effects of modernization.</p>
<p>He explained how the custom worked to help younger women. "Normally, before starting a home in traditional Burundi, the girl would first receive advice from her father's sister. She would tell the girl, 'I will come to greet you after a certain time.'”</p>
<p>Nikobiba added that during that greeting, the young woman could report any problems. Support from elders would help them develop better mental health for the young family, he said.</p>
<p>Floride Ntakirutimana was among the small group of women who gathered to watch Namukobwa greeting Nzeyimana. She said she grew up in a farming community where no mother could perform <em>akazehe</em>. She only heard of it through radio programs.</p>
<p>After watching, she wanted to learn <em>akazehe</em> herself. "I feel better, Ntakirutimana said, “and I saw that it was good.”</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Haruna in Japan about the usage of the words “near” and “nearby.”</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/8009536b-0005-4cc5-a3a1-d7d35ff077dc_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>Today, I have a question about two words, "near" and "nearby.”</p>
<p>What is [the] difference between these two words?</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards,</p>
<p>Haruna</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Haruna.</p>
<p>Both words can mean “close in distance to something.”</p>
<p>The word “near” also has other meanings, as we will see.</p>
<p>We can put the word “nearby” at the end of a sentence. For example, if you are in someone's house and a person in the house says:</p>
<p><em>The market is <u>nearby</u>.</em></p>
<p>That means the market is close to the house. The speaker does not need to say the word “house” because the word “nearby” means close to the place already stated or known.</p>
<p>However, when we use the word “near” to say where something is, we say both places. The following example shows this:</p>
<p><em>Their house is <u>near</u> the market.</em></p>
<p>The following two examples also show this difference in usage between “nearby” and “near”:</p>
<p><em>The doctor's office is <u>nearby</u>.</em></p>
<p><em>The doctor's office is <u>near</u> the bank. </em></p>
<p>We can also use “nearby” as an adjective before a noun, as in this example:</p>
<p><em>Pollution from a <u>nearby</u> factory makes the air unhealthy to breathe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Other uses of “near”</strong></p>
<p>Next, let's look at three other ways we can use the word “near.” We can use it as an adverb to express the idea that something will happen soon in the future, as in this example:</p>
<p><em>The end of our trip is <u>near</u>.</em></p>
<p>We can also use “near” as a compound adjective, as in the following example:</p>
<p><em>That old car is still in <u>near</u>-perfect condition.</em></p>
<p>Remember that when we write compound adjectives, we must put a hyphen, or short line, connecting the two adjectives.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can use the word “near” as a verb, meaning “getting close to in time,” as in this example:</p>
<p><em>The building project is <u>nearing</u> completion.</em></p>

            <title>Large Fish Thought to Have Disappeared Found in Mekong River (2024/11/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Researchers say a large fish that was thought to have disappeared from Asia's Mekong River has been seen in the waterway in recent years.</p>
<p>The fish is called a giant salmon carp. A recent study detailed the most recent sightings of the fish. The lead writer of that study said the fish was seen at least three times between 2020 and 2023.</p>
<p>The <strong>predatory</strong> fish can grow to more than one meter in length and has an identifiable yellow spot surrounding its large eyes.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This undated photo provided by Chhut Chheana shows a researcher holding a giant salmon carp Aaptosyax grypus rediscovered in Cambodia. (Chhut Chheana/Wonders of the Mekong via AP)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/549b171f-59ad-4db0-b8b7-3d36afb1b583_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This undated photo provided by Chhut Chheana shows a researcher holding a giant salmon carp Aaptosyax grypus rediscovered in Cambodia. (Chhut Chheana/Wonders of the Mekong via AP)</span></div>
<p>The Mekong River is Southeast Asia's longest river. It passes through China, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. About 60 million people depend on the river for food and survival. It is also an important environment for numerous river creatures.</p>
<p>The leader of the research was Chheana Chhut. He is with the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. “The giant salmon carp is like a <strong>symbol</strong> of the Mekong region,” Chheana recently told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>He was the co-writer with other researchers of <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320724003768?dgcid=coauthor">a study</a> announcing the findings in the publication <em>Biological Conservation</em>. Chheana said researchers had believed that the last confirmed sighting of the fish in the Mekong was in 2005.</p>
<p>But since 2017, biologists following the movements of migratory fish in Cambodia developed relationships with local fishing communities. They asked people in the communities to inform them of any unusual sightings.</p>
<p>That process led to the finding that three giant salmon carp were identified in the Mekong River and a neighboring waterway in Cambodia between 2020 and 2023.</p>
<p>Bunyeth Chan is a researcher at Cambodia's Svay Rieng University. He helped lead the research. Bunyeth told the AP, “I was really surprised and excited to see the real fish for the first time.”</p>
<p>Researchers say the sightings give them new hope for the future of the <strong>species</strong>. Another name used for the species is “ghost fish.”</p>
<p>“This rediscovery is very exciting, <strong>positive</strong> news,” said Zeb Hogan. He is a fish biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was part of the research team.</p>
<p>But the problems the fish experienced also demonstrate the dangers facing all migratory species in the Mekong. The huge river faces industrial pollution and overfishing, among other problems.</p>
<p>Brian Eyler is director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. He was was not involved in the research. Eyler said one issue is that more than 700 dams are built along the river and neighboring waterways. In addition, there are very few workable “fish passages” that help species avoid <strong>obstructions</strong>.</p>
<p>The Greater Mekong area includes Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar.</p>
<p>The researchers said they hope that cooperation with local communities in Thailand and Laos will permit them to confirm whether the fish also still swims in other parts of the Mekong.</p>

            <title>Brazilian Artist’s Mural Shows Climate Disasters (2024/11/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Brazilian artist and activist Mundano recently used some unusual substances to paint a picture on a building in Sao Paulo. The paint included materials, such as ash and mud, collected from natural disasters.</p>
<p>Mundano created the mural to highlight the issue of climate change. Extreme weather events have been causing destruction across Brazil.</p>
<p>The mural is very large – over 30 meters high and 48 meters wide. The artist used ash from wildfires and mud from floods. His painting shows the gray remains of trees on a brown land so dry it is <strong>cracked</strong>. The picture represents the deforestation and severe <strong>drought</strong> in the Amazon rainforest.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A mural by artist-activist Mundano depicting the drought in the Amazon rainforest using paint made from the ashes of wildfires in the Amazon and mud from the floods in southern Brazil covers a building in Sao Paulo, Tuesday, Oct. 22, 2024.

<p>The mural also shows Indigenous activist Alessandra Korap wearing a circle of flowers around her head. She holds a sign that says: “Stop the destruction #keepyourpromise.” The artist says those messages are directed to Cargill, a massive soybean producer based in the United States.</p>
<p>Soy farming is one of the biggest causes of deforestation in the Amazon.</p>
<p>Cargill says on its website that it will <strong>eliminate</strong> deforestation from its <strong>supply chain</strong> in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay by 2025.</p>
<p>Mundano is seeking to hold the company <strong>accountable.</strong></p>
<p>“We are tired of being a country, a continent where we and the natural resources we have here are <strong>exploited</strong>. ... We have to regenerate our planet instead of destroying it,” the artist said in an interview.</p>
<p>Cargill did not immediately answer a request for comment.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, human-caused wildfires have severely damaged protected places in the Amazon area. The fires burned in parts of both the large Cerrado <strong>savanna</strong> and the world's largest <strong>tropical </strong><strong>wetland</strong>, the Pantanal.</p>
<p>Smoke spread over a very large area and affected the air quality in some Brazilian cities.<i></i>173;</p>
<p>Drought has caused a critical situation nationwide. Weather predictions show that this will continue in much of the country through at least the rest of October. This information comes from Cemaden, Brazil's disaster warning center.</p>
<p><strong>Droughts &amp; floods</strong></p>
<p>On October 22, the depth of the Amazon's Negro River measured 12.46 meters, representing a small increase from 10 days earlier. At that time, the river was at its lowest point since measurements started 122 years ago.</p>
<p>And this last reported measure is still about 6 meters below normal for the same date in earlier years.</p>
<p>Rivers in Brazil's Amazon always rise and fall with its rainy and dry seasons. But the dry season this year has been much worse than usual.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a severe flood in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul killed more than 180 people, affected over 2 million people, and destroyed city communities.</p>
<p>Mundano, who calls himself an “artivist” (a combination of "artist and activist), used mud from that flood to create the new mural. The activist group Movement of People Affected by Dams collected the materials.</p>
<p>Mundano also used ashes from Brazil's fires in the Atlantic Forest, the Pantanal, and the Cerrado. He also used earth found in waste containers in Sao Paulo and clay collected from the Sawre Muybu Indigenous land in the Amazon, where Alessandra Korap is from.</p>
<p>“From floods to droughts, everything is connected!” Mundano said recently in an Instagram post. He included a video showing the mural in Sao Paulo. The artist said it is his biggest mural ever.</p>
<p>Three years ago, he used ash from the Amazon to create a similar mural in Sao Paulo. That work showed a firefighter standing in deforested areas. It also showed a cow farm and trucks loaded with cut trees.</p>

            <title>In, On and At: Prepositions of Time and Place (2024/11/1)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">31 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>When English speakers talk about time and place, there are three little words that often come up: <u>in</u>, <u>on</u>, and <u>at</u>. These common words are prepositions that show a relationship between two words in a sentence.</p>
<p>Some prepositions are rather easy for English learners to understand: behind, over, under, next to, etc...</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/bee03445-284e-4a3e-9270-2930c091fd1c_tv_w100_r1.jpg"/></div>
<p>But these little two-letter prepositions seem to create confusion. Here are a few rules to help you understand when to use <u>in</u>, <u>on</u>, and <u>at</u> in a sentence.</p>
<p>For describing time and place, the prepositions <u>in</u>, <u>on</u>, and <u>at</u> go from <strong>general</strong> to <strong>specific</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Prepositions and Time</strong></p>
<p>Let's start by looking at how we talk about time. English speakers use <u>in</u> to refer to a general, longer period of time, such as months, years, decades, or centuries. For example, we say “<u>in</u> April,” “<u>in</u> 2015” or “<u>in</u> the 21st century.”</p>
<p>Moving to shorter, more specific periods of time, we use <u>on</u> to talk about particular days, dates, and holidays . You may hear, “I went to work <u>on</u> Monday,” or “Let's have a picnic <u>on</u> Memorial Day.”</p>
<p>For the most specific times, and for holidays without the word “day,” we use <u>at</u>. That means you will hear, “Meet me <u>at</u> midnight,” or “The flowers are in bloom <u>at</u> Easter time.”</p>
<p><strong>Prepositions and Place</strong></p>
<p>When English speakers refer to a place, we use <u>in</u> for the largest or most general places. You can say that “VOA is located <u>in</u> Washington, D.C.” And “for the best food, try the restaurants <u>in</u> Chinatown.”</p>
<p>For more specific places, like certain streets, we use the preposition <u>on</u>. You may know that President Obama lives <u>on</u> Pennsylvania Avenue <u>in</u> Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to the most specific places. For exact addresses or <strong>intersections, </strong>we use the preposition <u>at</u><strong>. </strong> If I invited you to visit us here at VOA, I would say, “Come to my office <u>at</u> 330 Independence Avenue.” To be exact, it's <u>at</u> the corner of Independence and 3<sup>rd</sup> Street.”</p>
<p>In English, though, there is always an ‘exception to the rule.' When talking about transportation, things get a little hard to understand. We use <u>on</u> for public vehicles like buses or trains, but also for smaller ones like a bicycle. “I rode there <u>on</u> my bicycle.” However, you ride <u>in</u> a car.</p>
<p>Still, it helps to know that English prepositions do have some rules.</p>
<p>Following the “general to specific” rule should help you most of the time.</p>

<p>Phones hold so much of our digital lives — emails, social media and bank accounts, photos and more.</p>
<p>As a result, if our phones ever get stolen or lost, we can face major problems.</p>
<p>In some places, phone thefts have increased. Britain, for example, has some 200 phones stolen every day in “snatch thefts” - when a person steals a phone in a public place, sometimes right out of an owner's hand, and escapes quickly.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - A woman holds a phone to her ear as she walks along the high street of Richmond, in London, Britain, October 11, 2024. (REUTERS/Jaimi Joy)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/30d913bc-75c3-4575-9dc3-1a29c6f7204c_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - A woman holds a phone to her ear as she walks along the high street of Richmond, in London, Britain, October 11, 2024. (REUTERS/Jaimi Joy)</span></div>
<p>The government has promised to take steps against the crime and is meeting with technology companies and device makers to come up with solutions.</p>
<p>Here are steps you can take before and after your phone goes missing.</p>
<p><strong>Basic steps </strong></p>
<p>There are things you can do to make it less painful if someone steals your phone. Because some of these features are more<strong> technical</strong> in nature, people often do not think of them.</p>
<p>Lock down as much as you can. At a minimum, require a password or special scan to unlock the device.</p>
<p>You can also add similar requirements to important individual apps — like your banking account, WhatsApp or Signal — to protect your finances or messaging from thieves.</p>
<p>You will probably have lots of important photos saved on your camera roll.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to back the photos up, along with contacts, calendar and other files. Google and Apple offer cloud-based backup services, although the free versions have limited <strong>storage</strong> space. You can also back up your files to an <strong>external</strong> hard drive, memory card or a laptop.</p>
<p>Some police forces and phone companies advise turning off message previews. This prevents thieves trying to break into your accounts from seeing reset or login codes when the phone is locked.</p>
<p>To do this on an iPhone, for example, go to Notifications in your settings and choose Show Previews. You can also go down the app list to turn previews off for individual apps but leave them on for less risky ones like news or weather.</p>
<p><strong>Turn on newer features </strong></p>
<p>Recent iOS and Android updates include a number of new elements designed to make thefts less profitable.</p>
<p>IPhone users can turn on Stolen Device Protection, which makes it a lot harder for phone thieves to change key <strong>functions</strong> and settings. Many thieves will want to wipe the data off and reset so they can resell it, but with this <strong>feature </strong>on, they will need a face or fingerprint scan to do so. Apple also recently updated its “activation lock ” feature to make it harder for thieves to sell parts from stolen phones.</p>
<p>Android phones, meanwhile, can now use artificial intelligence (AI) to detect motion indicating someone took a device out of your hand and is racing away on foot or a bike. The program then locks the screen immediately. There is also a feature called Private Spaces that lets you hide sensitive files on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Write down your device number </strong></p>
<p>Take note of your phone's serial number, also known as an IMEI number. It can link you to the phone if it does eventually get recovered. Call it up by typing (asterisk)#06# on your phone's keypad. If you have already lost your phone you can also find it in other places like the box it came in.</p>
<p><strong>If the device is stolen </strong></p>
<p>If you are unlucky enough to have your phone stolen, notify police. Call your insurance company if you have a policy that covers the device. Inform your phone company so they can freeze your number and issue a replacement SIM card or eSIM. Notify your bank so they can watch out for unusual activity.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking your device </strong></p>
<p>Try to find your phone with the find my device feature. For iPhones, go to iCloud.com/find from a web browser. Android users should go to www.google.com/android/find. Samsung also has its own service for Galaxy phones.</p>
<p>These services will show your phone's current or last known location on a map. The service is also handy if you cannot find your phone somewhere in the house. Apple says even if a phone cannot connect to the internet or has been turned off, it can use Bluetooth to contact any nearby Apple devices by using the same network behind its AirTags tracking devices. Google says newer Pixel phones can be located “for several hours” after they have been turned off using similar technology.</p>
<p>You can get the phone to play a sound, even if it is on silent. You can also put the phone in lost mode, which locks it and displays a message and contact details on the screen for anyone who finds it. Lost mode on iOS also suspends any Apple Pay cards and passes.</p>
<p>If the device shows up in an unfamiliar location on the map, and you suspect it has been stolen, experts say it is better to contact police rather than trying to get it back yourself.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity company Norton says, “Confronting a thief yourself is not recommended.”</p>
<p><strong>Final steps </strong></p>
<p>If you cannot find your phone, there are some final steps to take.</p>
<p>Log yourself out of all your accounts that might be accessible on the phone. Then remove your phone from your list of trusted devices that you use to get <strong>multifactor authentication </strong>codes. But make sure you can get those codes somewhere else, such as email.</p>
<p>Then, as a final step, you can erase the phone remotely so that there is no chance of any data falling into the wrong hands. However, take note: Apple says that if the iPhone is offline, the remote erase will only happen the next time the phone comes back online. But if you find the phone before it gets erased, you can cancel the request.</p>
<p>Google warns that SD memory cards plugged into Android phones might not be remotely erased. And after the phone has been wiped, it will not show up with find my device.</p>

            <title>Japanese Ramen Restaurants Struggle to Keep Costs Down (2024/10/31)</title>

<p>Japanese ramen restaurants are famous for providing high-quality food at a reasonable price. But continuing inflation –particularly affecting food products and fuel – is making it difficult for ramen sellers to keep costs down.</p>
<p>One of those owners is 26-year-old Taisei Hikage. He opened a ramen restaurant in Tokyo about a year and a half ago. Hikage told Reuters he has already raised his food prices three times. The price for his top-selling “Special Ramen” is up 47 percent since he opened, now selling for $8.</p>
<p>But even after raising his prices, Hikage still struggles with rising costs. "Traditionally ramen shops were supposed to offer something <strong>cheap</strong> and tasty," he said. "It's no longer cheap food for the masses."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Ramen shop Menya Taisei's owner Taisei Hikage prepares to cook ramen with noodles at his shop in Tokyo, Japan, October 22, 2024.

<p>The issues facing Japanese ramen restaurants are similar to inflation-linked problems experienced by businesses around the world.</p>
<p>In Japan, it became a big campaign issue in the country's recent general election. Major political parties promised during the campaign to enact measures aimed at reducing rising business costs.</p>
<p>Hikage told Reuters that even though his prices have gone up sharply, his noodles are still in demand. Long lines form in front of his shop all day long.</p>
<p>Research by Japanese credit advisor Teikoku Databank shows that 49 Japanese ramen restaurant operators with large debts filed for bankruptcy in the first seven months of this year.</p>
<p>Rising import costs for businesses bringing goods into Japan have worsened the problem. In addition, the country's currency hit a 34-year low against the dollar this year and has struggled to rise again.</p>
<p>Experts told Reuters the issues facing Japan's ramen restaurants are part of wider economic difficulties in the country. Nationwide bankruptcies in one six-month period this year rose 18.6 percent over the same period last year to 4,990 cases, Teikoku Databank said. A record number of those were caused by inflation.</p>
<p>Toshihiro Nagahama is the chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. He told Reuters, "Just like ramen shops, companies offering goods and services that are in demand are <strong>transferring</strong> costs to product prices and seeing their sales grow.” But he noted that many businesses struggling to pass on higher costs are not making it.</p>
<p>For now, restaurant owner Hikage said he plans to keep centering on serving quality, tasty food and hopes the election result will lead to some business improvements.</p>

            <title>New Rice May Help Farmers in Japan Face Climate Change (2024/10/30)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 29 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Jill Robbins</span><br/><span class="datetime">29 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>In the Japanese village of Kamimomi, a small group of farmers began gathering their rice in extreme heat, two weeks earlier than usual.</p>
<p>Kamimomi is in Japan's western Okayama <strong>prefecture</strong>. The area is called "the Land of Sunshine" because of its good weather. But farmers working in the mountainside rice fields say climate change is hurting the harvest of rice.</p>
<p>Joji Terasaka farms in Okayama. He said last year a hot period dried up the rice. He added, "I am worried about that this year because it will be just as hot."</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A farmer operates a harvester machine on a rice terrace during harvest in Kamimomi village, Okayama prefecture, Japan on Sept. 7, 2024. (AP Photo/Ayaka McGill)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/05f6bf57-a4ad-4146-b23e-528b5c15db4a_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">A farmer operates a harvester machine on a rice terrace during harvest in Kamimomi village, Okayama prefecture, Japan on Sept. 7, 2024.

<p>This year Japan had its hottest July on record. The Japan weather agency said temperatures were 2.16 degrees Celsius higher than average. Worldwide, there has been a 1.2-degree Celsius rise in average temperature since 1850.</p>
<p>Scientists agreed that warming needs to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius to prevent the worst effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Last year, Japan had a poor rice harvest nationwide because of unusually hot weather.</p>
<p>Officials say the drop in harvest in Japan was partly responsible for a shortage of rice this summer. The low supply of rice in markets forced sellers to limit each buyer to one rice bag.</p>
<p>Yuji Masutomi is a researcher at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. He said, "Perhaps people think that an increase of one degree Celsius in average temperature isn't much. But it's quite a big change for plants and crops."</p>
<p>Masutomi said the rising temperatures also hurt the quality of the grain. Last year, the farming ministry noted that at least one-fifth of rice farms have reported a drop in quality from rising temperatures. "Not only is the appearance not good; people say the taste drops too," Masutomi said.</p>
<p>Another problem the farmers in Kamimomi face is working under high heat. The average age of agricultural workers in Japan is nearly 69, among the oldest in the world. Older people are especially likely to suffer from the heat. For half of the year, farmers work in the heat to produce rice.</p>
<p>To deal with climate change, the government is urging the use of heat-resistant <strong>varieties</strong> of rice. One <strong>strain</strong>, developed by a research center near Tokyo, is called Sai no Kizuna.</p>
<p>Naoto Ohoka manages rice <strong>breeding</strong> at Saitama's Agricultural Technology Research Center. Ohoka said, "Last year and this year have been extremely hot, but even in those conditions, Sai no Kizuna maintained a certain level of quality.”</p>
<p>Sai no Kizuna was developed in 2012 to better survive high heat, wind and certain pests and diseases. Masutomi recommends that similar varieties of rice should be introduced across Japan by the 2040s.</p>
<p>But it can take up to 10 years to develop a new strain. After it is approved for the market, farmers must then decide to grow it.</p>
<p>The most widely grown strain of rice is Koshihikari, which does not do well in high heat. Even so, older farmers have not always been willing to change to other varieties. Farming ministry data show that heat-resistant varieties grow in only around 15 percent of Japanese rice fields.</p>

            <title>Researchers Introduce Floating Drone to Transport Goods (2024/10/30)</title>

<p>South Korean researchers have developed a <strong>drone</strong> designed to stay level when transporting goods over many kinds of surfaces.</p>
<p>A team at Seoul National University of Science and Technology built a prototype, or test model of the drone. The team recently demonstrated the aircraft for reporters from Reuters.</p>
<p>The prototype has a transport carrier attached to a drone structure. It is supported by several <strong>propellers</strong> and <strong>rotors</strong> that control its height, speed and direction in the air. The aircraft has a <strong>handle </strong>workers can push to guide it where it needs to go.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Park Hyun-geun, a graduate student of Mechanical Design and Robot Engineering at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, demonstrates the transporter drone in Seoul, South Korea, October 10, 2024.

<p>Members of the development team showed how the drone can keep itself level while floating, even when transporting goods up or down stairs. Leaders of the research say the drone is programmed to predict human actions for effective interactions.</p>

</span>
<p>Lee Seung-jae is a professor of mechanical system design engineering at Seoul National University of Science and Technology. He was a leader of the project. The research results appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10563997">in a study</a> in <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</em>. The publication is part of the <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a>, based in New York.</p>
<p>Lee told Reuters tests of the drone showed it could transport objects up to 3 kilograms. He admitted this weight restriction likely limits the drone's use cases for many businesses. But he noted that the transporter's design and operating equipment could be used to create a series of other kinds of drone vehicles.</p>
<p>Lee said one example would be to use the transporter to carry sensitive or breakable materials. The technology could also be used to develop “flying taxis” to transport humans, he added.</p>
<p>When used in a flying taxi, Lee said the drones could be used to change <strong>batteries</strong> while still flying in the air, instead of having to return to a ground station for recharging.</p>
<p>In general, experts say drones with multiple propellers are easier to control and move in many different settings. But they are also slower and cannot travel as far on a battery charge.</p>
<p>Drones with multiple rotors have already been used to transport small amounts of goods, food and medical supplies. But experts say it is difficult to widely expand use of such drones for <strong>commercial</strong> purposes. This is because such activities would require larger batteries a smaller aircraft could not support.</p>

            <title>Program Trains Black Male Teachers for Preschools (2024/10/30)</title>

<p>The Leading Men Fellowship trains young Black and Latino men to become early <strong>literacy</strong> teachers in preschool classrooms across the United States.</p>
<p>The program aims to deal with several problems at the same time. First, officials say there is a shortage of educators for preschoolers. Another problem is there are few Black and Latino male teachers. And there are many problems that boys face in schools because of their race and sex.</p>
<p>Ivan Douglas is with the Literacy Lab based in Washington, D.C. It is a nonprofit group that operates the Leading Men Fellowship, which started in 2016.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="Leading Men fellow Davontez Johnson, right, high-fives preschooler Kodi during a name writing exercise, Thursday, Oct. 3, 2024, at Dorothy I. Height Elementary School in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/eb726042-6bc2-4a40-bce5-39a9c20c8ce0_cx0_cy7_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Douglas said, “We're not only affecting change in the classroom with these school students, but (we're) also developing these young future educators.”</p>
<p>One of the fellows in the program is Davontez Johnson. He is 19 years old and is currently gaining experience in a preschool at Dorothy I. Heights Elementary in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>Fellows like Johnson are <strong>recruited</strong> after they finish high school. After a summer of intensive training, they go to work in school earning between $16.50 and $18 an hour.</p>
<p>Johnson is unusual. He is a former high school offensive lineman in American football. It is a position held by the biggest players on the team. Some parents say he looks out of place in a classroom.</p>
<p>Federal government information says that less than one percent of elementary and early education schoolteachers are Black men.</p>
<p>Johnson said that is part of the reason he wanted to teach preschoolers.</p>
<p>“I really thought it was a great opportunity. Because I know if I saw someone like me, you know, in pre-K, I'd be pretty excited,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><strong>Black teachers can help Black students</strong></p>
<p>The Associated Press (AP) recently reported on the Leading Men Fellowship. The AP says there is growing evidence that Black teachers can help Black students—especially boys. For example, boys are more likely than girls to be expelled from school.</p>
<p>Some people are saying that having teachers of the same race is important for young Americans. The AP says there is research showing Black students who have at least one Black teacher are more likely to graduate from high school and less likely to get suspended or expelled.</p>
<p>The AP says research suggests that training found at historically Black colleges might be part of developing an effective teacher. A recent study of elementary school students in North Carolina, for example, said Black students performed better in math when taught by a teacher trained at an HBCU, or a historically black college or university.</p>
<p>Nicholas Papageorge is an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He said his research shows that Black teachers have higher expectations of Black students than non-Black teachers. His research also suggests that Black students who have a Black teacher are less likely to drop out of high school and more likely to attend college.</p>
<p><strong>The preschool classroom </strong></p>
<p>Leading Men fellow Johnson has found that singing and dancing are a big part of preschool education. He has been told that children learn best through repetition and when they can link information with movements and music.</p>
<p>Bridget Jeffreys has Johnson working in her preschool classroom. She said she has been watching Johnson grow more <strong>confident</strong> with her students. “It was so beautiful because usually you don't see men really get down to the child level,” Jeffreys said. She said the children see him as a “big kid.”</p>
<p>Johnson is also studying political science at the University of Maryland Global Campus. He hopes to go into politics. But at this time, his fellow teachers want him to <strong>stick with</strong> teaching.</p>
<p>On a recent October day, Johnson worked individually with students to help them write their names. During free-play time, he helped a student who was making an impression of a leaf on paper.</p>
<p>She looked to him for approval and support for her work.</p>
<p>“You've done a wonderful job,” Johnson told her.</p>

<p>Scientists in Colombia say they have developed a new food substance that protects bees from dangerous chemicals used in farming. They claim it will protect the insects' brains from <strong>neurological</strong> damage caused by chemicals called <strong>pesticides</strong>.</p>
<p>As <strong>pollinators</strong>, bees are extremely important in the <strong>preservation</strong> of natural <strong>ecosystems</strong> and food production.</p>
<p>The plant-based food substance enables bees to deal with neurotoxins commonly used in agriculture. It protects their <strong>motor </strong>system and memory harmed by the chemicals.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Bees from the apiary of the Universidad del Rosario are raised for the research of the formula to protect the brain of bees and other pollinators affected by exposure to insecticides, Bogota, Colombia, October 17, 2024.

(REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez)</span></div>
<p>Researchers at Colombia's Rosario University in Bogota developed the substance. They partnered with scientists from the Colombian Universidad Javeriana and the University of Arizona in the United States.</p>
<p>"This is a nutritional solution to the problem bees face when <strong>exposed </strong>to pesticides," said Andre Riveros, a professor at Rosario University. Riveros explained that the food substance causes the bees to develop protection against pesticides.</p>
<p>The substance is created with flavonoids, which are known for their health benefits. Flavonoids come from plants and are a kind of secondary metabolite. Secondary metabolites are substances made by plants that make them competitive in their environment.</p>
<p>During the first round of testing, scientists put the bees to sleep and placed them into small laboratory tubes. Then, they fed the bees the substance one by one.</p>
<p>Testing has now moved to real-world situations in a bee colony at the university, said Juan Jose Ovalle. He is a natural science student at Rosario University.</p>
<p>"We already know that there are molecules that improve the bees' health. We already know that there are molecules that prevent neuronal damage caused by pesticides," Ovalle said.</p>
<p>He added it was important to continue the work to increase the effectiveness of these methods to support bees.</p>

<p>“No pain, no gain” is an old saying in English. It means that one has to suffer or work hard in order to succeed or make progress.</p>
<p>The expression is now often used to push people to train harder or exercise more to get good effects.</p>
<p>But just how much pain do you have to have from weight training?

<p>For years, some trainers have told people that to get the best results, they need to train “until failure.”</p>
<p>Training “until failure” means that you do an exercise until you cannot do one more <strong>repetition</strong>. Some recent studies, however, suggest training “until failure” with weights may only help some people.</p>
<p>“If somebody wants to increase muscle mass as much as they possibly can, then training to failure is something to consider,” said Michael Zourdos of Florida Atlantic University.</p>
<p>Zourdos co-wrote a review of 55 research papers on the subject in the scientific publication <em>Sports Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>Zourdos and <strong>colleagues</strong> found that lifting weights “until failure” may build bigger muscles. But training in such a way is not needed to increase strength. He said people who work out hard, but do not push themselves to <strong>exhaustion</strong>, will still likely make their health and fitness better. “There is a difference between training for health and training for <strong>elite</strong> performance <strong>benefits</strong>,” he said.</p>
<p>For the average person simply looking to increase their fitness levels, Zourdos said it is much easier to get results. He explained people who work out regularly would benefit from an intense session that comes within five to 10 repetitions of failure.</p>
<p>He also said “failure training” often comes at a cost. People who train until failure might be so tired and in so much pain that they skip their next workout or two.</p>
<p>In rare cases, extremely difficult training can even be harmful. One example is the condition called rhabdomyolysis, where damaged muscles begin to break down, possibly causing kidney damage.</p>
<p>James Fisher is a sport science expert and advisor in Southampton, England. He said many people are not interested in the idea of working until complete exhaustion.</p>
<p>“What we're really talking about is how hard you should work when you go to the <strong>gym</strong>,” he said.</p>
<p>Fisher added that the idea should be understood to mean that people can spend less time in the gym — if they work hard.</p>
<p>“If you're short on time, then you can push yourself harder, and then you don't need to work out as long,” he said.</p>
<p>Fisher explained that to increase strength, it is necessary to push your muscles to a certain level.</p>
<p>“If you lift a weight you can easily lift ten times or more, you never really work hard enough,” he said. “Now, if we increase the weight so that on the ninth and 10th rep, it feels ... hard, that will benefit your muscle...”</p>
<p>Still, Fisher said that the best workout is “one that people will actually do,” regardless of how hard they push themselves. He said that strength training is probably the best single thing people can do for their health, quality of life and <strong>longevity</strong>.</p>
<p>Whatever your fitness goal, Fisher said the idea of failure training can be included into your workout. People should then rest the muscle group they have trained for about two days, he said.</p>
<p>For people who have more experience, experts suggest saving the failure training for some of the workouts, or on the last set of exercises in your session.</p>
<p>“It's not meant to be for every person, every time they work out,” Fisher said. “This is a tough way to exercise.”</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 27 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">27 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Astronomers have made a surprising discovery about the first brown dwarf ever identified. New observations suggest the object is actually two brown dwarfs orbiting each other.</p>
<p>The American space agency NASA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-identifies-tiniest-free-floating-brown-dwarf/">describes</a> a brown dwarf as an object that “<strong>straddles</strong> the dividing line between stars and planets.”</p>
<p>Brown dwarfs form like stars. This means they can grow dense and hot enough to collapse under their own gravity. But they never grow dense or hot enough to begin the process of <strong>nuclear fusion</strong> needed to turn into a star, NASA said. Because of this, brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This illustration provided by Caltech depicts the orbits of brown dwarf twins, Gliese 229Ba and Gliese 229Bb, The pair of stars orbits a cool M-dwarf star every 250 years.

(K. Miller, R. Hurt/Caltech/IPAC)</span></div>
<p>Many brown dwarfs are similar to gas giant planets and weigh just a few times more than the mass of Jupiter. Others can be much larger.</p>
<p>The first brown dwarf was discovered in 1995 by researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The discovery was made with the help of the institute's Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California.</p>
<p>But after many years of studying the object, known as Gliese 229B, scientists wondered why its brightness was less than expected for an object of its size.</p>
<p>New research now shows that the brown dwarf is actually two objects. The observations came from the Very Large Telescope, which sits in a desert area of northern Chile. Those observations showed that one of the brown dwarfs is about 38 times the mass of Jupiter, while the other is 34 times Jupiter's mass.</p>
<p>In a statement, the researchers said data collected by the telescope suggests the two objects orbit each other every 12 days. That is less than half the time it takes for the moon to orbit the Earth. “The observed brightness levels of the pair match what is expected for two small <strong>dim</strong> brown dwarfs in this mass <strong>range</strong>,” the statement added.</p>
<p>The two brown dwarfs are gravitationally linked to each other in what is known as a binary system. Such a situation is commonly observed among stars but is rare for brown dwarfs.</p>
<p>After the new discovery, the two objects were given new names – Gliese 229Ba and Gliese 229Bb. The brown dwarfs are believed to orbit a star called a red dwarf. The two sit about 19 light-years away from our solar system. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers.</p>
<p>The research was co-led by Jerry Xuan, a graduate student at Caltech. He said in a statement that Gliese 229B was always considered “the <strong>poster child</strong>” for a brown dwarf.</p>
<p>"And now we know we were wrong all along about the nature of the object,” he added. “It's not one but two. We just weren't able to <strong>probe </strong>separations this close until now."</p>
<p>Astronomers had identified brown dwarf pairs before, but never any that orbited each other so closely. The research results recently appeared <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08064-x">in a study</a> in the publication <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The team that discovered Gliese 229B in 1995 included Rebecca Oppenheimer. At the time, she was a Caltech graduate student. She is now an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. She was also a member of the latest research team.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer said, “It shows you how <strong>weird</strong> the universe is, and how different solar systems are from our own.” She added that she sees the new finding as “the most exciting and <strong>fascinating</strong> discovery” in this area of astrophysics in many years.</p>
<p>Caltech's Jerry Xuan said the discovery suggests there might be other brown dwarfs closely orbiting each other. He added that he hopes the latest finding can lead to a greater understanding of brown dwarf development.</p>
<p>"We still don't really know how different brown dwarfs form, and what the <strong>transition</strong> between a giant planet and a brown dwarf is,” Xuan said.</p>
<p>He added, “This goes to show how complex and <strong>messy</strong> the star formation process is. We should always be open to surprises."</p>

            <title>US Agency Issues Final Rules for Flying Air Taxis (2024/10/27)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Bryan Lynn</span><br/><span class="datetime">26 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>The U.S. government has issued final rules for operating air taxis. It has also set training and approval requirements for pilots.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced the new rules. They were announced October 22.</p>
<p>The FAA <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis">explains</a> that air taxis belong to a kind of aircraft known as Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) flyers. These aircraft are generally highly <strong>automated</strong> and electrically powered. They also have <strong>vertical</strong> take-off and landing abilities, the agency said.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This file images shows an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, flying above the Joby eVTOL aircraft, during a demonstration of eVTOLs Nov. 13, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/429dbd2a-32f7-4136-9075-7c488652775f_cx0_cy4_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This file images shows an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, flying above the Joby eVTOL aircraft, during a demonstration of eVTOLs Nov. 13, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)</span></div>
<p>Air taxis are part of the AAM group, or category. But they are also considered “power-lift” vehicles. The aircraft have elements of both airplanes and helicopters, the FAA said. Other power-lift vehicles are designed to transport goods rather than people.</p>
<p>These aircraft take off and land vertically but can fly like fixed-wing planes. Many companies have designed and built such models and are working to get them to market. But the efforts have been delayed because of a lack of final requirements, or regulations, governing their use.</p>
<p>FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said powered-lift aircraft represent “the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years.” He added that the new rules are meant to <strong>open the door</strong> to supporting widespread AAM operations in the U.S. in the future.</p>
<p>Whitaker said the new rules aim to make sure “this new generation of aircraft <strong>maintain</strong> the high level of safety that defines modern aviation.” The goal is to establish requirements to ensure that AAMs “are able to safely operate in our National Airspace System alongside existing aircraft.”</p>
<p>The FAA has said air taxi operations will begin slowly. In the beginning, air taxis will use existing travel paths and landing structures currently used by helicopters. The new rules will permit pilots to train with a single set of flight controls. Past FAA rules required two flight controls – one for the student and one for the flight <strong>instructor</strong>.</p>
<p>Air taxi supporters call the aircraft a cleaner choice compared to passenger airplanes, which burn jet fuel. Supporters have called for widespread expansion of the flyers beginning as early as 2025. But experts say current technology limitations make it likely air taxis will only be able to operate at first in large cities.</p>
<p>One company developing AAMs is California-based Joby Aviation. It praised the new FAA rules. Company chief JoeBen Bevirt said the rules “will ensure the U.S. continues to play a global leadership role in the development and <strong>adoption</strong> of clean flight.”</p>
<p>Some airline companies have said they see air taxis as a way to transport passengers to airports. In 2022, Delta Air Lines said it would invest $60 million in Joby. And this month, Toyota announced a $500 million investment in the company. United Airlines is backing another California-based company, Archer Aviation. The Associated Press reports that United has ordered 200 aircraft, which Archer said could be worth up to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Former acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen is currently Archer's chief safety officer. He told the Reuters news agency that the new FAA rules represent a big step forward for the future deployment of flying air taxis.</p>
<p>"Now we've got a roadmap," Nolen said.</p>

            <title>Exploring the 'Butterfly Effect' (2024/10/27)</title>
            <pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content"><span class="byline">By Anna Matteo</span><br/><span class="datetime">26 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>And now, <em>Words and Their Stories, </em>from VOA Learning English.</p>
<p>Butterflies are <strong>delicate</strong> insects. Their wings are thin and can be easily damaged. So, how can a butterfly cause major things to happen?</p>
<p>That is the idea behind the expression <u>butterfly effect.</u></p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - This August 19, 2015, photo shows a monarch butterfly landing on a flower in Vista, California. (AP File Photo/Gregory Bull)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/16F8E90F-DF91-462D-9A6F-826A25794F3C_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">FILE - This August 19, 2015, photo shows a monarch butterfly landing on a flower in Vista, California. (AP File Photo/Gregory Bull)</span></div>
<p>The theory goes like this: When a butterfly <strong>flaps</strong> its wings on one side of the planet it can make a small change that, over time, could lead to a big event, like a storm, all the way on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>The <u>butterfly effect</u> is when very small changes lead to large and unpredictable changes in the future.</p>
<p><em>For example, let's say a group of television writers demand higher pay. Their employers refuse. So, the writers go on strike. Then television actors join the strike. Their action forces the television industry to stop production. Then, other businesses that support that industry are affected and so are the towns and communities where those businesses are centered. These changes all resulted from that first demand for higher pay.</em></p>
<p>A similar expression involves the game of dominoes -- the <u>domino effect</u>.</p>
<p>Dominoes are small rectangular game pieces. One way to play with dominoes is to set them up in a line or pattern. Then you push the domino at the start of the line into the one next to it and so on and so on ... until all the dominos fall down. You started the <u>domino effect</u> with your single push of a single domino.</p>
<p>The <u>butterfly effect</u> and <u>domino effect</u> are <u>chain reactions</u>. One thing leads to another. We often say that something sets off a <u>chain reaction</u>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><em>The angry argument between the two friends set off a <u>chain reaction</u> of events that no one could have predicted. One thing led to another and now they are enemies. </em></p>
<p>You can also call this a <u>chain of events</u>. Like <u>butterfly effect</u> and <u>domino effect</u>, one event causes, or <strong>triggers,</strong> the next one to happen.</p>
<p>Now, let's hear two friends use some of these expressions:</p>
<p><em>A: Hey, I'm having the official opening for my bookstore this weekend. You should stop by.</em></p>
<p><em>B: I will! And congratulations. You've been working on that for a while. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Nearly a year. There are so many steps in starting a business. </em></p>
<p><em>B: How did you begin?</em></p>
<p><em>A: It was a <u>domino effect</u>. As soon as I finished the first thing, the next thing to do became clear, and the next and the next. </em></p>
<p><em>B: Sounds like starting that <u>chain of events</u> was important.</em></p>
<p><em>A: Absolutely.</em></p>
<p><em>B: As a writer, did you always want to own a bookstore? </em></p>
<p><em>A: It's funny you ask. When I was little, my friend's parents owned a bookstore. I'd hang out there for hours!</em></p>
<p><em>B: It's like the <u>butterfly effect</u>. Something that happened a long time ago, affected your future today. </em></p>
<p><em>A: Hmm, that sounds like a good story to write. </em></p>
<p>And that's <em>Words and Their Stories</em>.</p>

            <title>Halloween in America: Costumes, Candy, Costs for Night of Fright (2024/10/26)</title>
            <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>October 31 is Halloween. But many Americans have been preparing for the holiday for weeks. And businesses are hoping for good profits from Halloween purchases.</p>
<p>The National Retail Federation (N.R.F.) is the largest U.S. trade group representing sellers of material goods. It expects total Halloween spending in 2024 to reach about $11.6 billion. That sounds like a healthy amount, but it would be a drop from the year before. The N.R.F. says total Halloween spending in 2023 was a record-setting $12.2 billion.</p>
<p>So, you might wonder: What are Americans buying for Halloween and how do they celebrate the holiday?</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A towering Halloween human skeleton appears with a giant canine skeleton in front of a house in Westchester County, N.Y., on Sept. 23, 2024.

<p>Halloween traditions in America are linked to Celtic beliefs in ancient Britain. The Celts believed that spirits of the dead would return to their homes on October 31, the day of the autumn feast. Celts would build huge fires to frighten away any evil spirits that might return.</p>
<p>People from Scotland and Ireland brought these ideas with them when they came to America. Some believed that spirits played tricks on people on the last night of October.</p>
<p>In modern America, the holiday mostly belongs to children. After dark, children wear special clothing, called costumes. They often appear as frightening creatures like vampires, ghosts and witches. The children walk around their neighborhoods, <strong>knocking</strong> on doors of homes. When someone answers a door, the children yell “trick or treat.” If the people in the homes do not give them a sweet treat, the children may play a trick on them.</p>
<p>Some of the purchases people make for Halloween include candy and costumes. This year, the N.R.F. expects the superhero character Spider-Man to be the most popular children's costume.</p>
<p>Children are not the only Americans in costumes on Halloween, however. Adults also dress up in costumes and attend Halloween parties, parades and other events. These celebrations often include costume competitions, with prizes for the most frightening, inventive or humorous costumes.</p>
<p>Overall, the N.R.F. reports, total spending on costumes for Halloween 2024 is expected to reach a total of $3.8 billion. It says buyers will spend $3.5 billion on Halloween candy.</p>
<p>Americans also enjoy<strong> decorating</strong> their homes for Halloween.</p>
<p>People hang <strong>fake</strong> skeletons, witches, spiders and other scary things around their doors and from trees and bushes. They also cut scary faces into pumpkins and light them to create a strange <strong>glow</strong>.</p>
<p>Some people do a little decorating, others do a lot, and still others do none at all. But, the N.R.F. says researchers estimate Americans will spend about $3.8 billion dollars to dress up their houses for Halloween this year.</p>

<p>Hello! This week on <em>Ask a Teacher</em>, we answer a question from Hoang in Vietnam about how to think in English.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Dear Teacher,</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/3ae349fb-f634-471c-a1a6-86f1808061e0_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>People say that to speak English <strong>fluently</strong>, you need to think in English. So how can I think in English faster? When I talk with foreigners...with the first <strong>conversation</strong>, I talk very slowly and the remaining time I use for thinking. And with the second conversation (because I've been talking before), I feel natural and I speak more fluently.</p>
<p>So how can I be fluent like the second conversation when I'm having the first conversation?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Hoang</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>I'm happy to answer this question, Hoang.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to fully explain how to think in a foreign language. That is because the explanation asks us to consider the relationship between thoughts and the language we use to express them.</p>
<p>However, we can still notice what happens when we think in a foreign language. And we can compare it to times when we have to <strong>pause</strong> and <strong>translate</strong> from our native language.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when you exchange simple greetings, questions, and answers in a foreign language. If someone asks you in English, “How are you today?” you can probably answer without pausing or translating from your native language. For example, you can quickly reply, “I'm fine, thank you. And how are you?”</p>
<p>This example shows us the basic things we need for thinking in a foreign language. In this situation, you know all the words you need to say. You don't need to stop and think about the grammar. And you have heard and said these phrases so many times that your response is <strong>automatic</strong>.</p>
<p>The reason the second conversation you talk about feels more natural is because you have already heard and used some of the <strong>vocabulary</strong> and grammar you need. So, for any subject you want to discuss, you will be able to think in English after you have learned and practiced what you need to say many times.</p>
<p><strong>Steps for thinking in English</strong></p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for learning to think in English:</p>
<p>Choose a subject you are interested in discussing. Then, imagine you are speaking with another person. How easily and quickly can your mind find the vocabulary and grammar you need? Note when you need to pause to find vocabulary or think about grammar. Next, learn the vocabulary and grammar and then practice using them several times. Repeat the words until they become automatic.</p>
<p>If you can plan ahead and practice in your mind what you will likely talk about, then your first conversation might feel easier and similar to a second conversation.</p>
<p>You can find more advice for thinking in English in our <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/train-your-mind-to-think-in-english/5023664.html"><em>Education Tips</em> article, “Train Your Brain to Think in English.”</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that, to think in English, you need to read, listen to, and speak as much English as possible. This will help your mind use English more easily.</p>
<p>For our readers and listeners, what are your questions about American English? We'd like to hear from you. Send us an email at <a class="wsw__a" href="21voa.com">21voa.com</a>. And please include where you are from in your email, too.</p>

            <title>Polio Rises in Pakistan Ahead of a New Vaccination Campaign (2024/10/25)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/polio-rises-in-pakistan-ahead-of-a-new-vaccination-campaign.mp3"/>

<p>In Pakistan, polio cases are rising ahead of a new vaccination campaign. Violence targeting health workers has also hurt years of efforts toward making the country polio-free.</p>
<p>The <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/poliomyelitis">World Health Organization says</a> polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. The disease largely affects children under age five. The virus is <strong>transmitted</strong> from person to person and spread mainly through contact. It invades the nervous system and causes a person to be unable to move arms, legs or muscles, a condition called paralysis. Among those paralyzed, up to 10 percent die when their breathing muscles become <strong>immobilized</strong>.</p>
<p>Since January, health officials have confirmed 39 new polio cases in Pakistan, compared to only six last year, said Anwarul Haq. He is with the National Emergency Operation Center for Polio Eradication. Eradication means getting rid of something completely.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A police officer stands guard as a health worker, right, gives a polio vaccine to a child in a neighborhood of Peshawar, Pakistan, September 9, 2024.

(AP Photo/Muhammad Sajjad)</span></div>
<p>The new nationwide campaign starts on October 28. The campaign aims to vaccinate<strong> </strong>at least 32 million children.</p>
<p>“The whole purpose of these campaigns is to achieve the target of making Pakistan a polio-free state,” Haq said.</p>
<p>Pakistan regularly launches campaigns against polio despite attacks on the workers and police assigned to protect them.</p>
<p>Militants falsely claim that the vaccination campaigns are a Western attempt to<strong> </strong>sterilize<strong> </strong>children. To sterilize means to make someone unable to produce children.</p>
<p>Most of the new polio cases were reported in the southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh <strong>provinces</strong>. The next two areas with the most cases are Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and eastern Punjab.</p>
<p>The <strong>locations</strong> worry officials since previous cases were from the northwest areas bordering Afghanistan. In September, this is where the Taliban government suddenly stopped a house-to-house vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>Afghanistan and Pakistan are the two countries in which the spread of the possibly deadly, paralyzing disease has never been eradicated. Officials in Pakistan have said that the Taliban's decision will have major effects beyond the Afghan border. People from both sides frequently travel to each other's country.</p>
<p>The WHO has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year. All but two of these cases were in the south of the country. That number is up from six cases in 2023.</p>
<p>In June, Afghanistan started a house-to-house vaccination campaign for the first time in five years. The campaign has helped to reach the majority of children targeted, officials at the WHO said.</p>
<p>Health officials in Pakistan say they want both sides to hold anti-polio campaigns at the same time.</p>

            <title>Finally, a World Series for Baseball (2024/10/25)</title>
            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>Baseball has long called its championship the World Series although it only involves teams playing in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It started in 1903 when the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League beat the Boston Americans of the American League for the championship. But the first official World Series, as it is known today, was in 1905 between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Athletics.</p>
<p>Since then, the New York Yankees have won 27 World Series titles, more than any other team. This year, the Yankees will face the Los Angeles Dodgers for what sports fans believe will be a World Series seen around the world.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani celebrates after their win against the New York Mets in Game 6 of a baseball NL Championship Series, Sunday, Oct. 20, 2024, in Los Angeles.

</span></div>
<p>The competition is a best-of-seven-game championship. That means four wins in the series are needed to become the champion.</p>
<p>This year's series might have everything that sports fans could want. It is a competition between teams from the two largest cities in the U.S. It is a competition between the two best teams in baseball. And the contest involves two of the biggest baseball stars, Shohei Ohtani of Japan and Aaron Judge of the U.S.</p>
<p>Both players have already won the Most Valuable Player Award or MVP, given to the best player in the National League and the American League. Ohtani has won it twice and Judge once. The two are likely to be named MVP in each league again this year.</p>
<p>Ohtani joined the Dodgers earlier this year with a record 10-year <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.21voa.com/a/japan-s-ohtani-gets-700-million-biggest-team-sports-deal/7393301.html">contract valued at $700 million</a>. After receiving the largest contract ever in team sports history, Ohtani hit 54 <strong>home runs</strong>, <strong>stole</strong> 59 <strong>bases</strong>, and led the National League in almost all offensive numbers.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters on Tuesday, October 22, Judge called Ohtani “the best player in the game.” He added that Ohtani “hits for average, he hits for power, the speed.”</p>
<p>But Judge himself holds the American League record with 62 home runs in 2022. This year, he leads all of baseball, hitting 58 home runs. And he also leads all of baseball, both American and National Leagues, in offensive numbers, including 144 <strong>RBIs</strong>, 133 <strong>walks</strong>, on-base percentage, and <strong>slugging percentage</strong>.</p>
<p>As expected, Ohtani led the Dodgers to the best record in the National League, and Judge captained the Yankees to the best record in the American League. The two best players, though, have a lot of help.</p>
<p>The Dodgers have two former MVPs, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, in the <strong>lineup</strong>. The Yankees have just one former MVP in Giancarlo Stanton. But they also have Juan Soto of the Dominican Republic, who is often called a “generational <strong>talent</strong>” in the game.</p>
<p>The first game of the 2024 World Series will start on Friday, October 25. The games are sold out meaning all tickets have been sold. But, for those who still want to watch the game in person, it is possible to pay more than $1,000 for a seat or up to $10,000 for the best seats in the reselling market StubHub.</p>
<p>Others can watch the television broadcast that is expected to set a record for people watching in Ohtani's home country of Japan.</p>
<p>After the Dodgers beat the New York Mets to get to the World Series, Ohtani told reporters, “The goal was to get this far.”</p>
<p>As for Judge, “getting a chance to play on the biggest stage and in the biggest moment, I think that's going to be pretty cool to watch,” he said.</p>

            <title>Grammar and Halloween (2024/10/25)</title>

<p>An interesting holiday in the United States is coming up soon. Halloween happens on the last day of October. If you have lived in the U.S., you have probably noticed many changes in the month or so before Halloween. Let's hear about some of them and explore the vocabulary and expressions you might hear this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>‘Trick-or-treat'</strong></p>
<p>First, you should know about trick-or-treating. Children <strong>dress</strong> <strong>up</strong> in special clothes, or costumes, to look like frightening creatures. They might dress up as little <strong>vampires</strong>, <strong>ghosts</strong> and <strong>witches </strong>or superheroes. Then their parents walk with them to the homes of neighbors, where the children knock at the door and call out, “Trick or treat!”</p><div class="contentImage"><img src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/01000000-0a00-0242-4cc8-08dbd581255f_w268_r1.png"/></div>
<p>Some people believe the custom goes back to an old Celtic celebration in which people went from door to door asking for firewood. The Celts believed that the spirits of the dead would return to their homes on October 31, the day of the autumn feast. The Celts would build large fires to frighten away evil spirits on that night.</p>
<p>In modern-day Halloween, the children ask for candy. That's the “treat” part. The “trick” part is what happens if you do not give them something.</p>
<p>Before Halloween, communities might create a “<strong>haunted</strong> house” in an old house or an open field. Visitors can walk through the place and be frightened and surprised by unusual noises and people dressed up like ghosts or spirits.</p>
<p>Fear plays a big part in Halloween celebrations. The words we use to talk about fear include “scary,” an adjective to show something causes fear and “afraid” an adjective that describes the person who feels fear. We might say, “I'm scared of ghosts,” to say we are afraid of ghosts.</p>
<p>Another word we use to describe things that cause fear is “<strong>spooky</strong>.” Little people trying to look like ghosts might say, “Boo!” to frighten others. Let's put some of these expressions together to see how they work.</p>
<p><em>Greg has a really scary costume this year. He said “Boo!” to me and I jumped!</em></p>
<p><em>Caty's house looks really spooky with all those skeletons and spider webs that she put out in her yard.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm not afraid of ghosts but seeing people dressed up as witches scares me!</em></p>
<p>You will see that stores begin offering many kinds of candies in small packages. We call these “individually wrapped” treats. They are meant for handing out to children as part of trick-or-treating. Some candy makers call these small packages “fun-sized” treats.</p>
<p><strong>Halloween decorations</strong></p>
<p>People put some strange things on and around their homes for Halloween. People hang toy spiders, skeletons and other scary <strong>decorations</strong> on trees and bushes. You will see pumpkins everywhere. People often empty the pumpkins and make scary faces on them. Then they place a candle inside so the pumpkin face shines in the night. We call these “jack-o-lanterns.”</p>
<p>The custom of carving scary faces into vegetables is believed to come to us from the Irish. They had an old story about a wandering soul named Stingy Jack. They carved faces in turnips to frighten him away. When they came to America, they found the pumpkin was widely available. So, they carved faces into pumpkins, and made what we call the jack-o-lantern today. Now, children carry plastic buckets made to look like a carved pumpkin. They fill them with candy as they trick-or-treat around their neighborhood.</p>
<p>We close with a usual conversation around Halloween in the U.S. See how many traditions and customs you can spot.</p>
<p><em>A: Are you going to any Halloween parties this year?</em></p>
<p><em>B: No, I have to take my kids trick-or-treating. Then I'm too tired to dress up and go out to a party. Are you going?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Yes, I'm going to be a vampire this year. My block has a great party with a haunted house every year.</em></p>
<p><em>B: Oh, I wish I could go. Hey, will you help me carve these pumpkins? I want to put them out front.<br/>
B: Sure, I love carving jack-o-lanterns. Can I have some of that candy while I'm working?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Of course. Help yourself to those fun-sized Hershey bars. I only have a hundred of them.</em></p>
<p>Does your culture have any celebrations where you dress up or give out treats? Write to us in the comments to tell us about them!</p>
<p>And that's Everyday Grammar for Halloween. Boo!</p>

            <title>Caribbean Island of Anguilla Gets Big Lift from AI (2024/10/24)</title>
            <pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            <enclosure type="audio/mpeg" url="https://files.21voa.com/audio/202410/caribbean-island-of-anguilla-gets-big-lift-from-ai.mp3"/>

<p class="Body">The Caribbean island of Anguilla is getting a economic lift from companies registering internet addresses through the British territory.</p>
<p class="Body">The companies are seeking to show they are involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. One way to do this is to secure an internet address that ends in .ai. Anguilla owns the right to issue the .ai <strong>domain</strong> ending to organizations. It gained that right in the 1990s, based on the territory's name.</p>
<p class="Body">Other nations and territories have similar control over domain registrations with letters with links to their name. For Anguilla, the popular rise of AI has permitted the territory to make a lot of money from new registrations ending in .ai.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="This file photos shows a ChapGPT logo on a smartphone in West Chester, Pa., Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)" src="https://files.21voa.com/gdb/2f8a8a9e-980e-40ce-bb27-192e06483703_cx0_cy2_cw0_w268_r1.jpg"/><br/><span class="imagecaption">This file photos shows a ChapGPT logo on a smartphone in West Chester, Pa., Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)</span></div>
<p class="Body">Some examples from the technology world include Google, which uses google.ai for its AI offerings. The chief of social media service X, Elon Musk, chose to register x.ai as the homepage for X‘s Grok AI tool. And AI search engine Perplexity uses perplexity.ai.</p>
<p class="Body">In Anguilla, earnings from web domain registration increased by four times last year to $32 million as the rise in AI systems increased sharply. The earnings now account for about 20 percent of the total amount the government brings in. Before the increased interest in AI, the amount remained at about five percent.</p>
<p class="Body">Anguilla's government – which uses the gov.ai domain – collects money each time an .ai web address is re-registered. It also gets paid when new addresses are registered and <strong>expired</strong> ones are sold off to new buyers. Some registrations have brought in tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="Body">Anguilla is 91 square kilometers and has a population of about 16,000. Its ocean areas and natural offerings bring in foreign visitors. But the island has faced economic difficulties since the COVID-19 pandemic, and it can be hit by powerful storms.</p>
<p class="Body">Anguilla does not have its own AI industry. But the territory's premier, Ellis Webster, hopes that will one day change. He told the Associated Press it was just luck that Anguilla was <strong>assigned</strong> the .ai domain. It could also have gone to nearby Antigua, which has the same letters in its name.</p>
<p class="Body">Webster said the money from domain registrations eases pressure on government finances and helps support several important projects. But, he said the territory must be careful not to completely depend on it.</p>
<p class="Body">“You can't predict how long this is going to last,” Webster told the AP. “So I don't want to have our economy and our country and all our programs just based on this.“</p>
<p class="Body">To help keep up with the explosive growth in .ai registrations, Anguilla signed a deal with a U.S.-based company, Identity Digital, to <strong>manage</strong> the process. The company has said it plans to add all .ai domain services to its systems by the start of next year.</p>
<p class="Body">There are currently more than 533,000 .ai web domains, an increase of more than 10 times since 2018. Webster predicts domain-related earnings will keep rising, possibly even doubling this year from last year's $32 million.</p>
<p class="Body">He noted the money can finance the expansion of the territory's airport, provide free medical care for older citizens and complete a technology job training center for high school students.</p>
<p class="Body">The income also provides “budget support” for other projects the government plans to launch, Webster said. One of those is a national development program that includes money for hurricane recovery efforts.</p>

            <title>New Zealand Puts Limits on Goodbyes (2024/10/24)</title>

<p>While emotional goodbyes are common at airports, one airport in New Zealand is not having any of it.</p>
<p>Travelers at New Zealand's Dunedin Airport have a new three-minute limit to say goodbye at the airport's <strong>drop off</strong> area.</p>
<p>The goal is to prevent traffic jams at the travel center.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A sign informing time limits for visitors to the passenger drop-off area outside Dunedin Airport in Momona, New Zealand, Oct. 8, 2024.

(Sarah Soper/Dunedin Airport via AP)</span></div>
<p>A sign warns: “<strong>Max</strong> hug time three minutes.” Anything longer and people should go to the parking lot instead.</p>
<p>The limit was put in place in September to “keep things moving smoothly,” airport chief Dan De Bono told the Associated Press. It was the airport's way of reminding people that the area was for “quick <strong>farewells</strong>” only.</p>
<p>The sign, however, has caused a big reaction on social media, De Bono said.</p>
<p>“We were accused of <strong>breaching</strong> basic human rights and how dare we limit how long someone can have a hug for,” he said. But others welcomed the change.</p>
<p>The signs were meant as a different answer to the problem. In Britain, airports warn of seizing vehicles with wheel clamps or fines for drivers parked in drop-off areas. Some British airports have fees for all drop-offs no matter how long.</p>
<p>De Bono said three minutes was enough time to “pull up, say farewell to your loved ones and move on.” “The time limit is really a nicer way of saying, you know, get on with it,” he added.</p>
<p>De Bono added that a 20-second hug is long enough to release the <strong>hormone</strong> oxytocin, which is linked to feelings of well-being among other things. Anything longer is just “really awkward,” said the chief, noting that there are no “hug” police.</p>
<p>However, visitors might be asked to move long hugs to the parking lot where they can stop at no cost for up to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The United States said on Wednesday that it had seen evidence of North Korean troops in Russia. And South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers that about 3,000 soldiers had been sent to support Russia's war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Speaking in Rome, Italy, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, "There is evidence that there are DPRK troops in Russia.” DPRK is short for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name.</p>
<p>Austin said it would be "very, very serious" if the North Koreans were preparing to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, as Ukraine's government has claimed. However, the defense chief added that it remained to be seen what the North Korean soldiers are doing in Russia.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="A man walks past a newspaper displayed on a street for the public in Seoul on October 21, 2024, with coverage on North Korea's decision to deploy thousands of soldiers to Ukraine.

<p><strong>3000 troops sent to Russia</strong></p>
<p>South Korean intelligence first reported that the Russian navy had taken 1,500 North Korean special warfare troops to Russia last week. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his government had intelligence information saying that 10,000 North Korean soldiers are preparing to join the invading Russian forces.</p>
<p>South Korean lawmakers then said that intelligence chief Cho Tae-yong told them another 1,500 had entered Russia, with thousands more expected to follow.</p>
<p>Park Sun-won, a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said after the briefing that troops seem to have gone to several training centers in Russia. They are “adapting to the local environment,” Park added.</p>
<p>South Korean intelligence officials also said that North Korea had sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other weapons to Russia since August 2023.</p>
<p>The Ukraine conflict broke out when Russia invaded the country in February 2022. The war has largely been fought along the front lines in eastern Ukraine, with huge numbers of <strong>casualties </strong>on both sides.</p>
<p>Austin said the North Korean deployment could be additional evidence that the Russian military was having problems with <strong>manpower</strong>.</p>
<p>In the past, Russia has dismissed South Korea's claims about the North's troop deployment, calling it "fake news." And a North Korean representative to the United Nations in New York called the claims "groundless rumors" at a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Both countries have also denied weapons transfers. But the two countries have agreed to increase military ties. And they signed a <strong>mutual</strong> defense treaty at a meeting in June.</p>
<p>Lee Seong-kweun, another South Korean lawmaker, said intelligence officials confirmed that Russia had <strong>recruited</strong> a "large number" of <strong>interpreters</strong> for the North Korean soldiers. The Russians are also training the North Korean soldiers in the use of modern military weapons, such as drones.</p>
<p>North Korea has 1.2 million troops - one of the largest standing armies in the world. But it has not fought in large conflicts since the 1950-1953 Korean War.</p>
<p>Many experts question how much North Korean troops would help Russia, noting a shortage of battle experience. They say North Korea wants to get Russian economic support and wants its help to modernize the North's weapons systems.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, South Korea's presidential office urged an immediate withdrawal of the North's troops from Russia. South Korean officials warned that it may consider supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine if military ties between Russia and North Korea went too far.</p>

            <title>Big Tech Companies Aim to Develop Small Nuclear Reactors (2024/10/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<span class="datetime">22 October, 2024</span><br/>
<p>Technology company Amazon recently said it is investing in small nuclear reactors to meet its increasing need for electricity.</p>
<p>Amazon's announcement came two days after a similar statement from technology company Google.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is gaining attention as the owner of the Three Mile Island nuclear power station in Pennsylvania announced last month that it will restart the reactor there.</p>
<div class="contentImage"><img alt="The Google logo, left, is displayed at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., on July 19, 2016, and the Amazon logo is displayed on the exterior wall of the Amazon OXR1 fulfillment center in Oxnard, Calif., on Aug. 21, 2024.

<p>The goal is to sell the energy from the nuclear station to Microsoft to power its huge data centers.</p>
<p>All three companies, Microsoft, Amazon and Google, operate large data centers. They have been spending a lot of money on solar and wind power to create and use electricity that does not produce <strong>greenhouse gases</strong>. However, their energy needs are so great that they need to find other ways to produce clean energy. Nuclear energy does not create greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency in Paris predicts that data centers will use 1,000 terawatts of electricity in 2026. One terawatt is equal to 1 million <strong>megawatts</strong>. That is double the amount from 2022.</p>
<p>Data centers are important to artificial intelligence or AI systems. AI tools use huge amounts of information to “learn” to do things in a way that is almost human.</p>
<p>Kevin Miller is an official with Amazon Web Services. Miller told the Associated Press, “AI is driving a <strong>significant</strong> increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the <strong>grid</strong>.” He said adding nuclear power was very important.</p>
<p><strong>Small modular reactors</strong></p>
<p>Small modular reactors can generate up to one third of the power that a traditional nuclear reactor can. Recently, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm spoke at Amazon's second headquarters in Virginia. Speaking of energy production, Granholm said modular reactors are a “huge piece of how we're going to solve this <strong>puzzle</strong>.” Granholm said the department will provide $900 million to produce more reactors.</p>
<p>Developers say small reactors can be built faster and at a lower cost than large reactors. The developers say they will be able to produce electricity by the early 2030s if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives them permission.</p>
<p>Kathryn Huff is a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and former official at the U.S. Department of Energy. Huff said, if new, clean power is not added as data centers expand, the U.S. risks “browning the grid,” or including more power from sources that are not clean: coal, oil and gas.</p>
<p>Small modular reactors are currently under development. They reportedly do not provide power to the U.S. grid. However, big investors can help them develop. Huff said the recent announcements could be an “inflection point” or a sign that things are changing.</p>
<p>A professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jacopo Buongiorno, said the industry needs buyers who value dependable and clean energy. They only have to be willing to pay more for it at first until the cost comes down.</p>
<p>On October 14, Google said it signed an agreement with Kairos Power based in Alameda, California. Google said it would buy energy from several small, modular reactors.</p>
<p>Google said it expects the first modular reactors to start operations by 2030 with additional ones coming through the year 2035. The deal is expected to generate 500 megawatts of electricity. However, Google's own environmental <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf">report</a> estimated that the company used 24 terawatts of electricity last year.</p>
<p>Amazon's October 16 announcement said the company was working with Dominion Energy to study building modular reactors near the North Anna nuclear station in Virginia. The company said it is investing in X-energy, a reactor developer based in Maryland. Amazon is also working with Energy Northwest in Washington state.</p>
<p>The combined deals could produce 5000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s. However, that is likely a small part of Amazon's total power use, which it does not release to the public.</p>
<p>Doug True is an official with the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group. He said new reactor designs could meet industrial needs because of their small size and dependability.</p>
<p>“It seems like a really good fit to support those <strong>facilities</strong>, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that's needed by the customer,” True said.</p>

            <title>Study: Deep Ocean Heatwaves Highly 'Under-reported' (2024/10/23)</title>

<p>Periods of very high temperatures, or heatwaves, deep in the ocean might be highly “under-reported,” a recent study says. The study suggests such heatwaves could have worrying effects in the future.</p>
<p>Australia's national science agency (CSIRO) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences worked together to do the research, which appeared recently in the scientific publication <em><a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08051-2" target="_blank">Nature.</a> </em></p>
<p>Researchers found that 80 percent of marine heatwaves below 100 meters are independent of surface events.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Bleached corals are seen in a reef in Koh Mak, Trat province, Thailand, May 8, 2024.

<p>CSIRO scientist Ming Feng said, "These findings deepen our understanding of the <strong>frequency </strong>and <strong>intensity </strong>of extreme temperature events under the ocean surface and possible <strong>implications</strong>."</p>
<p>Marine heatwaves are temperature events that can cause severe damage to marine living environments. Such effects include damage to coral reefs and <strong>species</strong> displacement, the study said.</p>
<p>These heatwave events are becoming more common due to global warming, causing major environmental and socioeconomic effects, the study suggested.</p>
<p>The majority of previous studies on marine heatwaves have depended on surface signals based on widely available satellite observations of sea-surface temperature.</p>
<p>For this study, researchers used data from eight <strong>mooring</strong> sites. These locations permit a direct estimate of the occurrence of ocean temperature extremes.</p>
<p>The study also used observational data from more than two million ocean temperature profiles from global oceans.</p>
<p>The finding of separate, deeper warming was particularly worrying, the research found. Such warming is of concern because it affects the living area, or habitat, of so many creatures and the food they eat.</p>
<p>"Extreme temperature events below the sea surface are of greater ecological concern because they affect the habitat of most marine primary producers and consumers," the study said.</p>
<p>The research also highlighted the effects of ocean currents on marine heatwaves, in particular eddies.</p>
<p>Eddies are circular currents of water that are likely a major driver of subsurface events, CSIRO suggested.</p>
<p>Ocean eddies can affect acidity levels, oxygen levels and nutrient concentrations in the ocean.</p>
<p>The study suggested that understanding the drivers of subsurface marine heatwaves can help to improve assessment of these events in a warming climate and help to predict them in the future.</p>

            <title>Conservatives Want to Deny Migrant Children Right to Education (2024/10/23)</title>
            <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

<p>For many years, children of families living in the United States illegally have had the right to attend public school based on a 1982 Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>The justices said it is unconstitutional to deny children an education based on their immigration <strong>status</strong>.</p>
<p>But conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee are now questioning that right. They also raise the possibility of <strong>challenging</strong> the decision known as <em>Plyler v. Doe</em>. The Supreme Court's conservative majority has already overturned previous decisions on abortion rights and the use of race for admissions<strong> </strong>in higher education.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - Damien Salinas, center front, arrives at school on Sept. 7, 2023, in New York.

<p>Supporters of the 1982 decision fear it could become a national issue if former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House. Trump has made immigration a central part of his 2024 presidential campaign. He promises to carry out the largest operation in history to expel immigrants from the country if elected.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult requirements</strong></p>
<p>The debate over welcoming immigrant children into public schools has also reached the small town of Saugus, near Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>At a recent meeting, the Saugus Public Schools Committee approved a new admissions policy. The policy requires new students to share immigration records. Families must sign a <strong>residency</strong> statement and provide housing and identity documents. It said the purpose was to simplify the process of registering students.</p>
<p>But, some are criticizing the policy's requirement for proof of "legal" residency and the threat of “criminal and civil” punishment for violators. They say it has another goal: keeping immigrants out of the small town's schools.</p>
<p>Civil rights lawyers say the Saugus requirements are too difficult for all to complete and violate federal law. They say the requirements unfairly harm students from immigrant families. They say even those living in the country legally may lack many of the required documents.</p>
<p>Vincent Serino is head of the Saugus school committee. He said during the August meeting that the policy is "tightening up" of existing residency rules and is not intended to keep out immigrants.</p>
<p>But a Nicaraguan woman told the Associated Press that it took six months to register her 8-year-old child because of the document requirements. The woman said the town would not accept her housing papers and the school did not answer when she spoke about the problems.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility of changes ahead</strong></p>
<p>In Saugus, the number of students who learn English has grown to 31 percent over the last ten years. In 2021, the national average for English learners in public schools was 10 percent, with the highest being Texas schools at 20 percent.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of immigrants in public schools makes it necessary to make changes in order to serve larger numbers of English learners.</p>
<p>But until recently, educators and officials would not have accepted the idea of denying children an education. Tom K. Wong is director of the U.S. immigration Policy Center at the University of California, San Diego. He said that now such ideas are becoming accepted in certain political circles.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the conservative Heritage Foundation urged states to pass laws requiring public schools to ask families living in the country illegally to pay for their children to attend.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Ryan Walters, head of Oklahoma's State Department of Education, said his agency would ask schools to collect information on the cost of illegal immigration. Several school systems have pushed back, saying they will not check students' immigration status.</p>
<p>Chris Payne is a spokesperson for Union Public Schools in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He said federal law bans schools “from asking students or their families about their immigration status or to request documentation of their citizenship."</p>
<p>Attempts to limit children of immigrants in public schools have also failed in the states of Tennessee and Texas so far.</p>
<p>Back in Massachusetts, legal experts say the policy has been a problem for at least two immigrant families trying to register children in Saugus schools. And it took their involvement to get the students into the school.</p>
<p>"The policy itself is illegal," said Oren Sellstrom of Lawyers for Civil Rights. "Schools should be welcoming (all) children who are in the district and educating them."</p>

<p class="Body">The system works by combining past weather predictions with modern forecasting models to provide the most complete picture of weather and climate.</p>
<p class="Body">In Europe, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has been using AI prediction tools since January. The organization provides detailed weather forecasts four times per day to nations across Europe.</p>
<p class="Body">The ECMWF technology is called the Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System (AIFS). The group <a class="wsw__a" href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/newsletter/178/news/aifs-new-ecmwf-forecasting-system">describes</a> the system as a “data-driven" forecasting model. It is designed to make many predictions quickly, including for extreme events involving powerful storms and heatwaves.</p>
<p class="Body">AI-supported data from the ECMWF correctly predicted intense rains last month across parts of Europe that resulted in widespread flooding. But while the predictions were right, destruction caused by the flooding could not be avoided.</p>
<p class="Body">Experts told Reuters this is largely because it is still difficult to gather and fully <strong>utilize</strong> some collected weather data. In addition, there is a need to strengthen and improve current AI models used to predict weather.</p>
<p class="Body">Andrew Charlton-Perez is a professor of meteorology – the scientific study of weather processes – at the University of Reading in Britain. He told Reuters, "In some cases and for some <strong>variables</strong>, AI models can beat physics-based models, but in other cases <strong>vice versa</strong>."</p>
<p class="Body">Charlton-Perez said one problem is that the effectiveness of an AI model is based on the information it is given. Weather disasters can be harder to predict if there is too little data to enter into AI systems. This can also be true if extreme events happen repeatedly at different times of the year or in different areas.</p>
<p class="Body">Charlton-Perez said he thinks the best use of AI-based weather forecasts would be to use them in combination with traditional weather predicting tools. This, he noted, could utilize AI data to produce weather predictions based on large sets of information collected from multiple sources.</p>
<p class="Body">Thomas Wostal is with the weather observatory GeoSphere in Austria. He told Reuters his group's models correctly predicted 300 to 400 millimeters of local rains in September. And records show that same amount actually fell in the storms.</p>
<p class="Body">But scientists say even in cases where predictions are correct, effective communication is needed to get the information out to communities and local officials so they can effectively prepare.</p>
<p class="Body">Shruti Nath is a research assistant in weather prediction and climate at Britain's Oxford University. She told Reuters, "I think what happened with (the recent floods) ... is that it's so rare - a one in 150- to 200-year event - that even if the weather models capture it, there's a reasonable degree of uncertainty."</p>
<p class="Body">Nath said AI-supported forecasts need to be clearly communicated to the public in a way that warns of the severity and possible destruction of extreme events. This way, people might see the importance of taking action before severe weather happens in order to prevent costly cleanup and recovery efforts.</p>

            <title>Scientists Expect More Solar Storms, Northern Lights (2024/10/22)</title>

<p>Space scientists say unusual lights in the sky, known as the northern lights, are more likely to appear because of intense activity on the sun.</p>
<p>The cause is the 11-year <strong>solar</strong> <strong>cycle</strong>. During a period of about 11 years, the sun's activity changes. The U.S. space agency, NASA, says changes in the sun's magnetic field cause the activity, which can result in sunspots.</p>
<p>Strong storms on the sun this year have created these “lights” in the sky called auroras. They look like moving waves of color filling the skies similar to what happens as <strong>dawn</strong> nears. Now, space scientists say these “light shows” are likely to be seen much farther south than usual.</p><div class="contentImage"><img alt="FILE - An aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, is seen in the night sky along with the Big Dipper constellation on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2024, in Moscow, Idaho.

<p>The colors in the sky that people might see may be pink, purple, green or blue. The auroras are called the northern lights because they can usually only be seen in areas in the extreme north of the world near the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>Space scientists who observe the sun through a special telescope can sometimes see darker places, called sunspots. The sunspots are areas where magnetic fields are stronger than in other places on the sun, NASA says.</p>
<p>The energy released from the interaction of these magnetic fields may cause a flare, a bright spot, which is an explosion of radiation from the sun. It shows up as a flash of light to observers.</p>
<p>Sometimes a large amount of solar material shoots away from the sun. This is called a coronal mass ejection, and it results in a geomagnetic storm when it arrives at the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>The solar cycle at a high point</strong></p>
<p>The sun is currently at the highest part of its 11-year cycle, making solar flares and northern lights more common. NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, say they expect this active period to last for at least another year. But they will not know until months later when solar activity was at its highest.</p>
<p>Kelly Korreck studies the stream of particles that come from the sun called the solar wind. Korreck led a project to develop an instrument to study the solar wind that was on NASA's Parker Solar Probe that got close to the sun in 2021.</p>
<p>The Parker Solar probe collected material and measured magnetic activity on the sun. Korreck said this solar cycle has provided more colorful auroras farther south and even more are likely. "We still could possibly get some good shows in the next few months," she added.</p>
<p><strong>Solar storms affect Earth</strong></p>
<p>Solar storms are powerful. They can temporarily <strong>disrupt</strong> electricity service and communications on Earth. NOAA follows space weather and warns operators of power stations and spacecraft in orbit.</p>
<p>In May, NOAA issued a rare severe geomagnetic storm warning. The radiation from the storm that arrived on Earth was the strongest in more than 20 years. It produced northern lights that people could see in many places in the Northern Hemisphere. That same month, scientists recorded the biggest flare <strong>erupting</strong> from the sun, but Earth was not in its path.</p>
<p>Earlier solar cycles have produced storms more intense than the one in May. Bill Murtagh is the Program Coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center at NOAA. He said space weather experts are keeping a close watch on the sun to prepare for any major problems.</p>
<p>Recently, a powerful solar storm gave those watching the sky a beautiful show far from the Arctic Circle. People could see auroras in Germany, Britain, and also in New England and New York City.</p>
